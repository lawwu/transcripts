talk about that today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And everybody should run out and read your book, Play Nice But Win.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=101" target="_blank">00:01:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm anxious to ask you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.460</a></span> | <span class="t">I would recommend they listen to it because Michael took what I understand to be a very painful process for an author to read their entire book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.780</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's Michael's voice and the inflection and the, like, you get nuances I don't think you would get just with the writing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, thank you for saying that, Bill, and appreciate the kind introduction, guys.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=124" target="_blank">00:02:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Look, I mean, I think if you're going to take the time to write a book, which is a major endeavor, if you really do it yourself and do it right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.380</a></span> | <span class="t">I did have somebody helping me, by the way, so I'm not going to take full credit for it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.580</a></span> | <span class="t">I think you should take the additional time to record the audio book because you can display emotion, intonation, and really tell the story in your own voice.</span></div><div

at the same time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And I love audio books.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.780</a></span> | <span class="t">I love going outside and walking, hiking, and turning on a good audio book is a great way to do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Totally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, in the spirit of storytelling, Michael, do you remember when you first met Gurley?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I do remember when I first met Gurley.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.160</a></span> | <span class="t">This was in the 90s.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And Bill had written this research report that was super thick.</span></div><div

know more about our business than we do?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like, what?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">We must be totally screwing up here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And he had uncovered a whole bunch of analysis and thoughts about our business.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And we were so busy, kind of distracted by growth, that we had missed a few things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And Bill shined a massive light on that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was super helpful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So I became a fan instantly of his work and have been a fan ever since.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Brad, that was 32 years

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And I've always cherished the fact that Michael's a year older than me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So I always have time to catch

about, because the 90s, I think, has some parallels to the period that we're living in now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=263"

insane, you know, balance sheet turnover in a way that the cash flow relative to the earnings was really high.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

strong buy on the initiation, which Michael made a bunch of his employees rich.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=351"

target="_blank">00:06:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It went up 100x after this initiation, like in the public markets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

like that was also part of what Michael was referring to, but their inventory turns were so damn high compared to the rest of the industry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=408" target="_blank">00:06:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So, they were, you know, building to individual customer order.</span></div><div

they got a 200 basis point gross margin advantage just by having the FIFO queue a lot shorter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=430"

target="_blank">00:07:11.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Exactly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=431"

target="_blank">00:07:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">This was a structural competitive advantage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=436" target="_blank">00:07:16.600</a></span> | <span class="t">By the way, it still is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=438" target="_blank">00:07:18.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So, the point is that the cost of the materials are always coming down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=445" target="_blank">00:07:25.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And if your competitor has, let's say, 90 days of inventory in a series of queues with distributors and dealers, and you have six days of inventory, which we actually had for about seven years in a row, six days of inventory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=463" target="_blank">00:07:43.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Think about that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=465" target="_blank">00:07:45.260</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a structural competitive advantage because you have fresher inventory, you have fresher costs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=474" target="_blank">00:07:54.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And, of course, you don't have all that capital tied up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=477" target="_blank">00:07:57.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, your return on capital is essentially infinite, especially when you're paying your suppliers on a period longer than your customers pay you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=493" target="_blank">00:08:13.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you have a negative cash conversion cycle, which we still have typically around negative 50 days cash conversion cycle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=504" target="_blank">00:08:24.940</a></span> | <span class="t">That's powerful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=505" target="_blank">00:08:25.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a beautiful thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=507" target="_blank">00:08:27.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, it is.</span></div><div

present.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=512" target="_blank">00:08:32.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Cash is king.</span></div><div

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=516" target="_blank">00:08:36.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you two just had a big win with this Invest America program that was just announced as part of the big bill.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=525" target="_blank">00:08:45.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And I know that, Brad, this was your baby, and you spent a ton of time on it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=530" target="_blank">00:08:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But Michael came on board and helped out as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=533" target="_blank">00:08:53.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So, why don't you tell everyone the details?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=536" target="_blank">00:08:56.600</a></span> | <span class="t">We've talked about it before, but tell them the details of what landed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=540" target="_blank">00:09:00.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, thanks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=541" target="_blank">00:09:01.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, I remember last 4th of July, we were talking about this bill, and I was sitting right here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=547" target="_blank">00:09:07.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And honestly, I thought the chance of getting this passed into legislation was, you know, maybe 10% at best.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=553" target="_blank">00:09:13.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And we had some good fortune.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=555" target="_blank">00:09:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">As you know, the legislation was called the Invest America Act.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=561" target="_blank">00:09:21.180</a></span> | <span class="t">It was a bipartisan, standalone bill.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=563" target="_blank">00:09:23.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And it ended up, like a lot of other pieces of legislation, getting subsumed by the reconciliation bill, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=570" target="_blank">00:09:30.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So, a lot of these things got packaged together in this one bill.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=574" target="_blank">00:09:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And, of course, it was signed into law on July 4th down at the White House.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=578" target="_blank">00:09:38.140</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I've been at this for years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=580" target="_blank">00:09:40.140</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I tried to get it done under Biden.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=582" target="_blank">00:09:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But the stars just aligned in this moment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=585" target="_blank">00:09:45.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And Michael was pretty early to get on board and support this, joined the CEO Council for Invest America, but played a critical role with the president to help get it into the reconciliation bill over the course of the last 60 days.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=600" target="_blank">00:10:00.380</a></span> | <span class="t">But let's just talk about exactly what it means now that it's become law.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=605" target="_blank">00:10:05.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I think of this as a pretty significant evolution in the social contract.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=611" target="_blank">00:10:11.420</a></span> | <span class="t">It creates private investment savings accounts, privately owned for every child at birth, seated with $1,000 in the S&P 500.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=620" target="_blank">00:10:20.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So, parents, companies, philanthropists can add money.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=623" target="_blank">00:10:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Anybody can add money to these accounts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=625" target="_blank">00:10:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You can't take the money out of the accounts, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=628" target="_blank">00:10:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">It just compounds in the S&P 500 until you're 18 years old.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=633" target="_blank">00:10:33.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we will spend the next year putting the program in place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=637" target="_blank">00:10:37.740</a></span> | <span class="t">It has to be launched under the terms of the legislation by July 4, 2026, the 250th birthday of America.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=645" target="_blank">00:10:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And basically, we got it expanded.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=648" target="_blank">00:10:48.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So, all kids under the age of 18, that's 65 million kids, are eligible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=654" target="_blank">00:10:54.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And I give a lot of credit to Senator Cruz, who fought to expand the pool of eligibility here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=660" target="_blank">00:11:00.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So, what that means is that they can open up an account, but only children born after January 1, 2025 get the $1,000 from Treasury, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=672" target="_blank">00:11:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">The others will have an account that someone else could put money in on their behalf.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=676" target="_blank">00:11:16.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And they can add money, too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=678" target="_blank">00:11:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And there are a lot of advantages for their parents adding money, for companies adding money to it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=684" target="_blank">00:11:24.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it makes a lot of sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=685" target="_blank">00:11:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And for Michael and I, I think the key performance indicator here is if we're having this conversation a year from now, we want to have 50 or 60 million kids signed up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=695" target="_blank">00:11:35.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, of course, if your child is born after July 4, 2026, then they're going to automatically get an account set up when they get their Social Security number, and they will automatically get the $1,000.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=707" target="_blank">00:11:47.100</a></span> | <span class="t">But we have this one-time group, all kids under the age of 18.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=710" target="_blank">00:11:50.860</a></span> | <span class="t">We're going to have a big campaign to get all those folks signed up over the course of the next year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=716" target="_blank">00:11:56.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And I guess for me, I was reflecting on this over the course of the last few days.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=721" target="_blank">00:12:01.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And at a time when you have an avowed socialist like Mamdani winning the primary in New York, it seems like the Invest America Act is really just the exact opposite, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=734" target="_blank">00:12:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">You're both trying to attack the problem of the wealth gap.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=738" target="_blank">00:12:18.700</a></span> | <span class="t">But this is by getting everybody into the game of capitalism, making everybody actual owners in the upside of America's success rather than resorting to price controls, attacking businesses and success, and creating really more dependency on government.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=756"

Bill, you know, in some ways, like the Giving Pledge 2.0, I mean, we've had massive wealth creation in this country, like unprecedented wealth creation in this country, right?</span></div><div

there's any other civilization in history that you can point to, okay, that has this character, which is the super wealthy in America, by and large, want to give away the vast majority of their wealth during their lifetime or shortly after they die.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=982" target="_blank">00:16:22.860</a></span> | <span

| <span class="t">Okay, think about this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=987" target="_blank">00:16:27.240</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:16:30.440</a></span> | <span class="t">It was about coming up with legal mechanisms for creating dynastic wealth so as to not give any of your money away, okay?</span></div><div

to give away large sums of money.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1001" target="_blank">00:16:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">The challenge is the charitable infrastructure has not necessarily scaled to meet the needs of people who want to give away billions of dollars at a time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1011" target="_blank">00:16:51.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And I said to, I asked Michael and Susan the question over a year ago, I said, you know, if you wanted to give away a lot of money in the state of Texas today, like how would you do it directly to kids?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1022" target="_blank">00:17:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's not a good answer, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1025" target="_blank">00:17:05.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Because there's not a financial infrastructure in place that has a set of rules associated with it, you know, where you could have somebody like the Treasury Department, we're going to have a pooled Invest America account at Treasury where Michael and Susan or other philanthropists could give money to this pooled</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1041" target="_blank">00:17:21.500</a></span> | <span class="t">account and it would be dispersed to all these kids' accounts, subject to all the rules and regulations of use so the kids can't take the money out, but they can see it compound.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1050" target="_blank">00:17:30.500</a></span> | <span class="t">That simply does not exist today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1053" target="_blank">00:17:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's impossible to do that at scale today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1056" target="_blank">00:17:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And at the long end of the curve, if you think about, you know, my family as an example, we do a lot with the East Palo Alto School District, you know, some of these low income school districts in the state of California, where I can just adopt that school and say for every kid in that school, I'm going to give a thousand dollars a year or two.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1076" target="_blank">00:17:56.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So this unlocks, I think, massive creativity, Michael, around philanthropy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1081" target="_blank">00:18:01.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's what I mean.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1083" target="_blank">00:18:03.080</a></span> | <span class="t">We know in Silicon Valley, if you build an open platform, a million applications can bloom.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1088" target="_blank">00:18:08.540</a></span> | <span class="t">A million ideas can be built on top of this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1090" target="_blank">00:18:10.940</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, we've heard from states that want to add $10,000 for every kid born in the state if they, you know, if they graduate from high school in the state.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1099" target="_blank">00:18:19.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think we haven't even scratched the surface of the beautiful competition and the beautiful philanthropy and the long tail of philanthropy, churches and parents and friends that we'll be able to give to these accounts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1113" target="_blank">00:18:33.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so our job is to make sure that we make it as frictionless as possible, that we work and we're – that's one of the core things that we're doing now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1122" target="_blank">00:18:42.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And you're describing those accounts don't solely take money at the initiation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1127" target="_blank">00:18:47.180</a></span> | <span class="t">They can take money all along the way, which is how you could support a school or something like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1133" target="_blank">00:18:53.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Correct.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1133" target="_blank">00:18:53.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So the way it works, Bill, is – and all of this, I mean, Michael and I, I think, learned a lot about the act of legislation going through this because, you know, it's one thing to get it put in a reconciliation bill.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1147" target="_blank">00:19:07.240</a></span> | <span class="t">It's one thing to get high-level buy-in, but just in the last two weeks, we were negotiating the nitty-gritty.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1153" target="_blank">00:19:13.700</a></span> | <span class="t">I think this was 23 pages of tax, you know, changes in the reconciliation bill associated with the Invest America Act.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1161" target="_blank">00:19:21.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So families can give – or recipients can receive up to $5,000 a year from family, from friends, you know, et cetera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1171" target="_blank">00:19:31.120</a></span> | <span

together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1197" target="_blank">00:19:57.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And we're going to go to the

to the largest companies in America, and we're going to ask them all to do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1202" target="_blank">00:20:02.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, we're not telling them the amount they need to give.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1205" target="_blank">00:20:05.240</a></span> | <span class="t">All we're saying is give an amount that's appropriate to your company and to your employee base.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1210" target="_blank">00:20:10.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I just heard from Tony yesterday at DoorDash.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1213" target="_blank">00:20:13.880</a></span> | <span class="t">He retweeted something about this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1215" target="_blank">00:20:15.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Sam Altman I heard from over the weekend once he heard it was passed, you know, retweeted something about this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1220" target="_blank">00:20:20.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think the business enthusiasm is going to be very big and substantial.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1226" target="_blank">00:20:26.820</a></span> | <span class="t">But remember, the most powerful givers are moms and dads, grandparents, friends, birthdays, and bar mitzvahs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1234" target="_blank">00:20:34.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And all of those dollars ultimately, like, don't really generally find a home for savings and compounding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1240" target="_blank">00:20:40.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And we're going to make it as easy as Venmoing in this money, Apple paying money in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1245" target="_blank">00:20:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, one of the studies that we did that was really profound in partnership with the Milken Institute, they found a whole host of things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1255" target="_blank">00:20:55.540</a></span> | <span class="t">One was that low-income cohorts tend to save at about the same rate as higher-income cohorts if they have an account.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1265" target="_blank">00:21:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">The problem is that nobody in a low-income cohort has a savings account or investment account.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1270" target="_blank">00:21:10.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think you're going to see, you know, a lot of contributions by all sorts of folks once we set this up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1278" target="_blank">00:21:18.260</a></span> | <span class="t">We also learned that once we do this, kids are more likely to graduate from high school and college, more likely to start a business, more likely to buy a home, less likely to be incarcerated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1288" target="_blank">00:21:28.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think the societal ROI of this will be really large over time.</span></div><div

where if someone wanted to donate, Michael mentioned zip codes, but some other way that if people wanted to just target the low-income, most needy, that there'll be a way to do that.</span></div><div

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1308" target="_blank">00:21:48.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, this was a really important issue to Michael and to myself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1312" target="_blank">00:21:52.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, I'll just, you know, give you a bit of a window into the weeds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1316" target="_blank">00:21:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, we tried to get household income as one of the targeting mechanisms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1323" target="_blank">00:22:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And we weren't able to get bipartisan agreement on that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1326" target="_blank">00:22:06.500</a></span> | <span class="t">But we were able to get a proxy for that, which is you can target by zip codes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1332" target="_blank">00:22:12.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can target down to groups of 5,000 or more by zip code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1336" target="_blank">00:22:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And we think through that geotargeting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1338" target="_blank">00:22:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So, for example, Michael could target the Rio Grande Valley.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1342" target="_blank">00:22:22.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I could target, you know, East Oakland.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1345" target="_blank">00:22:25.700</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, so there are zip codes that you could target that I think certainly include a predominance of lower-income households.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1354" target="_blank">00:22:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">That's fantastic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1356" target="_blank">00:22:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Hey, Bill, I know you've been involved in financial literacy and education for a long time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1362" target="_blank">00:22:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Tell us about the organization you're partnering with and, you know, perhaps as, you know, kind of a potential partnership for Invest America.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1371" target="_blank">00:22:51.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, my wife and I have been giving to an organization called Next Gen Personal Finance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1377" target="_blank">00:22:57.340</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a gentleman there named Tim Ranzetta who has just been pushing for financial literacy in high schools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1384" target="_blank">00:23:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So we can add a link in here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1386" target="_blank">00:23:06.580</a></span> | <span class="t">But from 2021 to 2025, in only a four-year window, we've gone from 11 states to 29 states.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1395" target="_blank">00:23:15.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And Texas just passed this very recently, a few weeks ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1399" target="_blank">00:23:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the idea, which sounds obvious, it's actually quite shocking that it's not true, is just to add a semester of financial literacy to the high school curriculum.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1410" target="_blank">00:23:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, we send kids out to get jobs and we haven't taught them, you know, how credit cards might take advantage of them and how to build a monthly budget and how to use a checkbook and, you know, how to plan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1424" target="_blank">00:23:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I think, you know, these two things complement each other quite a bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1429" target="_blank">00:23:49.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But that's another movement that it's nice to see gaining momentum simultaneously with this one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1436" target="_blank">00:23:56.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1436" target="_blank">00:23:56.840</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I talked to Tim.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1438" target="_blank">00:23:58.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Texas just became, you know, like you said, 29th state, I think, to require a semester of financial literacy education.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1447" target="_blank">00:24:07.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, some people said, you know, the Treasury Department, Invest America, they're not going to own the financial literacy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1455" target="_blank">00:24:15.660</a></span> | <span class="t">What, again, I think when you create a platform of ownership, now it makes all of these financial literacy programs and organizations across the country just way more effective.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1465" target="_blank">00:24:25.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. Because when you're talking to a kid who actually, you say, open up your Invest America account on your phone, let's talk about how you got $12,000, $14,000 into that account.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1476" target="_blank">00:24:36.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's look at how it's compounded.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1478" target="_blank">00:24:38.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's talk about what it means to own the companies that are listed there, what it means to be a shareholder.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1483" target="_blank">00:24:43.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I think you just have a much more engaged student.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1486" target="_blank">00:24:46.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. Because today, 95 percent of those students don't own anything and they look at their parents and their parents don't really own things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1494" target="_blank">00:24:54.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it's a lot harder to get motivated to learn about something when you don't think you're going to have the prospect of ownership.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1500" target="_blank">00:25:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">There are so many great organizations like Tim's out there, and I look forward to seeing how they take this platform and run with it to turbocharge their own efforts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1509" target="_blank">00:25:09.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Brad, I know you wanted to mention the budget deficit and the funding for this program and put it in a little bit of perspective, just with all the talk and concern about how big the budget deficit is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1523" target="_blank">00:25:23.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. I mean, listen, you know, we've had a huge debate among our friend group about this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1532" target="_blank">00:25:32.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, and some of my friends were even critical that, you know, this is part of the problem, if you will.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1536" target="_blank">00:25:36.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, to break this down, the max cost of this is three point seven billion a year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1543" target="_blank">00:25:43.720</a></span> | <span class="t">We have three point seven million kids born every year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1546" target="_blank">00:25:46.980</a></span> | <span class="t">If you give them each a thousand dollars, that's three point seven billion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1550" target="_blank">00:25:50.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So just to, you know, kind of put that in context, three point seven billion is about what we contribute.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1557" target="_blank">00:25:57.180</a></span> | <span class="t">We give to Afghanistan and Nigeria in the terms of foreign aid every year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1561" target="_blank">00:26:01.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think one of the things as a country we just have to ask is about priorities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1565" target="_blank">00:26:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Is it more important to give every kid in America a private investment account, a little seed from birth and get them on the right track or to give three and a half billion dollars to Afghanistan, Nigeria?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1574" target="_blank">00:26:14.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think those are the type of choices we're going to be forced to make.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1578" target="_blank">00:26:18.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm not saying that the dollars going to Afghanistan, Nigeria are wasted.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1582" target="_blank">00:26:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But we make these decisions every single day in our budget.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1586" target="_blank">00:26:26.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And so for me, this is, you know, that's one angle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1589" target="_blank">00:26:29.900</a></span> | <span class="t">The second angle is just as a percentage of our national revenue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1593" target="_blank">00:26:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">This is one one hundredth of one percent of our national revenue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1598" target="_blank">00:26:38.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's pretty inconsequential in terms of the overall budget.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1602" target="_blank">00:26:42.120</a></span> | <span class="t">But the final point on it is, as you've heard me argue, according to the studies that were done on this, this will actually be revenue contributing 20 to 30 years out because the taxes you have to pay when you exit the accounts on the capital gains will be more than what the government is contributing on an annual basis into the accounts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1622" target="_blank">00:27:02.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And so among the things we should be worried about when it comes to the budget, I don't think this is one of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1627" target="_blank">00:27:07.580</a></span> | <span class="t">However, I would say unquestionably that I remain as concerned about the budget deficit as ever and, you know, been a supporter of a balanced budget amendment for a long time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1639" target="_blank">00:27:19.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I happen to think that this is something that is aligned with that, not at odds with that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1644" target="_blank">00:27:24.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Making every kid a capitalist from birth is going to better align us with the policies that allow the company country to continue to grow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1652" target="_blank">00:27:32.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think growth is a critical element to making sure that we get our deficit to GDP back in a, you know, in a manageable place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1660" target="_blank">00:27:40.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Michael, I know you care a lot about that issue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1663" target="_blank">00:27:43.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Any any other thoughts on on that particular point?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1665" target="_blank">00:27:45.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I mean, governments obviously been spending too much and there's been some some renewed attention and focus on that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1674" target="_blank">00:27:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">That's that's a good thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1675" target="_blank">00:27:55.860</a></span> | <span class="t">It gets priced into to the currency.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1679" target="_blank">00:27:59.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1679" target="_blank">00:27:59.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And we see it in all the effects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1682" target="_blank">00:28:02.680</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, whether it's inflation or the value of the currency and you can't really escape that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1693" target="_blank">00:28:13.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the the the spending has to come under control.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1698" target="_blank">00:28:18.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, maybe we get this incredible productivity lift.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1702" target="_blank">00:28:22.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm sure we're going to talk about that as we get to the AI fund portion here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1707" target="_blank">00:28:27.580</a></span> | <span class="t">But we shouldn't be spending so much more than than we're taking that as as a government.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1716" target="_blank">00:28:36.600</a></span> | <span class="t">We, you know, we I've sort of stepped back from the hysterics and say we don't have a loan to value problem as a country.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1725" target="_blank">00:28:45.060</a></span> | <span

class="t">Talk to us about that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1730" target="_blank">00:28:50.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to dig into that because it's a really important point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1733" target="_blank">00:28:53.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Talked about loan to value.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1735" target="_blank">00:28:55.220</a></span> | <span class="t">When you say loan to value, what do you mean by that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1738" target="_blank">00:28:58.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, what I mean is the value, the the, you know, loan to value is a common term and phraseology used in banking and credit markets and essentially refers to, you know, the the amount of a of a loan relative to the value that it's being borrowed upon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1760" target="_blank">00:29:20.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you think about the deficit, you know, as against the value of all the assets in the United States, we don't have a loan to value problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1771" target="_blank">00:29:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And of course, the total value of all the assets in the United States are a couple hundred trillion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1776" target="_blank">00:29:36.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Our annual deficit is two trillion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1778" target="_blank">00:29:38.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So you would look at that and say, as a loan to value, that's not an issue at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1782" target="_blank">00:29:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I would look at the total deficit as against the total value of the assets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=1788"

reduce this down to a race to superintelligence or something along those lines, the size of the prize is tremendous.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=2581" target="_blank">00:43:01.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And they do have an incredible business that is aided by these advancements in a big way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=2589" target="_blank">00:43:09.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And there aren't a whole ton of companies that can go do this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=2594" target="_blank">00:43:14.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=2595" target="_blank">00:43:15.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And by the way, Brad, you mentioned that they have this unfair advantage of this huge printing press.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=2601" target="_blank">00:43:21.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But Apple and Google have the same exact printing press and chose not to do this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=2607" target="_blank">00:43:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But neither of them are controlled by founders.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=2610" target="_blank">00:43:30.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, that's what I was – the point I was trying to make.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=2614" target="_blank">00:43:34.600</a></span> | <span class="t">These are the type of bets that I think it's very, very difficult for a Google or an Apple to make.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=2620" target="_blank">00:43:40.680</a></span> | <span class="t">For the reasons you mentioned, Bill, you know, can they sell it to the public markets?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=2625" target="_blank">00:43:45.300</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, do they have the type of decision-making in the boardroom that allows this to occur?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=2631" target="_blank">00:43:51.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, at the end of the day, I think at Meta, if Zuckerberg wants to do it, that's what's happening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=2636" target="_blank">00:43:56.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And that board, you know, gets on board.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=2639" target="_blank">00:43:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, he's reshaped the board over the course of the last couple of years with folks who are, I think, signed up for this mission with him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=2647" target="_blank">00:44:07.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Michael, to your point, that's why I think he reorganized this into the kind of super intelligence division.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=2654" target="_blank">00:44:14.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the way they'll try to manage this culturally is to say, listen, there's going to be an elite SEAL Team 6 group, which is called super intelligence, and we're going to pay them elite pay because it's good for the entire business.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=2668" target="_blank">00:44:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">That doesn't mean we're going to inflate everybody else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=2672" target="_blank">00:44:32.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And in fact, what I think that Meta will do is, you know, you'll probably see them rolling back like you see with Microsoft, like you see with Amazon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=2682" target="_blank">00:44:42.040</a></span> | <span class="t">My sense is that companies are generally going to get smaller, right, on the backs of the productivity gains from AI, but they'll redeploy some of those profits into these areas.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=2692" target="_blank">00:44:52.060</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're in the model business and you want to be on the frontier competing for super intelligence and there are only, whatever, five to seven companies that really are in that game, then I think you're going to have to have something similar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=2705" target="_blank">00:45:05.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, in the case of OpenAI, it's only 2,800 employees, and they're all part of that division, effectively.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=2712" target="_blank">00:45:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But you have to really get scale quickly because if you're not bringing in $10, $20, $30, $40 billion of annual revenue, I don't think you can stay in this game.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=2722" target="_blank">00:45:22.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the question is whether or not Anthropic and X and OpenAI have a sufficient escape velocity, right, that they can take on this frontal assault by Meta and still compete.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=2738" target="_blank">00:45:38.920</a></span> | <span class="t">My sense is OpenAI does – my sense is both of those companies do, but it's not a long list that can compete with them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=2745" target="_blank">00:45:45.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And by the way, the Nat Friedman addition was particularly interesting just with his GitHub background.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=2750" target="_blank">00:45:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, we had talked in the past that Meta had made a couple of hires on the enterprise side, and we'd heard rumors of, you know, certain payments when they passed through the cap on the open models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=2763" target="_blank">00:46:03.300</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, you have to wonder with Nat coming on board if there are more aspirations on the enterprise side.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=2769" target="_blank">00:46:09.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=2770" target="_blank">00:46:10.440</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a great point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=2772" target="_blank">00:46:12.900</a></span> | <span class="t">It certainly wants to create some optionality there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=2775" target="_blank">00:46:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Hey, Michael, question for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=2777" target="_blank">00:46:17.300</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, on this related topic of productivity gains from leveraging AI and kind of what you're seeing at Dell, we've talked on this podcast what we call the golden age of margin expansion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=2789" target="_blank">00:46:29.300</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, this idea that you're seeing AI has certainly re-accelerated your top line in a pretty dramatic way, but it's doing that at a lot of companies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=2798" target="_blank">00:46:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">At the same time, you're able to do more with less.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=2801" target="_blank">00:46:41.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Is that overstated, or do you think that we're in this phase over the next three, four, five years where generally as an economy, and certainly within a lot of companies,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=2812" target="_blank">00:46:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that they're going to be able to, you know, have their top lines grow faster than their operating costs because of AI?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=2820" target="_blank">00:47:00.100</a></span> | <span class="t">It's absolutely real, Brad, and we are doing it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=2825" target="_blank">00:47:05.460</a></span> | <span class="t">We know of other companies that are doing it, and I think, you know, maybe only 10% of companies, large companies have figured this out,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=2835" target="_blank">00:47:15.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and the other 90% are sort of a bit confused at this point, but, you know, if I step back and look at this, you know, 10% productivity improvements, pretty easy, 20%, you know, reasonably common sightings of 30% or 40%, those are massive numbers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=2857" target="_blank">00:47:37.160</a></span> | <span class="t">If you sort of step back and think about this, you know, you've got $114 trillion global economy, right, in 2025, and services economy is two-thirds of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=2869" target="_blank">00:47:49.360</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, if we believe that a 10% improvement is possible in productivity, if you just keep it simple and you say 10% improvement, that's worth $10 trillion, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=2884" target="_blank">00:48:04.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the amount of investment that is occurring today in AI could be quite a bit less than is really justified.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=2894" target="_blank">00:48:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, if we believe in a 10% to 20% improvement, and I don't say that lightly because that's like an enormous thing if it were to occur, but let's just stick with this for a second.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=2908" target="_blank">00:48:28.520</a></span> | <span class="t">If we believe in a 10% improvement, if we believe in a 10% improvement, the investment in AI should be more on the order of $2 to $4 trillion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=2916" target="_blank">00:48:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Per year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=2918" target="_blank">00:48:38.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=2919"

target="_blank">00:48:41.720</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a lot less than that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=2924" target="_blank">00:48:44.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, I don't want to get too ahead of myself here, but I do think there is a big change that is occurring, and we're just at the beginning of it, and it's going to affect every part of our world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=2944"

Google, they figured out how to gain, you know, like, I think a booking.com, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=3061"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=3066" target="_blank">00:51:06.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I would say, like, they figured out productivity gains before the next person, and that was hugely advantageous.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=3074" target="_blank">00:51:14.440</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=3127" target="_blank">00:52:07.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think this is all going to play out, you know, in the next three to five years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=3135" target="_blank">00:52:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And it will become sort of an

target="_blank">00:52:49.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And that new competitor is going to be in every business that we're in, except they're going to be faster and more efficient and more

year over year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=3254" target="_blank">00:54:14.420</a></span> | <span class="t">In the first quarter,

happened?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=3300" target="_blank">00:55:00.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, you know, we were

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=3330" target="_blank">00:55:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, we – tons of engineering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=3336" target="_blank">00:55:36.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And obviously, there's a logistics of the supply chain.</span></div><div

them work reliably is super complex.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=3349" target="_blank">00:55:49.400</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:55:55.560</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, we often will help with the financing of these with our Dell financial services.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=3363" target="_blank">00:56:03.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, the scale of these things is enormous.</span></div><div

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=3382" target="_blank">00:56:22.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you put that in the context of Google statements or Microsoft statements, I

class="t">So the thing that I'm – you know, a year ago, we were all sitting around and talking about the ups and downs of the overbuild in 2000, right, around the internet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=3448" target="_blank">00:57:28.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, and yet when I look at the trajectory that we're on, right, I saw Mike Intratore on, you know, CNBC today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=3459" target="_blank">00:57:39.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And he said, listen, we're still underestimating the amount of demand that's out there in the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=3464" target="_blank">00:57:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And when he says it or when you say it or when Jensen says it, in some ways, people would argue it's self-serving.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=3470" target="_blank">00:57:50.660</a></span> | <span

the period in early 2000 when we did get overbuilt, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=3490" target="_blank">00:58:10.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, as the saying goes, every shortage ends up in a glut.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=3495" target="_blank">00:58:15.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Why are we not near that point yet today in this market?</span></div><div

back and, you know, sort of review what the multiples were on earnings and cash flow, you know, around that time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=3517" target="_blank">00:58:37.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We're nowhere near that for the most part.</span></div><div class="c"><span

tokens, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=3531" target="_blank">00:58:51.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And as we go from basic queries to test time compute to deep reasoning to agents and multi-agent systems, the number of tokens just explodes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

target="_blank">01:00:27.400</a></span> | <span class="t">What can you share about on-prem AI deployments, Michael?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=3631" target="_blank">01:00:31.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Are you seeing anything interesting there?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=3632" target="_blank">01:00:32.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so we, we, in the last year, you know, delivered a little over 3,000 of these Dell AI factories.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=3645" target="_blank">01:00:45.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, those are increasingly to enterprise and commercial customers that want to bring the AI to their data, not the data to the AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=3657" target="_blank">01:00:57.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=3657" target="_blank">01:00:57.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, there's just a ton of data that is still on-prem and being generated on-prem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=3664" target="_blank">01:01:04.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And it turns out, you know, these large models are fantastic, but you don't always need the largest model to solve every problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=3673" target="_blank">01:01:13.560</a></span> | <span class="t">A lot of the corporate use cases are perfectly done with smaller models and open source models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=3682" target="_blank">01:01:22.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you see this enormous proliferation and a hugging face of models of all shapes and sizes, tons of cascading innovations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=3691" target="_blank">01:01:31.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I think this is going to be highly distributed and we're definitely seeing growth in on-prem and colos are also a big deal, you know, because many customers don't want to have the data center themselves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=3709" target="_blank">01:01:49.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so they'll, they'll put it in a co-location facility.</span></div><div

you can pay on a, you know, usage type basis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=3721" target="_blank">01:02:01.040</a></span> | <span class="t">What is your, you know, when you look at just kind of the relative distribution between, you know, kind of the custom ASICs world, what you see happening across, you know, folks like AMD and NVIDIA.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=3734" target="_blank">01:02:14.260</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, there's obviously a lot of chatter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=3736" target="_blank">01:02:16.060</a></span> | <span class="t">You have an interesting perspective, both as a consumer of these products, also as a builder and distributor of the products.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=3742" target="_blank">01:02:22.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Is, is there, are there any, you know, pending big changes or as you look ahead over the course of the next year or two, that's probably as far ahead as you can see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=3751" target="_blank">01:02:31.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Does it look like the relative landscape is stable or are there big breakthroughs coming that may unseat somebody like, like NVIDIA?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=3761" target="_blank">01:02:41.540</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, NVIDIA is in a great

think for the larger model companies and hyperscalers, certainly custom ASICs are gaining a lot of share.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=3778" target="_blank">01:02:58.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And when you have control over the workload and you can, you know, take the time to optimize your workload, you know, that's certainly going to be a part of what occurs in the infrastructure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=3796" target="_blank">01:03:16.640</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's a, it's not a large number of customers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=3799" target="_blank">01:03:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">You were talking about the number of companies developing models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=3803" target="_blank">01:03:23.420</a></span> | <span class="t">It's sort of that number of customers, but they're large, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=3806" target="_blank">01:03:26.320</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">01:03:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, maybe just in the, to be respectful of time, Bill, I could talk to Michael for, you know, for hours about this particular subject.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=3822" target="_blank">01:03:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">But maybe do, you know, one

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=3832" target="_blank">01:03:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, it's pretty incredible to see the snapback that we've seen out of the NASDAQ, the S&P.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=3839" target="_blank">01:03:59.540</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the NASDAQ is now up 32% off of its bottom two months ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=3845" target="_blank">01:04:05.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Just as a data point, I think, I think Dell got as low as, I don't know, 75, 72 bucks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=3852"

target="_blank">01:04:13.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, that is an incredible bounce off the bottom, but it's still basically up, I don't know, 5% or 10% on the year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=3860" target="_blank">01:04:20.600</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not like it's in this astronomical range when you look at kind of year to date or over the course of the last 12 months.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=3867"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=3875" target="_blank">01:04:35.740</a></span> | <span class="t">We have the NASDAQ and the Qs and the S&P at an all-time high.</span></div><div

pass?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=4063" target="_blank">01:07:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Now it's

target="_blank">01:07:52.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you have this incremental stimulus now coming from the reconciliation bill.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

absent some big blow up between us and China, you know, if we follow the Besson Accords that they reached in Switzerland and then reiterated in London, it seems like the big pieces of the tariff puzzle are falling in place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=4101" target="_blank">01:08:21.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And then on the rate front, the market is estimating that the next move is down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=4105"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=4159" target="_blank">01:09:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, I was as negative, as you well know, Michael, early in the year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=4164" target="_blank">01:09:24.300</a></span> | <span class="t">I was as negative as I've been

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=4174" target="_blank">01:09:34.700</a></span> | <span class="t">That was a scary path, you know, and, you know, we talked about how if they went down that path, I thought they would reverse course because it wouldn't work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=4184"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=4200" target="_blank">01:10:00.240</a></span> | <span class="t">We didn't do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=4200" target="_blank">01:10:00.940</a></span> | <span class="t">I hope we don't snatch defeat from the jaws of victory here with policy, though.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=4208" target="_blank">01:10:08.220</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I think, you know, going back into the tariff game, some type of bold confrontation with China and, you know, our AI policy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=4220" target="_blank">01:10:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, one thing we didn't talk about in this past week, the AI moratorium got removed from the bill, and we're going to have 70 state laws in the United States, which is not great for AI startups.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=4233" target="_blank">01:10:33.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So, anyway, I hope we don't, I hope we don't, I hope we don't, I hope bad policy doesn't upset what would be an otherwise very potent landscape based on AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=4244" target="_blank">01:10:44.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I fully agree.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=4245" target="_blank">01:10:45.780</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's one thing that the three of us are in violent agreement on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=4250" target="_blank">01:10:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the things that's moved this country forward for the last three decades is we've led globally in technology.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=4256" target="_blank">01:10:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And we've led globally in technology because we've allowed our best technologies to move freely around the world and to compete and to win.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=4263" target="_blank">01:11:03.980</a></span> | <span class="t">This is the first time since I've been in this business that we're talking about export controls and AI diffusion laws that are restricting the ability of our technology to go compete and win, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=4275" target="_blank">01:11:15.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's both the question mark as it relates to inside of China, but also the question mark outside of China.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=4281" target="_blank">01:11:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And while we've seen the repeal of the Biden diffusion rule, what I'm told is that no new licenses have been granted for, you know, for distribution of AI technologies around the world, despite all of the discussion around this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=4298" target="_blank">01:11:38.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's critical that Washington follows through and that we accelerate diffusion around the world of the entire American AI stack that we don't regulate that out of Washington.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=4311" target="_blank">01:11:51.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I think there are some legitimate regulations that you can have as it pertains to China.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=4316" target="_blank">01:11:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">But even there, I would much rather let our deprecated chips out of NVIDIA go compete against Huawei in China, keep the developer mindshare in China, because it's going to make it easier for us to win globally and elsewhere around the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=4331" target="_blank">01:12:11.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think it's important that Michael, myself, everybody else, Bill, you are those voices are being heard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=4338" target="_blank">01:12:18.500</a></span> | <span class="t">We're not out of the woods on this by a long shot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=4340" target="_blank">01:12:20.700</a></span> | <span class="t">By the way, you reminded me of one of the thing I'd just like to harp on, which is the skilled immigration piece.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=4346" target="_blank">01:12:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So someone highlighted to me that they made like the huge wanted poster of all the people that Meta has borrowed from other companies, like like 60 or 70 percent of them were were of Chinese origin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=4361" target="_blank">01:12:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And as I understand it right now, you know, there are PhD students or candidates in China that can't get visas and get in to the United States right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=4372" target="_blank">01:12:52.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And we go back to what Trump said on All In, that he wanted to staple a visa to every diploma.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=4378" target="_blank">01:12:58.900</a></span> | <span class="t">I'd really like to get not that we're in charge, but I'd love to get that conversation going again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=4384" target="_blank">01:13:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">It would be very powerful for the country to increase skilled immigration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=4389" target="_blank">01:13:09.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And it feels like we might be decreasing it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=4392" target="_blank">01:13:12.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I absolutely agree.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=4394" target="_blank">01:13:14.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And to your point, Brad, I mean, if if we don't aggressively work to, you know, sell our technologies around the world, other countries are going to do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=4408" target="_blank">01:13:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, reminded of a story long time ago, the Defense Department had this thing called MTOPS.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=4416" target="_blank">01:13:36.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was a it was a it was a Bill might remember this, but it was it was like a restriction on how fast the computer was that, you know, you had to get approval from the government and to sell it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=4429" target="_blank">01:13:49.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was in this group of technology CEOs and we we went we went to the Pentagon to talk to the generals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=4438" target="_blank">01:13:58.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And and before we went, we went to Toys R Us store and we bought a PlayStation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=4449" target="_blank">01:14:09.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And we took it out of the box and we brought it to the Pentagon, you know, this big room.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=4454" target="_blank">01:14:14.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And we, you know, set the PlayStation down on there and we said, you know, this exceeds the M top restriction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=4462" target="_blank">01:14:22.320</a></span> | <span

you know, it's not it's made by a Japanese company.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=4467" target="_blank">01:14:27.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, it doesn't fall under the rules.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=4470" target="_blank">01:14:30.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So anybody can buy it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=4472" target="_blank">01:14:32.740</a></span> | <span class="t">It's also three hundred ninety nine dollars.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=4475" target="_blank">01:14:35.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=4475" target="_blank">01:14:35.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So you guys think you're going to control the access to this thing or little things that, you know, move easily.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=4485" target="_blank">01:14:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">You're

up with more intelligent ways to restrict access to the most advanced technologies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52BNWZrXSk&t=4496" target="_blank">01:14:56.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And oftentimes you just get all kinds of unintended consequences with these rules that are created.</span></div><div class="c"><span
