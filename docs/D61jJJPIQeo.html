mine at Stanford, Chris Gardner,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=83" target="_blank">00:01:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">is a terrific professor of nutrition and has done a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=88" target="_blank">00:01:28.600</a></span> | <span class="t">important studies on how nutrition impacts different aspects of health.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.920</a></span> | <span class="t">This paper where Chris is the first author, it's Gardner et al. 2018 JAMA looked at weight loss in people following one particular diet versus another particular diet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And this was a 12 month weight loss study.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=109" target="_blank">00:01:49.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So it was focused specifically on weight loss.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Although they looked at some other parameters as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=114" target="_blank">00:01:54.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And the basic conclusion of the study was that there was no significant difference in weight</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.540</a></span> | <span class="t">change between people following a healthy low fat diet versus a healthy low carbohydrate diet with significantly more dietary fats in them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.840</a></span> | <span class="t">This caused a lot of ripples in the world of nutrition and nutritional science.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And certainly in the general population, because anyone that understands diet and nutrition would immediately say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">but wait, there are all sorts of different implications of eating one type of diet, say low carbohydrate, higher fats versus a higher carbohydrate, lower fat diet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And indeed there are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.960</a></span> | <span class="t">This study was focused specifically on fat loss and on weight loss.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So as we discuss time-restricted feeding, we need to be very precise about what are the effects of time-restricted feeding and of eating in particular ways at particular times.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">We are going to emphasize again, whether or not the study was done in mice or in humans, in athletes and men and women or both.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.620</a></span> | <span class="t">But the study from Gardner and colleagues is a beautiful study and really emphasizes that if one's main goal is simply to lose weight,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.860</a></span> | <span class="t">then it really does not matter what one eats, provided that the number of calories burned is higher than the number of calories ingested.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.900</a></span> | <span class="t">However, anyone out there who understands a little bit of biology or a lot of biology will agree that there are many factors</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">that impact that calories burned part of the equation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Some of those are obvious.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So for instance, amount of exercise, type of exercise, basal metabolic rate, how much energy one burns just sitting there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I've talked before on this podcast about NEAT, non-exercise induced thermogenesis, where if people bounce around a lot and fidget a lot, they can burn anywhere from 800 to 2000 calories per day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So their quote unquote basal metabolic rate is actually much higher simply because they're fidgeters, whereas people who tend to be more stationary have a lower basal metabolic rate on average.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a great science to support this metabolic factors and hormones are also very important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Hormones such as thyroid hormone and insulin and growth hormone and the sex story to hormones, testosterone and estrogen, those levels will also profoundly influence the calories out, the calories burned component of the calories in calories out equation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So if out there on the internet or in listening to a particular podcast or speaker, somebody says, this is the ideal diet or calories in calories out does not matter or calories in calories out is the only thing that matters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.940</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's very important to understand that there are some foundational truths such as calories in calories out, but that of course, hormone factors and the context in which a given diet regimen is taking place are exceedingly important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's no way that we can drill into every aspect of a given feeding plan or feeding schedule that would allow us to tap into every aspect of the list that I read out before weight loss, fat loss, muscle, organ, genome, epigenome, inflammation, exercise, cognition, mood, and lifespan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.260</a></span> | <span class="t">But today we're going to be very clear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.260</a></span> | <span class="t">It's very clear from both animal studies and human studies can have a very powerful and positive impact on everything from weight loss and fat loss to various health parameters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=329" target="_blank">00:05:29.260</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a beautiful literature that's emerged mostly in the last 10 or 15 years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=334" target="_blank">00:05:34.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So there is a perfect diet for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And today I'm going to arm you with the mechanisms and understanding that will allow you to define what that perfect diet is and will allow you to eat on a schedule and to eat the things that are going to best serve your goals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Some simple rules about

including fructose from fruit, but also sucrose and glucose and simple sugars will raise your insulin and blood glucose more than complex carbohydrates.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=385" target="_blank">00:06:25.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Things like grains and breads and pastas and so forth and grains and breads and pastas and so forth will raise your blood glucose more than fibrous carbohydrates like lettuce and broccoli and things of that sort.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Protein has a somewhat moderate or modest impact and fat has the lowest impact on raising your blood glucose and blood insulin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So what you eat will impact how steep arise in blood glucose and insulin takes place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=413" target="_blank">00:06:53.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And there are a number of factors that are related to your individual health that will also dictate how steep and how high that rise in glucose and insulin will be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=422" target="_blank">00:07:02.260</a></span> | <span class="t">The longer it's been since your last meal, the lower typically your blood glucose and insulin will be, and the higher things like GLP-1, glucagon like peptide one, glucagon being a hormone that's also secreted when you are in a fasted state or a low blood glucose state.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=444" target="_blank">00:07:24.260</a></span> | <span class="t">It's involved in mobilizing various energy sources from the body, including fat through what we call lipolysis, also using carbohydrates and potentially even using muscle as a source of energy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=456" target="_blank">00:07:36.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's kind of a fire hose of information about what happens when you eat and don't eat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=463" target="_blank">00:07:43.260</a></span> | <span class="t">But just think of it this way, blood sugar and insulin go up when you eat, they go down when you don't eat and other hormones go up when you don't eat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=471" target="_blank">00:07:51.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So there are hormones associated with the fasted state and there are hormones associated with the eating and having just eaten state.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=479" target="_blank">00:07:59.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, the most important thing to understand is that like everything in biology, this is a process that takes time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=489" target="_blank">00:08:09.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So insulin and glucose go up when we eat and it takes some period of time for them to go down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=495" target="_blank">00:08:15.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Even if we stop eating, they will remain up for some period of time and then go back down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=500" target="_blank">00:08:20.260</a></span> | <span class="t">It takes time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=502" target="_blank">00:08:22.260</a></span> | <span class="t">This is very important because if you look at the scientific literature on fasting, on time restriction,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=508" target="_blank">00:08:28.260</a></span> | <span class="t">it's absolutely clear that the health benefits, not just the weight loss benefits, but that the health benefits from time restricted feeding occur because certain conditions are met in the brain and body for a certain amount of time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=526" target="_blank">00:08:46.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And that gives us an anchor from which to view what eating is in terms of how it sets conditions in the body over time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=535" target="_blank">00:08:55.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And if that sounds overly analytic, I promise you, this is the simplest and best way to think about any eating schedule or any eating plan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=544" target="_blank">00:09:04.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think it's fair to say that in the field of nutrition, there are a few landmark studies that serve as really strong anchors for building our understanding of what to eat and what not to eat and when to eat, depending on our goals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=557" target="_blank">00:09:17.260</a></span> | <span class="t">The Garner study that I mentioned earlier is one such study in that it says, if your goal is weight loss, it really does not matter what foods you consume provided that you consume a sub maintenance caloric diet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=573" target="_blank">00:09:33.260</a></span> | <span class="t">However, I want to emphasize again, that sets aside issues of adherence, meaning how easy or hard it is to adhere to a given diet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=582" target="_blank">00:09:42.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Some people find it much easier to follow a high fat, low carbohydrate diet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=586" target="_blank">00:09:46.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Some people fall follow a different diet because it's much easier for them to follow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=590" target="_blank">00:09:50.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And some people are concerned with mental performance and athletic performance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=594" target="_blank">00:09:54.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So that study doesn't say there's a best diet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=597" target="_blank">00:09:57.260</a></span> | <span class="t">What it says is that what you consume is less important than the amount of food that you consume, at least for sake of weight loss, not necessarily for sake of health.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=608" target="_blank">00:10:08.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, the study that I'm going to refer to next is what I would consider the second major pillar of nutritional studies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=616" target="_blank">00:10:16.260</a></span> | <span class="t">This was a paper in mice that set the basis for studies in humans that came later.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=621" target="_blank">00:10:21.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And the title of this paper is time restricted feeding without reducing caloric intake prevents metabolic diseases in mice fed a high fat diet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=630" target="_blank">00:10:30.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So the title tells us a lot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=632" target="_blank">00:10:32.260</a></span> | <span class="t">It says that what's varied in this study is not what these mice ate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=638" target="_blank">00:10:38.260</a></span> | <span class="t">It was when they ate it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=640" target="_blank">00:10:40.260</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the most important things to take away from the study was that mice that ate a highly palatable, high fat diet, a great tasting diet, but only during a restricted feeding window of each 24 hour cycle maintained or lost weight over time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=655" target="_blank">00:10:55.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Whereas mice that ingested the same diet, same amount of calories, but had access to those calories around the clock, gained weight, became obese and quite sick.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=667" target="_blank">00:11:07.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And as an additional second point, the mice that restricted their feeding window to a particular portion of eight hours of every 24 hour cycle actually showed some improvement in important health markers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=682" target="_blank">00:11:22.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And what was even more incredible is that mice that only ate during a particular feeding window also experienced some reversal of some prior negative health effects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=694" target="_blank">00:11:34.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Not only did restricting food to a particular phase of the 24 hour cycle benefit things like lean body mass and fat loss and a number of health parameters that I'll talk about in a moment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=707" target="_blank">00:11:47.260</a></span> | <span class="t">But it also anchored all the gene systems of the body and provided a more regular stable so-called circadian rhythm or 24 hour rhythm.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=716" target="_blank">00:11:56.260</a></span> | <span class="t">You may be surprised to learn that 80%, 80% of the genes in your body and brain are on a 24 hour schedule.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=727" target="_blank">00:12:07.260</a></span> | <span class="t">That is they change their levels going from high to low and back to high again across the 24 hour cycle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=733" target="_blank">00:12:13.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And when those genes are high at the appropriate times and low at the appropriate times, meaning their expression is high and low at the appropriate times.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=742" target="_blank">00:12:22.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And therefore the proper RNAs and proteins are made because DNA encodes for RNA, RNA is translated into proteins.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=750" target="_blank">00:12:30.260</a></span> | <span class="t">When that happens, when those genes are not expressed at the right times, when they're high or low at the wrong times of each 24 hour cycle, that's when you get negative health effects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=763" target="_blank">00:12:43.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And while this was in mice, we now know that this also occurs in humans.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=767" target="_blank">00:12:47.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you want to be healthy, you want your organ health, your metabolic health to be entrained properly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=774" target="_blank">00:12:54.260</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the most important things you can do is to eat at the appropriate time of each 24 hour day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=779" target="_blank">00:12:59.260</a></span> | <span class="t">When mice can eat around the clock, bad things happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=782" target="_blank">00:13:02.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of the bad things that happens is that the liver suffers fatty deposits in the liver, other factors in the liver essentially taking down the pathway of liver disease.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=792" target="_blank">00:13:12.260</a></span> | <span class="t">The time restricted feeding essentially reversed that or led in many cases to even healthier liver condition.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=799" target="_blank">00:13:19.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So restricting your feeding to a particular window every 24 hour cycle has clearly been shown now in mice and in humans to enhance liver health, which is wonderful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=811" target="_blank">00:13:31.260</a></span> | <span class="t">How does it do this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=812" target="_blank">00:13:32.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, it happens because food intake, as I mentioned earlier, sets certain conditions in the body that last for a period of time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=820" target="_blank">00:13:40.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Anytime we eat, there's a period of time that's required for so-called digestion, but also gastric emptying.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=827" target="_blank">00:13:47.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And other processes related to breaking down that food and utilizing it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=832" target="_blank">00:13:52.260</a></span> | <span class="t">That process of breaking down food involves certain cellular functions that if they're ongoing throughout the 24 hour cycle, or even extended too far across the 24 hour cycle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=845" target="_blank">00:14:05.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Meaning you're eating across a 14 or a 16 hour, an 18 hour window that causes serious problems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=851" target="_blank">00:14:11.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So by eating around the clock, you're making yourself sicker.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=854" target="_blank">00:14:14.260</a></span> | <span class="t">By eating at restricted periods of time, each 24 hour day, you're actually making yourself healthier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=859" target="_blank">00:14:19.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And you are activating certain processes that can positively impact both weight, either maintenance or loss of weight and blood glucose regulation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=872" target="_blank">00:14:32.260</a></span> | <span class="t">As we move forward and we talk about intermittent fasting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=875" target="_blank">00:14:35.260</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to start to establish a foundational protocol that all of us, any of us can use in order to maximize your particular goals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=884" target="_blank">00:14:44.260</a></span> | <span class="t">There are some absolutes within this realm of time-restricted feeding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=889" target="_blank">00:14:49.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Here are a couple of absolutes that you would want to consider.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=892" target="_blank">00:14:52.260</a></span> | <span class="t">First of all, it pays off in the metabolic sense and in the health sense and in the weight maintenance or loss sense to not ingest any food in the first hour after waking and potentially for longer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=909" target="_blank">00:15:09.260</a></span> | <span class="t">The second major pillar that's well supported by research is that for the two and ideally three hours prior to bedtime, you also don't ingest any food or liquid calories for that matter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=924" target="_blank">00:15:24.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's deal with this first question of when is the ideal feeding window.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=928" target="_blank">00:15:28.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And here again, we're thinking about a schedule of eating that involves eating at least once every 24 hours, not two day or three day or every other day fast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=937" target="_blank">00:15:37.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So it turns out that the answer to the question, when is it best to eat is actually best answered by thinking about the other side of the coin, which is when is it best to fast?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=948" target="_blank">00:15:48.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So because we are fasting during sleep, it's very clear that it's best to extend the sleep related fast either into the morning or to start it in the evening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=962" target="_blank">00:16:02.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, this might seem kind of obvious, but it's actually not so obvious.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=966" target="_blank">00:16:06.260</a></span> | <span class="t">You could place that feeding window early in the day, middle of the day or late in the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=971" target="_blank">00:16:11.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's think about what happens when we sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=974" target="_blank">00:16:14.260</a></span> | <span class="t">When we sleep, our body undergoes a number of different processes in the brain and body in order to recover the cells and tissues.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=983" target="_blank">00:16:23.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Many of you have probably heard of autophagy, which is essentially a cleaning up a gobbling up of dead cells and cells that are injured or sick.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=991" target="_blank">00:16:31.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is a natural process that occurs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=993" target="_blank">00:16:33.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And it occurs mainly during sleep, although not only during sleep, fasting of any kind does tend to enhance autophagy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1003" target="_blank">00:16:43.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So when we're asleep, the bad cells are getting gobbled up and eaten.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1007" target="_blank">00:16:47.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And the good cells also are undergoing certain repair mechanisms, mainly related to, or at least governed by those circadian genes that we talked about earlier, those clock genes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1017" target="_blank">00:16:57.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So one thing is certain that you want your eating window to be tacked or attached to your sleep-based fasting in a way that makes it easier for you to get into the fasted state for a period of time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1032" target="_blank">00:17:12.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, most people find it very hard to only eat in the middle of the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1036" target="_blank">00:17:16.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So while that's best, it's ideal for sake of the fasting related improvements in health.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1042" target="_blank">00:17:22.260</a></span> | <span class="t">It is not ideal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1043" target="_blank">00:17:23.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's not very applicable to most work and family and social situations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1049" target="_blank">00:17:29.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Most people eat breakfast with others and or eat dinner with others.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1053" target="_blank">00:17:33.260</a></span> | <span class="t">But in general, it's hard to restrict your feeding window to just the absolute middle of the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1058" target="_blank">00:17:38.260</a></span> | <span class="t">But from a purely health perspective, in a very objective way, that would be the ideal situation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1064" target="_blank">00:17:44.260</a></span> | <span class="t">It does appear beneficial to grab a hold of that sleep related fast, meaning you don't want your feeding window to be too close to bedtime.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1076" target="_blank">00:17:56.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's why we came up with this kind of foundational pillar, which is at least no eating for the first hour after waking, but also no eating within two to three hours prior to bed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1087" target="_blank">00:18:07.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So from both a practical and a health perspective and a purely objective view of how intermittent fasting works and can benefit us starting to eat each day somewhere around 10:00 AM or around noon,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1104" target="_blank">00:18:24.260</a></span> | <span class="t">and then allowing a feeding window that goes until six or maybe 8:00 PM.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1110" target="_blank">00:18:30.260</a></span> | <span class="t">That seems to me like the kind of schedule that will allow you to get the most out of intermittent fasting, time-restricted feeding, but does not set you up to be really out of sync with the social rhythms in most cultures.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1125" target="_blank">00:18:45.260</a></span> | <span class="t">If you think about it from the perspective of say a noon to eight feeding window, what you'll find is that you're able to eat lunch with others if you like, or by yourself, you will be able to eat dinner at a reasonable hour,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1139" target="_blank">00:18:59.260</a></span> | <span class="t">at least in most countries in most cultures, eating dinner somewhere between 6:30 and 7:00 PM is typical.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1148" target="_blank">00:19:08.260</a></span> | <span class="t">When you say a feeding window that goes until eight, that doesn't mean sitting down to dinner at eight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1153" target="_blank">00:19:13.260</a></span> | <span class="t">That means your last bite of food or ingestion of any liquid calories was at 8:00 PM.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1158" target="_blank">00:19:18.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Assuming that you go to bed somewhere between 10:00 PM and 1:00 AM, that allows this tapering off or this transition from feeding to a fasted state and still allows you to capitalize on the special period of fasting that is sleep-related fasting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1173" target="_blank">00:19:33.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, I want to emphasize that the fasting that occurs during sleep is vital and eating too close to sleep will disrupt that fasting-related sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1182" target="_blank">00:19:42.260</a></span> | <span class="t">The important thing here is to establish a feeding window that you can comfortably manage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1187" target="_blank">00:19:47.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1187" target="_blank">00:19:47.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Meaning that on average, you can obey an eight hour feeding window or a 10 hour feeding window, and then to place that feeding window in a social and life context that you can manage on a regular basis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1200" target="_blank">00:20:00.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Now there are two key points that have been gleaned from the scientific data about this feeding window and when to place it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1207" target="_blank">00:20:07.260</a></span> | <span class="t">First of all, we can say is that the seven to nine hour feeding window produces all of the major health benefits of time-restricted feeding, as well as being pretty straightforward for most people to adhere to on a regular basis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1222" target="_blank">00:20:22.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And on a regular basis turns out to be very important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1224" target="_blank">00:20:24.260</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll get back to that point in a moment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1225" target="_blank">00:20:25.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Whereas the four to six hour eating window doesn't seem to serve people as well as say a seven or eight hour eating window simply because people are overeating during that eating window.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1235" target="_blank">00:20:35.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's talk about some conditions where having the feeding window early in the day would actually be very beneficial.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1241" target="_blank">00:20:41.260</a></span> | <span class="t">If your main interest is maintaining and or building muscle, then it can be beneficial to ingest protein early in the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1249" target="_blank">00:20:49.260</a></span> | <span class="t">You would still want to obey this, what we're calling a kind of foundational rule of not eating any food for the first hour post waking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1259" target="_blank">00:20:59.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And the cutoff for when you would want to eat protein would be sometime before 10:00 AM.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1265" target="_blank">00:21:05.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And there I'm averaging across a number of different situations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1269" target="_blank">00:21:09.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Now it's not as if at 10:01 AM a gate slammed shut and you can't generate hypertrophy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1275" target="_blank">00:21:15.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Of course, that's not the case.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1277" target="_blank">00:21:17.260</a></span> | <span class="t">However, it's very interesting that it doesn't matter when the resistance training, the load bearing exercise occurs in the 24 hour cycle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1285" target="_blank">00:21:25.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So whether or not, in other words, people are training early in the day or they're training late in the day, it still appears that ingesting protein early in the day favors hypertrophy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1296" target="_blank">00:21:36.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So obviously we don't want to be overly neurotic about this stuff, but because this is an episode about the science of intermittent fasting and time-restricted feeding, as important as how long your feeding window is, is where that feeding window resides in each 24 hour cycle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1314" target="_blank">00:21:54.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And perhaps even more important than that is that it be fairly regular where that feeding window resides, because even if you have a very short feeding window, if it's drifting around from day to day, that actually offsets a number of the positive health effects of intermittent fasting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1330" target="_blank">00:22:10.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Along those lines, however, there are things that we can all do that will allow us to offset some of the drift, if you will, that we experience or that we induce in terms of when our feeding window occurs, or that the feeding window might push out a little later and then therefore start a little later the next day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1350" target="_blank">00:22:30.260</a></span> | <span class="t">There are things that we can do, and there are things that we can take.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1352" target="_blank">00:22:32.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I'd like to discuss those briefly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1354" target="_blank">00:22:34.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So throughout this episode, I've more or less been alluding to the fact that when you eat, there's some period of time afterwards in which you're actually still eating, at least from the perspective of metabolism, because glucose is up, insulin is up, and you're undergoing different metabolic and digestive processes that don't really speak to you being in a fasted state, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1377" target="_blank">00:22:57.260</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not just about when you take your last bite or your last sip.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1382" target="_blank">00:23:02.260</a></span> | <span class="t">However, there are things that we can do to accelerate the transition from a fed state to a fasted state.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1392" target="_blank">00:23:12.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I'd like to discuss what those are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1394" target="_blank">00:23:14.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's a fun and exciting concept, which is glucose clearing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1397" target="_blank">00:23:17.260</a></span> | <span class="t">You may have heard the old adage that if you take a 20 or 30 minute walk after dinner, that it accelerates the rate at which you digest that food.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1406" target="_blank">00:23:26.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And indeed it does.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1407" target="_blank">00:23:27.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So for instance, if you were to eat a meal that ended at 8:00 PM and then plopped to the couch, it would be five or six hours until you have transitioned from a fed state to a fasted state.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1422" target="_blank">00:23:42.260</a></span> | <span class="t">However, you can accelerate that considerably by taking a 20 or 30 minute, just light walk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1428" target="_blank">00:23:48.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And this gets back to this key feature of our biology, which is that what we eat, when we eat, when we exercise, when we view light, it's about setting a context or a set of conditions in your brain and body.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1441" target="_blank">00:24:01.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's not so much about the activities that you undergo.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1444" target="_blank">00:24:04.260</a></span> | <span class="t">It's about the activities you undergo and their relationship to one another over time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1449" target="_blank">00:24:09.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And so in this way, it really beautifully highlights the way that your biology is interacting all the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1455" target="_blank">00:24:15.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Now there are other ways to clear out blood glucose that involve supplements or prescription drugs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1462" target="_blank">00:24:22.260</a></span> | <span class="t">These are so-called glucose disposal agents, glucose disposal agents, such as metformin, which is a prescription drug or berberine, which is an over-the-counter substance will lead to very dramatic reductions in blood glucose.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1477" target="_blank">00:24:37.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Now I've tried berberine before, and what I can tell you is that if you take berberine, which by the way is very much like metformin, its effects are almost identical to metformin in fact, but it's much less expensive and it's over the counter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1489" target="_blank">00:24:49.260</a></span> | <span class="t">If you take berberine and you have not ingested carbohydrates, many people, including myself, experience a splitting headache.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1497" target="_blank">00:24:57.260</a></span> | <span class="t">You become hypoglycemic because it is a glucose clearing agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1501" target="_blank">00:25:01.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Nowadays, there are a number of commercially available continuous glucose monitors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1506" target="_blank">00:25:06.260</a></span> | <span class="t">I've tried one of these.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1507" target="_blank">00:25:07.260</a></span> | <span class="t">It involves putting what's essentially a patch with a little needle that goes into your skin, which is continuing continually, excuse me, monitoring your blood glucose.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1515" target="_blank">00:25:15.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can look at it at an app on your phone and you can learn a lot that way about how different foods impact the increases and decrease in blood glucose.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1523" target="_blank">00:25:23.260</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're doing experiments with berberine or metformin, you can see how those impact your blood glucose.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1528" target="_blank">00:25:28.260</a></span> | <span class="t">You can see how exercise hit training or otherwise in black impacts blood glucose.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1533" target="_blank">00:25:33.260</a></span> | <span class="t">glucose, excuse me again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1534" target="_blank">00:25:34.260</a></span> | <span class="t">I have to say that glucose clearing agents that involve a walk or exercise moderate or intense are going to be a lot easier to titrate and adjust the levels of than things that you're going to take where you have to ingest the dosage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1549" target="_blank">00:25:49.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And then once you ingest a certain dosage, you're along for the ride, at least until the effects of that particular compound wear off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1555" target="_blank">00:25:55.260</a></span> | <span class="t">In the fasted state, a number of different proteins that are expressed in cells undergo changes in their expression.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1562" target="_blank">00:26:02.260</a></span> | <span class="t">When we are fasted, we tend to reduce the activity of a particular protein called mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1571" target="_blank">00:26:11.260</a></span> | <span class="t">MTOR is very active in cells while they are growing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1575" target="_blank">00:26:15.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So one way I'd like you to think about the fed state is that when you eat or when you don't eat, when you're fed, when you're fasted, you are either promoting cellular growth of all kinds, or you're promoting cellular repair and clearance of all kinds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1589" target="_blank">00:26:29.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And so again, this is about setting conditions in the brain and body.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1593" target="_blank">00:26:33.260</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not so much about when you eat food A or B, it leads to increases in mTOR.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1599" target="_blank">00:26:39.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Anytime you eat any food, doesn't matter if it's plant-based, animal-based, fat, protein, carbohydrate, doesn't matter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1606" target="_blank">00:26:46.260</a></span> | <span class="t">You are biasing your system towards a biochemical state of cell growth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1610" target="_blank">00:26:50.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And anytime you haven't eaten for a while or blood glucose is low, you're biasing your system toward a state of cellular repair.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1618" target="_blank">00:26:58.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is why people who do not suffer from any blood glucose regulation issues take things like berberine as glucose disposal agents or take metformin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1628"

transition into it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1753" target="_blank">00:29:13.260</a></span> | <span class="t">not just going

eight-hour time-restricted feeding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1822" target="_blank">00:30:22.260</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:30:31.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Somehow just by adhering to an eight-hour window, they are taking in fewer calories than they're burning off.</span></div><div class="c"><span

others involving the eight-hour feeding window also in humans,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1848" target="_blank">00:30:48.260</a></span> | <span class="t">but because the eight-hour feeding window has been tested in obese adults and non-obese adults.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1853" target="_blank">00:30:53.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And there are even a few studies in children.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1855" target="_blank">00:30:55.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So this eight-hour window seems to be a really good rule of thumb and a kind of anchor around which we can each think about incorporating time-restricted feeding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=1864"

sliding around on the weekend so that it's starting two hours later and ending two hours later a couple days a week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

sides.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=2168" target="_blank">00:36:08.260</a></span> | <span class="t">You would place it smack dab in the middle of the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=2172" target="_blank">00:36:12.260</a></span> | <span class="t">It would be a schedule in which you started eating, for instance, at 10:00 AM and you stopped eating at 6:00 PM.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=2180" target="_blank">00:36:20.260</a></span> | <span class="t">An absolutely dreadful schedule for anyone that wants to have some semblance of a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=2197" target="_blank">00:36:37.260</a></span> | <span class="t">For instance, I like to exercise early in the day if I run or if I do some moderate or light intensity exercise, regardless of what type of exercise it is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=2206"

run sprints and I do that at 7:00 AM or 8:00 AM by 11:00 AM, I am very, very hungry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=2222"

hypertrophy or maintenance of muscle, then it does seem that ingesting protein early in the day is beneficial.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

prefer to be fasting, that's when a 30-minute brisk walk or even modest walk after eating can be beneficial.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

those with the appropriate level of caution and figure out the dosages for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D61jJJPIQeo&t=2274"
