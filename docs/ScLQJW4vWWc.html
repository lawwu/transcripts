Is that right? In my book, The Family Farm, I talk about the idea of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScLQJW4vWWc&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">a decision framework, which I think is helpful for bigger decisions in particular.

No. It's just about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScLQJW4vWWc&t=3068" target="_blank">00:51:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">setting boundaries and figuring out where does that fit in your family life and how do you leave</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScLQJW4vWWc&t=3072" target="_blank">00:51:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">enough time for the other things that you want your kid to be doing.

When we talk about phones, then you introduce another set of issues. One is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScLQJW4vWWc&t=3084" target="_blank">00:51:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">it's actually very hard to set boundaries with phones.
