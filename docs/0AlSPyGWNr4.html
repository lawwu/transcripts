And today we have a very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=5" target="_blank">00:00:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">exciting guest, which we will introduce in a second. But before we do that, we'll do brief</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=9" target="_blank">00:00:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">introductions and then one announcement. So first we'll go to Bob and then we'll go to Adam who has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=13" target="_blank">00:00:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the one announcement. And then we will introduce our guest. I'm Bob Terrio. I'm a J enthusiast</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=18" target="_blank">00:00:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and I do some work with the J Wiki. We're underway and trying to get it all set up for the fall.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=24" target="_blank">00:00:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm Adam Botzewski, full-time APL programmer at Dialog Limited. Besides for actually programming</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=30" target="_blank">00:00:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">APL, I also take care of all kinds of social things, including the APL Wiki. And then for my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=37" target="_blank">00:00:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">announcements, part of what we do with Dialog is arrange a yearly user meeting or a type of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=42" target="_blank">00:00:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">conference. And at that user meeting, there is also a presentation by the winner of the APL</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=51" target="_blank">00:00:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">problem solving competition. That competition closes at the end of the month. So hurry up if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=59" target="_blank">00:00:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">you want to participate. It's not too late even to get started at this point. And also at the end of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=63" target="_blank">00:01:03.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the month is the end of the early bird discount for the user meeting itself. Awesome. And just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=70" target="_blank">00:01:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">a note about that contest. I think, and Adam can correct me if I'm wrong, there's two phases in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=75" target="_blank">00:01:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the first phase. It's just 10 short problems. A lot of them are just one-liners. And even if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=80" target="_blank">00:01:20.560</a></span> | <span class="t">you only solve one of the 10, I think you can win a small cash prize just from answering one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=86" target="_blank">00:01:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Is that correct? I'm not even sure. You might need to solve them all. They're really easy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=96" target="_blank">00:01:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So the point being though is that you don't need to complete the whole contest in order to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=99" target="_blank">00:01:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">eligible to win prizes.

Yeah, so I actually started at McKinsey. I grew up in Melbourne, Australia. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=328" target="_blank">00:05:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I didn't know what I wanted to do when I grew up at the point that you're meant to know when you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=334" target="_blank">00:05:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">choose a university, you know, major. So I picked philosophy on the basis that it was like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, the best way of punting down the road what you might do, because with philosophy,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=345" target="_blank">00:05:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">you can't do anything. And honestly, that kind of worked out in that I needed money,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and I needed money to get through university. So I got over like one day a week, kind of IT</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">support job at McKinsey, the McKinsey Melbourne office during university from first year,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=367" target="_blank">00:06:07.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that's from first year. But it turned out that like, yeah, I was very curious, and so I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=375" target="_blank">00:06:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">so curious about management consulting. So every time consultants would come down and ask me to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=378" target="_blank">00:06:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">like, you know, clean out the sticky coke they built in their keyboard or whatever, I would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">always ask them what they were working on and ask them to show me and I've been really interested in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=391" target="_blank">00:06:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">like doing analytics see kind of things for a few years at that point. So during high school,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=398" target="_blank">00:06:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">basically every holidays, I kind of worked on stuff with spreadsheets or Microsoft access or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=404" target="_blank">00:06:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">whatever. So it turned out I knew more about like, stuff like Microsoft Excel than they did. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">within about two months of me starting this one day a week job, I was working 90 hour weeks,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=417" target="_blank">00:06:57.120</a></span> | <span class="t">basically doing analytical work for the consultants. And so that, you know, that actually worked out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=425" target="_blank">00:07:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">really well, because I kind of did a deal with them where they would, they gave me a full time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=431" target="_blank">00:07:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">office, and they would pay me $50 an hour for whatever time I needed. And so suddenly, I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=437" target="_blank">00:07:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">actually making a lot of money, you know, working, working 90 hours a week. And yeah, it was great</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=448" target="_blank">00:07:28.560</a></span> | <span class="t">because then the I would come up with these solutions to things they're doing in the projects,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=453" target="_blank">00:07:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and I'd have to present it to the client. So next thing I knew I was basically on the client side</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=457" target="_blank">00:07:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">or all the time. So I ended up actually not going to any lectures at university. And I somehow kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=465" target="_blank">00:07:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">of managed this thing where I would take two weeks off before each exam, go and talk to all my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=470" target="_blank">00:07:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">lecturers and say, Hey, I was meant to be in your university course. I know you didn't see me, but I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=475" target="_blank">00:07:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">was kind of busy. Can you tell me what I was meant to have done? And I would do it. And so I kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=481" target="_blank">00:08:01.440</a></span> | <span class="t">scraped by a BA in philosophy, but I don't Yeah, you know, I don't really have much of an academic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=488" target="_blank">00:08:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">background. But that did give me a great background in like applying stuff like, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=495" target="_blank">00:08:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">linear regression and logistic regression and linear programming and, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=499" target="_blank">00:08:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the basic analytical tools of the day, generally through VBA scripts in Excel, or, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=507" target="_blank">00:08:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">access, you know, the kind of stuff that a consultant could chuck out, you know, on to their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=512" target="_blank">00:08:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">laptop at a client site. Anyway, I always felt guilty about doing that, because it just seemed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=520" target="_blank">00:08:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">like this ridiculously nerdy thing to be doing when I was surrounded by all these very important,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=526" target="_blank">00:08:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, consultant types who seemed to be doing much more impressive strategy work. So I tried to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=533" target="_blank">00:08:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">get away from that as quickly as I could, because I didn't want to be the nerd in the company. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=540" target="_blank">00:09:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah, so I ended up spending the next 10 years basically doing strategy consulting. But throughout</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=546" target="_blank">00:09:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that time, I did, you know, because I didn't have the same background that they did that expertise,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=552" target="_blank">00:09:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">they did the MBA, they did, I had to solve things using data and analytically intensive approaches.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=558" target="_blank">00:09:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So although in theory, I was a strategy management consultant, and I was working on problems like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=563" target="_blank">00:09:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, how do we fix the rice industry in Australia? Or, you know, how do we, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=569" target="_blank">00:09:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">like, you know, how do we deal with this new competitor coming into this industry or whatever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=573" target="_blank">00:09:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">it was, I always did it by analyzing data, which actually turned out to be a good niche, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=580" target="_blank">00:09:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">because I was the one McKinsey consultant in Australia who did things that way. And so I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=584" target="_blank">00:09:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">successful and I became I think, I ended up moving to AT Carney, which is the other of the two</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=590" target="_blank">00:09:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">original management consulting firms.

And then through that, learned about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=603" target="_blank">00:10:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the insurance industry and discovered like the whole insurance industry is basically pricing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=609" target="_blank">00:10:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">things in a really dumb way. I developed this approach based on optimization of optimized</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=617" target="_blank">00:10:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">pricing, launched a company with my university friend who had a PhD in operations research.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=625" target="_blank">00:10:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And, yeah, so we built this new approach to pricing insurance, which is, it was kind of fun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=634" target="_blank">00:10:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, it's, you know, it went well in the set, you know, commercially took a bit of about 10</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=641" target="_blank">00:10:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">years doing doing that. And at the same time, running an email company called fast mail,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=646" target="_blank">00:10:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">which also went well. Yeah, we started out basically using C++. And I would say that was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=655" target="_blank">00:10:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of the start of my array programming journey in that in those days, this is like 1999,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=660" target="_blank">00:11:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the very first expression templates based approaches to C++ numeric programming were appearing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=667" target="_blank">00:11:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I, you know, was talking to the people working on those libraries doing stuff like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=674" target="_blank">00:11:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">particularly stuff doing the big kind of high energy physics experiments that were going on in Europe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=681" target="_blank">00:11:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">It was ultimately pretty annoying to work with, though, like the amount of time it talked to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=688" target="_blank">00:11:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">compile those things, it would take hours.

And so at the time, Perl 6,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=781" target="_blank">00:13:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, we was just starting to the idea of it was being developed.

Perl 6 never exactly happened.

And so after I sold those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=887" target="_blank">00:14:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">companies, yeah, I, one of the things I decided to do was to try actually to become more competent,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=896" target="_blank">00:14:56.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, I had lost my, to some extent, I had lost my feeling that I should hide my nerdiness,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=906" target="_blank">00:15:06.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, and try to act like a real business person.

So I tried entering a machine learning competition</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=918" target="_blank">00:15:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">at a new company that had just been launched called Kaggle with this goal of like, not coming last.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=926" target="_blank">00:15:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So basically, the, you know, the way these things work is you have to make predictions on a data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=937" target="_blank">00:15:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">set.

So it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=963" target="_blank">00:16:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">felt like a high bar.

Because,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=972" target="_blank">00:16:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah, it was like, oh, okay, I am, you know, empirically good at this thing. And people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=983" target="_blank">00:16:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">at my local user groups, we used quite a bit as well.

I just used common sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1007" target="_blank">00:16:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so I ended up becoming the chief scientist and president of Kaggle.

And that was great. That was like, I just dove in, we moved to San Francisco for 10</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1031" target="_blank">00:17:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">years.

And I always felt like neural networks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1106" target="_blank">00:18:26.720</a></span> | <span class="t">were one day going to be the thing. It's like, you know, they are at a theoretical level,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1114" target="_blank">00:18:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">infinitely capable. But, you know, they never quite did it for me. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1121" target="_blank">00:18:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">but then in 2012, suddenly, neural networks started achieving superhuman performance for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1129" target="_blank">00:18:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the first time on really challenging problems, like recognizing traffic signs, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1134" target="_blank">00:18:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">like recognizing pictures. And I'd always said to myself, I was going to watch for this moment,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1140" target="_blank">00:19:00.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and when it happened, I wanted to like, jump on it. So as soon as I saw that, I tried to jump on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1144" target="_blank">00:19:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">it. So I started a new company, after a year of research into like the, you know, what what a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1152" target="_blank">00:19:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">neural network's going to do, I decided medicine was going to be huge, I need nothing about medicine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1158" target="_blank">00:19:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And I, yeah, I started a medicine company to see what we could do with deep learning in medicine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1163" target="_blank">00:19:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So that was analytic. Yeah, that ended up going pretty well. And yeah, eventually, I kind of got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1173" target="_blank">00:19:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">like a bit frustrated with that, though, because it felt like big learning can do so many things,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1179" target="_blank">00:19:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and I'm only doing such a small part of those things. So deep learning is like neural networks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1184" target="_blank">00:19:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">with multiple layers. I thought the only way to actually help people really, you know, make the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1191" target="_blank">00:19:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">most of this incredibly valuable technology is to teach other people how to do it, and to help</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1196" target="_blank">00:19:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">other people to do it. So my wife and I ended up studying a new, I'd call it kind of a research</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1202" target="_blank">00:20:02.560</a></span> | <span class="t">lab, fast AI, to, to help, to help do that, basically, initially focus on education,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1209" target="_blank">00:20:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and then increasingly focus on research and software development to basically make it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1215" target="_blank">00:20:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">easier for folks to use some deep learning.

And that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1223" target="_blank">00:20:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">everything in deep learning is all Python. And in Python, we're very lucky to have,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1230" target="_blank">00:20:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, excellent libraries that behave pretty consistently with each other,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1236" target="_blank">00:20:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">basically based around this NumPy library, which treats arrays very, very similarly to how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1245" target="_blank">00:20:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Jay does, except rather than leading access, it's trailing access.

All right, so where do we start now with the questions?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1295" target="_blank">00:21:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll let Bob and Adam go first if they want.

Because when I was going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1309" target="_blank">00:21:49.360</a></span> | <span class="t">university all those years ago, people were talking about neural networks, and then they just sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1314" target="_blank">00:21:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">dropped off the face. And as you said, around 2010, suddenly they resurfaced again. What do you think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1319" target="_blank">00:21:59.520</a></span> | <span class="t">was the cause of that resurfacing? Was it hardware? Was it somebody discovered a new method or what?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1324" target="_blank">00:22:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, mainly hardware. So what happened was people figured out how to do GP GPU, so general purpose</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1332" target="_blank">00:22:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">GPU computing. So before that, I tried a few times to use GPUs with neural nets, I felt like that would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1338" target="_blank">00:22:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">be the thing. But GPUs were all about like creating shaders and whatever. And it was a whole jargon</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1345" target="_blank">00:22:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">thing. I didn't even understand what was going on. So the key thing was in video coming up with this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1351" target="_blank">00:22:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">CUDA approach, which it's it's all loops, right? But it's much easier than the old way, like the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1362" target="_blank">00:22:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">loops, you basically, it's kind of loops, at least you basically say to CUDA, this is my kernel,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1368" target="_blank">00:22:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">which is the piece of code I want to basically run on each symmetric multiprocessing unit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1372" target="_blank">00:22:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you basically say launch a bunch of threads. And it's going to call your kernel,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1380" target="_blank">00:23:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, basically incrementing the x and y coordinates and passing it to your kernel,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1386" target="_blank">00:23:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">making them available to your kernel. So it's a kind of it's not exactly a loop,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1389" target="_blank">00:23:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">but it's this gets more like a map, I guess. And so when CUDA appeared, yeah, very quickly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1396" target="_blank">00:23:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">neural network libraries appear to take advantage appear appeared that would take advantage of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1401" target="_blank">00:23:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And then suddenly, you know, you get orders of magnitude more performance. And it's cheaper.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1408" target="_blank">00:23:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And you get to buy an Nvidia graphics card with a free copy of Batman, you know, on the excuse that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1414" target="_blank">00:23:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">actually this is all for work. So it was it was mainly that there's also this just like at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1421" target="_blank">00:23:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">same time, the thing I'd been doing for 25 years, suddenly got a name data science, you know, we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1429" target="_blank">00:23:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">like this very small industry of people like applying data driven approaches to solving</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1434" target="_blank">00:23:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">business problems. And we were always looking for a name. Not many people know this, but back in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1440" target="_blank">00:24:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">very early days, there was an attempt to calling it industrial mathematics. Sometimes people would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1446" target="_blank">00:24:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">like shoehorn it into operations research or management science, but that was almost exclusively</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1451" target="_blank">00:24:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">optimization people and specifically people focused more on linear programming approaches.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1457" target="_blank">00:24:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So yeah, once data science appeared, and also like, you know, basically every company had</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1463" target="_blank">00:24:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">finally built their data warehouse and the data was was there. So yeah, it's like more awareness</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1472" target="_blank">00:24:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">of using data to solve business problems and for the first time availability of the hardware that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1477" target="_blank">00:24:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">we actually needed. And as I say, in 2012, it just it's it reached the point like it been growing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1484" target="_blank">00:24:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">since the first neural network was built in was at 1957, I guess, that this kind of gradual</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1493" target="_blank">00:24:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">rate, but once it passed human performance on some tasks, it just kept going. And so now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1500" target="_blank">00:25:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">in the last couple of months, you know, it's now like getting decent marks on MIT math tests and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1508" target="_blank">00:25:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">stuff. It's it's, it's on an amazing trajectory. Yeah, it's kind of a critical mass kind of thing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1516" target="_blank">00:25:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you get a certain amount of information and able to process and information it, I guess, as you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1522" target="_blank">00:25:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">as you do with your hand, it's an exponential curve. And humans and exponential curves,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1528" target="_blank">00:25:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I think we're finding over and over again, we're not really great at understanding an exponential.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1534" target="_blank">00:25:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">No, no, we're not. And that's like why I promised myself that as soon as I saw neural net starting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1541" target="_blank">00:25:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">to look like they're doing interesting things, I would drop everything and jump on it, because I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1545" target="_blank">00:25:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">wanted to jump on that curve as early as possible. And we're now in this situation where people are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1550" target="_blank">00:25:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">just making huge amounts of money with neural nets, which they then reinvest back into making the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1557" target="_blank">00:25:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">neural nets better. And so we are also seeing this kind of bifurcation of capabilities where there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1563" target="_blank">00:26:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">a small number of organizations who are extremely good at this stuff and invested in it and a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1569" target="_blank">00:26:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">of organizations that are, you know, really struggling to figure it out. And because of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1577" target="_blank">00:26:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">exponential nature, when it happens, it happens very quickly, it feels like you didn't see it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1582" target="_blank">00:26:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">coming. And suddenly, it's there. And then it was past you. And I think you're all experiencing that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1586" target="_blank">00:26:26.720</a></span> | <span class="t">now. Yeah, and it's happened in so many industries, you know, back in my medical startup, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1594" target="_blank">00:26:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">we were interviewing folks around medicines, we interviewed a guy finishing his PhD in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1602" target="_blank">00:26:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">histopathology. And I remember, you know, he came in to do an interview with us. And he basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1609" target="_blank">00:26:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">gave us a presentation about his thesis on kind of graph cut segmentation approaches for pathology</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1614" target="_blank">00:26:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">slides. And at the end, he was like, anyway, that was my PhD. And then yesterday, because I knew I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1619" target="_blank">00:26:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">was coming to see you guys, and I heard you like neural nets, I just thought I'd check out neural nets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1624" target="_blank">00:27:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And about four hours later, I trained a neural net to do the same thing I did for my PhD. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1631" target="_blank">00:27:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">way outperformed my PhD thesis, I'd spent the last five years on and so that's where I'm at, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1637" target="_blank">00:27:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and we hear this a lot.

Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1644" target="_blank">00:27:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So I kind of have, I don't know, this is like a 1A, B and C. And I'm not sure if I should ask them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1654" target="_blank">00:27:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">all at once. But so you said sort of at the tail end of the 90s is when your array language journey</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1660" target="_blank">00:27:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">started. But it seems from the way you explained it that you had already at some point along the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1665" target="_blank">00:27:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">way heard about the array languages, APL and J, and have sort of alluded to, you know, picking up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1672" target="_blank">00:27:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">some knowledge about the paradigm and the languages. So my first part of the question is sort of,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1678" target="_blank">00:27:58.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, at what point were you exposed to the paradigm in these languages? The second part is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1684" target="_blank">00:28:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">what's causing you in 2022 to really dive into it? Because you said you feel like maybe a bit of an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1691" target="_blank">00:28:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">imposter or the least qualified guest, which probably is you just being very modest. I'm sure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1696" target="_blank">00:28:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">you know still quite a bit. And then the third part is, do you have thoughts about, and I've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1701" target="_blank">00:28:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">always sort of wondered, how the array language paradigm sort of missed out on like, and Python</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1708" target="_blank">00:28:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">ended up being the main data science language, while like there's like an article that's floating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1714" target="_blank">00:28:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">around online called NumPy, the ghost of Iverson, which it's this sort of you can see that in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1720" target="_blank">00:28:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">names and the design of the library that there is an core of APL and even the documentation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1725" target="_blank">00:28:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">acknowledges that it took inspiration greatly from J and APL. But that like the array languages clearly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1733" target="_blank">00:28:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">missed what was a golden opportunity for their paradigm. And we ended up with libraries and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1740" target="_blank">00:29:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">other languages. So I just asked three questions at once. Feel free to tackle them in any order.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1744" target="_blank">00:29:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I have a pretty bad memory. So I think I've forgotten the second one already. So you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1749" target="_blank">00:29:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">feel free to come back to any or all of them. So my journey, which is what you started with,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1758" target="_blank">00:29:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">was I always felt like we should do more stuff without using code. Because I, or at least like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1771" target="_blank">00:29:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of traditional, what I guess we'd call nowadays, imperative code. There was a couple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1778" target="_blank">00:29:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">of tools in my early days, which I've got huge amounts of leverage from because nobody else</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1785" target="_blank">00:29:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">in at least the consulting firms or generally in our clients knew about them. So that was SQL and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1792" target="_blank">00:29:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">pivot tables. And so pivot tables, if you haven't come across it, was basically one of the earliest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1798" target="_blank">00:29:58.240</a></span> | <span class="t">approaches to OLAP, you know, slicing and dicing. There was actually something slightly earlier</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1802" target="_blank">00:30:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">called Lotus Improv, but that was actually a separate product. Excel was basically the first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1807" target="_blank">00:30:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">one to put OLAP in the spreadsheet. So no loops. You just drag and drop the things you want to group</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1812" target="_blank">00:30:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">by and you right click to choose how to summarize. And same with SQL, you know, you declaratively</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1819" target="_blank">00:30:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">say what you want to do. You don't have to loop through things. SAS actually had something similar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1825" target="_blank">00:30:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, with SAS, you could basically declare a prop that would run on your data. So yeah, I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1832" target="_blank">00:30:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of felt like this was the way I would rather do stuff if I could. And I think that's what led</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1839" target="_blank">00:30:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">me when we started doing the C++ implementation of the insurance pricing stuff of being much more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1846" target="_blank">00:30:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">drawn to these metaprogramming approaches. I just didn't want to be writing loops in loops and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1855" target="_blank">00:30:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">dealing with all that stuff.

Then yeah, so I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1874" target="_blank">00:31:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">when as soon as I saw NumPy had reached a level of some reasonable</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1882" target="_blank">00:31:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">confidence in Python, I was very drawn to that because it was what I've been looking for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1888" target="_blank">00:31:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think maybe that actually is going to bring us to answering the question of like what happened</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=1892" target="_blank">00:31:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">for array languages.

As recently as last week, I heard it described in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=2519" target="_blank">00:41:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">a chat room, it's like people obviously don't care about performance because they're using Python.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=2524" target="_blank">00:42:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's like, well, a large amount of the world's highest performance computing now is done with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=2530" target="_blank">00:42:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Python. It's not because Python's fast, but if you want to use RAPIDS, for example, which literally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=2539" target="_blank">00:42:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">holds records for the highest performance recommendation systems and tabular analysis,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=2546" target="_blank">00:42:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you write it in Python. So this idea of having a fast kernel that's not written in the language</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=2558" target="_blank">00:42:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and then something else talking to it in a very flexible way, I think is great. And as I say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=2563" target="_blank">00:42:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">at the moment, we are very hamstrung in a lot of ways that we, at least until recently, we very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=2568" target="_blank">00:42:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">heavily relied on BLAS, which is totally the wrong thing for that kind of flexible high-performance</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=2577" target="_blank">00:42:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">computing because it's this bunch of somewhat arbitrary kind of selection of linear algebra</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=2585" target="_blank">00:43:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">algorithms, which, you know, things like the C# work I did, you know, they were just RAPIDS on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=2591" target="_blank">00:43:11.120</a></span> | <span class="t">top of BLAS. And what we really want is a way to write really expressive kernels that can do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=2598" target="_blank">00:43:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">anything over any axes. So then there are other newer approaches like Julia, for example, which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=2611" target="_blank">00:43:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">is kind of like got some rispy elements to it and this type dispatch system. But because it's,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=2616" target="_blank">00:43:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, in the end, it's on top of LLVM. What you write in Julia, you know, it does end up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=2625" target="_blank">00:43:45.840</a></span> | <span class="t">getting optimized very well. And you can write pretty much arbitrary kernels in Julia and often</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=2632" target="_blank">00:43:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">get best-in-class performance. And then there's other approaches like JAX. And JAX sits on top</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=2642" target="_blank">00:44:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">of something totally different, which is it sits on top of XLA. And XLA is a compiler, which is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=2649" target="_blank">00:44:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">mainly designed to compile things to run fast on Google's TPUs. But it also does an okay job of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=2657" target="_blank">00:44:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">compiling things to run on GPUs. And then really excitingly, I think, you know, for me is the MLIR</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=2666" target="_blank">00:44:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">project, and particularly the affine dialect. So that was created by my friend, Chris Latner,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=2674" target="_blank">00:44:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">who you probably know from creating Clang and LLVM and Swift. So he joined Google for a couple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=2685" target="_blank">00:44:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">of years. And we worked really closely together on trying to like, think about the vision of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=2689" target="_blank">00:44:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">really powerful programming on accelerators that's really developer friendly. Unfortunately,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=2698" target="_blank">00:44:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">didn't work out.

And I do think there's, you know, if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=2709" target="_blank">00:45:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">something like APO, you know, could target MLIR and then become a DSL inside Python, it may yet win,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=2718" target="_blank">00:45:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you know.

And so JAX is something which,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=2906" target="_blank">00:48:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">instead of turning our line of Python code into a call to some pre-written operation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=2912" target="_blank">00:48:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">it instead is turning it into something that's going to be read by a compiler. And so the compiler</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=2917" target="_blank">00:48:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">can then, you know, optimize that as compilers do. So, yeah, I would guess that JAX probably has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=2926" target="_blank">00:48:46.560</a></span> | <span class="t">a part to play here, particularly because you get to benefit from the whole Python ecosystem,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=2934" target="_blank">00:48:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">package management, libraries, you know, visualization tools, et cetera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=2944" target="_blank">00:49:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, longer term, it's a mess, you know, it's a mess using a language like Python which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=2950" target="_blank">00:49:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">wasn't designed for this. It wasn't really even designed as something that you can chuck</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=2956" target="_blank">00:49:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">different compilers onto. So people put horrible hacks. So, for example, PyTorch,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=2961" target="_blank">00:49:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">they have something called TorchScript, which is a bit similar. It takes Python and kind of compiles</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=2966" target="_blank">00:49:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">it. But they literally wrote their own parser using a bunch of regular expressions. And it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=2974" target="_blank">00:49:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">it's, you know, it's not very good at what it does. It even misreads comments and stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=2979" target="_blank">00:49:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, I do think there's definitely room for, you know, a language of which Julia would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=2987" target="_blank">00:49:47.520</a></span> | <span class="t">certainly be the leading contender at the moment to come in and do it properly. And Julia's got,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=2994" target="_blank">00:49:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, Julia is written on a scheme basis. So there's this little scheme kernel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3001" target="_blank">00:50:01.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that does the parsing and whatnot. And then pretty much everything else after that is written in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3006" target="_blank">00:50:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Julia. And, of course, leveraging LLVM very heavily. But I think that's what we want, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3014" target="_blank">00:50:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Is that something which I guess I didn't love about Swift. When the team at Google wanted to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3019" target="_blank">00:50:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">add differentiation support into Swift, they wrote it in C++. And I was just like, that's not a good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3026" target="_blank">00:50:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">sign. You know, like, apart from anything else, you end up with this group of developers who are,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3035" target="_blank">00:50:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">in theory, Swift experts, but they actually write everything in C++. And so they actually don't have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3040" target="_blank">00:50:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">much feel for what it's like to write stuff in Swift. They're writing stuff for Swift. And Julia,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3045" target="_blank">00:50:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">pretty much everybody who's writing stuff for Julia is writing stuff in Julia. And I think that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3052" target="_blank">00:50:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">something you guys have talked about around APL and J as well, is that there's the idea of writing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3059" target="_blank">00:50:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">J things in J and APL things in APL is a very powerful idea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3064" target="_blank">00:51:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I always wonder about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3068" target="_blank">00:51:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, sorry, go on. I just remembered your third question. I'll come back to it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3071" target="_blank">00:51:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">No, no, no, you go ahead.

So she's six.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3087" target="_blank">00:51:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And oh, my God, there's so many great educational apps nowadays. There's one called Dragonbox</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3096" target="_blank">00:51:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Algebra. It's so much fun. Dragonbox Algebra five plus. And it's like five plus algebra,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3102" target="_blank">00:51:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">like what the hell? So when she's, I think she actually says still four, I gave, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3106" target="_blank">00:51:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I let her play with Dragonbox Algebra five plus. And she learned Algebra, you know, by helping</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3112" target="_blank">00:51:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Dragon eggs hatch. And she liked it so much, I let her try doing Dragonbox Algebra 12 plus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3120" target="_blank">00:52:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And she loved that as well and finished it. And so suddenly I had a five year old kid that liked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3125" target="_blank">00:52:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Algebra. Much, much surprised. Kids really can surprise you. And so, yeah, she struggled with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3136" target="_blank">00:52:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of the math that they were meant to be doing at primary school, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3140" target="_blank">00:52:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">like the vision and modification, but she liked Algebra. And we ended up homeschooling her.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3148" target="_blank">00:52:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And then one of our, her best friend is also homeschooled. So this, this year I decided I'd</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3155" target="_blank">00:52:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">try tutoring them in math together. And so my daughter's name's Claire, so her friend Gabe,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3164" target="_blank">00:52:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">so her friend Gabe discovered on his Mac the world of alternative keyboards. So he would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3169" target="_blank">00:52:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">start typing in the chat in, you know, Greek characters or Russian characters. And one day</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3175" target="_blank">00:52:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I was like, okay, check this out. So I like typed in some APL characters and they were just like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3181" target="_blank">00:53:01.520</a></span> | <span class="t">wow, what's that? We need that. So initially we installed dialogue APL so that they could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3188" target="_blank">00:53:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">type APL characters in the chat. And so I explained to them that this is actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3196" target="_blank">00:53:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">this like super fancy math that you're typing in. And they really wanted to try it. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3202" target="_blank">00:53:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and that was at the time I was trying to teach them sequences and series,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3208" target="_blank">00:53:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and they were not getting it at all. It was my first total failure time as a, as a math tutor</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3215" target="_blank">00:53:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">with them, you know, they'd been zipping along, fractions, you know, greatest common denominator,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3222" target="_blank">00:53:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">factor trees. Okay, everything's fine. It makes sense. And then we hit sequences and series. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3227" target="_blank">00:53:47.040</a></span> | <span class="t">it's just like, they had no idea what I was talking about. So we put that aside. Then we spent like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3235" target="_blank">00:53:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">three one hour lessons doing the basics of APL, you know, the basic operations and doing stuff</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3243" target="_blank">00:54:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">with lists and dyadic versus monadic, but still, you know, just primary school level math.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3251" target="_blank">00:54:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And we also did the same thing in NumPy using Jupyter. And they really enjoyed all that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3256" target="_blank">00:54:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">like they were more engaged than our normal lessons. And so then we came back to like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3263" target="_blank">00:54:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, sigma i equals one to five of i squared, whatever. And I was like, okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3269" target="_blank">00:54:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">that means this, you know, in APL and this in NumPy. And they're like, oh, is that all?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3278" target="_blank">00:54:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Fine. With, you know, that's like, yeah, so that was a problem. This idea of like Tn equals Tn</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3285" target="_blank">00:54:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">minus one plus blah, blah, blah, blah. It's like, what is this stuff? But when you're actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3290" target="_blank">00:54:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">indexing real things and can print out the intermediate values and all that, and you've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3296" target="_blank">00:54:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">got iota or a range, they were just like, oh, okay. You know, I don't know why you explained it this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3303" target="_blank">00:55:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">dumb way before. And I will say, given a choice between doing something on a whiteboard or doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3309" target="_blank">00:55:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">something in NumPy or doing something in APL, now they will always pick APL because the APL version</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3315" target="_blank">00:55:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">is just so much easier. You know, there's less to type, there's less to think about,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3320" target="_blank">00:55:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">there's less boilerplate. And so it's been, it's only been a few weeks, but like yesterday,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3326" target="_blank">00:55:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">we did the power operator, you know, and so we literally started doing the foundations of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3332" target="_blank">00:55:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">metamathematics. So it's like, okay, let's create a function called capital S, capital S arrow,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3338" target="_blank">00:55:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, plus jot one, right? So for those Python people listening, jot is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3346" target="_blank">00:55:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">if you give it an array or a scalar, it's the same as partial in Python or bind in C++.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3359" target="_blank">00:55:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So, okay, we've now got something that adds one to things. Okay. I said, okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3362" target="_blank">00:56:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">this is called the successor function. And so I said to them, okay, what would happen if we go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3366" target="_blank">00:56:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">SSS zero? And they're like, oh, that would be three. And so I said, okay, well, what's,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3374" target="_blank">00:56:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">what's addition? And then one of them's like, oh, it's, it's repeated S. I'm like, yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3379" target="_blank">00:56:19.520</a></span> | <span class="t">it's repeated S. So how do we say repeated? So in APL, we say repeated by using this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3384" target="_blank">00:56:24.720</a></span> | <span class="t">star diuresis. It's called power. Okay. So now we've done that. What is multiplication?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3390" target="_blank">00:56:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And then one of them goes after a while. Oh, it's repeated addition. So we define addition,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3396" target="_blank">00:56:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and then we define multiplication. And then I'm like, okay, well, what about, you know, exponent?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3403" target="_blank">00:56:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, that's just, now this one, they've heard a thousand times. They both are immediately like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3407" target="_blank">00:56:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">oh, that's repeated multiplication. So like, okay, we've now defined that. And then, okay, well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3412" target="_blank">00:56:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">subtraction, that's a bit tricky. Well, it turns out that subtraction is just, you know, is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3418" target="_blank">00:56:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">opposite of something. What's it the opposite of? They both know that. Oh, that's the opposite of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3421" target="_blank">00:57:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">addition. Okay. Well, opposite of, which in math, we call inverse is just a negative power. So now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3428" target="_blank">00:57:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">we define subtraction. So how would you define division? Oh, okay. How would you define roots?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3433" target="_blank">00:57:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, okay. So we kind of like, you know, designing the foundations of, of mathematics here at APL,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3442" target="_blank">00:57:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, with a six year old and an eight year old. And during this whole thing at one point,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3447" target="_blank">00:57:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">we're like, okay, well, now I can't remember why, but we're like, okay, now we got to do one divided</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3452" target="_blank">00:57:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">by a half. And they both like, we don't know how to do that. So, you know, APL, this stuff that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3458" target="_blank">00:57:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">considered like college level math suddenly becomes easy. And, you know, at the point when still</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3465" target="_blank">00:57:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">primary school level math, like one divided by a half is considered hard. So it definitely made</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3470" target="_blank">00:57:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">me rethink, you know, what is easy and what is hard and how to teach this math stuff. And I've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3478" target="_blank">00:57:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">been doing a lot of teaching of math with APL and the kids are loving it. And I'm loving it. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3484" target="_blank">00:58:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">that's actually why I started this study group, which will be on today. Today, as we record this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3491" target="_blank">00:58:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">a few days ago, as you put it out there, as I kind of started saying on Twitter to people like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3497" target="_blank">00:58:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">oh, it's really been fun teaching my kids, you know, my kid and a friend math using APL and a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3503" target="_blank">00:58:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">adults were like, ah, can we learn math using APL as well?

Yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3542" target="_blank">00:59:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">this stuff.

I'll be like, here's a cool thing in APL. And like half the replies will be like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3553" target="_blank">00:59:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">well, that's line noise. That's not intuitive. It's like, how do you say that? It's this classic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3561" target="_blank">00:59:21.280</a></span> | <span class="t">thing that I've always said, it's like the difference between what you said that you don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3565" target="_blank">00:59:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">understand it, or is it that it's hard? And, you know, kids don't know for kids, everything's new.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3572" target="_blank">00:59:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So that, you know, they see something they've never seen before.

Therefore, it's too hard for me. Therefore, I'm gonna belittle the very idea of the thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3587" target="_blank">00:59:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I did, I did a tacit program on one liner on APL farm the other day. And somebody said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3594" target="_blank">00:59:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that looks like Greek to me. I said, well, Greek looks like Greek to me, because I don't know Greek.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3598" target="_blank">00:59:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, sure. If you don't know it, absolutely, it looks silly. But if you know it, then it's,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3604" target="_blank">01:00:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">it's not that hard. Yeah, I will say like, you know, a lot of people have put a lot of hard work into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3612" target="_blank">01:00:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">resources for APL and J teaching. But I think there's still a long way to go. And one of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3620" target="_blank">01:00:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">challenges is, it's like when I was learning Chinese, I really wanted to I like the idea of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3626" target="_blank">01:00:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">learning Chinese new words by looking them up in a Chinese dictionary. But of course, I didn't know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3631" target="_blank">01:00:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">what the characters in the dictionary meant. So I couldn't look them up. So when I learned Chinese,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3635" target="_blank">01:00:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I really spent the first 18 months just focused on learning characters. So I got through 6000</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3641" target="_blank">01:00:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">characters in 18 months of very hard work. And then I could start looking things up in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3647" target="_blank">01:00:47.040</a></span> | <span class="t">dictionary. My hope is to do a similar thing for APL, like for these study groups,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3653" target="_blank">01:00:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to try to find a way to introduce every glyph in an order that never refers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3661" target="_blank">01:01:01.040</a></span> | <span class="t">to glyphs you haven't learned yet. Like that's something I don't feel like we really have. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3665" target="_blank">01:01:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">so that then you can look up stuff in the dialogue documentation. Because now still, I don't know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3671" target="_blank">01:01:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">that many glyphs. So like most of the stuff in the documentation, I don't understand because it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3677" target="_blank">01:01:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">explains glyphs using glyphs I don't yet know. And then I look those up. And those are used,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3681" target="_blank">01:01:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">explain things with glyphs I don't yet know. So, you know, step one for me is I think we're just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3687" target="_blank">01:01:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">going to go through and try to teach what every glyph is. And then I feel like we should be able</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3692" target="_blank">01:01:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to study this better together, because then we could actually read the documentation, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3698" target="_blank">01:01:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to publish these sessions online. Yeah, so the study group will be recorded as videos.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3705" target="_blank">01:01:45.840</a></span> | <span class="t">But I also then want to actually create, you know, written materials using Jupiter,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3712" target="_blank">01:01:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">which I will then publish. That's my goal. So what you said very much resonates with me,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3718" target="_blank">01:01:58.720</a></span> | <span class="t">that I often find myself in the when teaching people this this bind that to explain everything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3726" target="_blank">01:02:06.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I need to already have everything explained. And I think so and especially it comes down to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3732" target="_blank">01:02:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">in order to explain what many of these glyphs are doing, I need some fancy arrays. If I restrict</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3738" target="_blank">01:02:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">myself to simple vectors and scalers, then I can't really show their power. And I cannot create these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3744" target="_blank">01:02:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">higher rank arrays without already using those glyphs. And so hopefully, it is this long running</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3750" target="_blank">01:02:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">project since like 2015, I think it is, is to add a literal array notation to APL.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3757" target="_blank">01:02:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there is a way in, then you can start by looking at an array, and then you can start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3765" target="_blank">01:02:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">manipulating and see the effects of the glyphs and intuit from there what they do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3769" target="_blank">01:02:49.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, no, I think that'll be very, very helpful. And in the meantime, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3774" target="_blank">01:02:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">my approach with the kids has just been to teach row quite early on. So row is the equivalent of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3780" target="_blank">01:03:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">reshape in Python, most Python libraries. And yeah, so once you know how to reshape,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3789" target="_blank">01:03:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">you can start with a vector and shape it to anything you like. And it's, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3793" target="_blank">01:03:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">it's not a difficult concept to understand. So I think that yeah, basically, the trick at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3797" target="_blank">01:03:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">moment is just to say, okay, in our learning of the dictionary of APL, one of the first things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3802" target="_blank">01:03:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">we will learn is, is row. And that was really fun with the kids doing monadic row, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3809" target="_blank">01:03:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to be like, okay, well, what's row of this? What's row of that? And okay, what's row of row of this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3814" target="_blank">01:03:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And then what's row of row of row, which then led me to the to the storm and poem about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3824" target="_blank">01:03:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">what is it row row row is one, etc, etc, which they loved as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3832" target="_blank">01:03:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, we'll link that in the show notes. Also, too, while you were saying all that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3836" target="_blank">01:03:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">that really resonated me with me when I first started learning APL is like one of the first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3843" target="_blank">01:04:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">things that happened when I was like, okay, you can, you can fold, you can map. So like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3848" target="_blank">01:04:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">how do you filter, you know, what are the classic, you know, three functional things? And the problem</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3853" target="_blank">01:04:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">with APL and array languages is they don't have an equivalent filter that takes a predicate function,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3858" target="_blank">01:04:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">they have a filter that is called compress that takes a mask that, you know, drops anything that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3863" target="_blank">01:04:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">corresponds to a zero. And it wasn't until a few months later that I ended up discovering it. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3868" target="_blank">01:04:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">for both APL and the newer APL BQN, there's these two sites, Adam was the one that wrote the APL one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3875" target="_blank">01:04:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">apple cart dot info, and bacon crate dot info, I also think. And so you can basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3881" target="_blank">01:04:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">semantically search for what you're trying to do.

And really, really often, sometimes you need to know the exact thing that it's called,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3903" target="_blank">01:05:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">like one time I was searching for, you know, all the combinations or permutations. And really,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3907" target="_blank">01:05:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">what I was looking for was power set. And so until you have that, you know, the word power set,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3911" target="_blank">01:05:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">it's, you know, it's a fuzzy search, right? So but it's still a very, very useful tool when it's like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3918" target="_blank">01:05:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you said, you're trying to learn something like Chinese. And it's like, well, where do I even</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3921" target="_blank">01:05:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">start I don't I don't know the language to search the words to search for. But yeah, it is. I agree</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3929" target="_blank">01:05:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">that there's a large room from improvement and how to onboard people without them immediately going,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3935" target="_blank">01:05:35.520</a></span> | <span class="t">like you said, this looks like hieroglyphics, which I think Iverson considered a compliment,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3939" target="_blank">01:05:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">like there's some anecdote I've heard where someone was like, this is hieroglyphics. And he says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3942" target="_blank">01:05:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">yes, exactly. And then the other thing like that I want to do is help in particular Python programmers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3952" target="_blank">01:05:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and maybe also do something for JavaScript programmers, which are the two most popular</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3955" target="_blank">01:05:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">languages, like at the moment, like a lot of the tutorials for stuff like J or whatever,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3961" target="_blank">01:06:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">like J for C programmers, you know, great book, but most people aren't C programmers. And also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3967" target="_blank">01:06:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of the stuff like, you know, it'd be so much easier if somebody just like said to me early on,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3974" target="_blank">01:06:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">oh, you know, just the same as partial in Python, you know, or it's like, you know, putting things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3983" target="_blank">01:06:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">in a box, what the hell's a box if somebody basically said, oh, it's basically the same</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3986" target="_blank">01:06:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">as a reference. It's like, oh, okay, you know, I think it one of your podcasts, somebody said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3990" target="_blank">01:06:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">oh, it's like void stars. Oh, yeah, okay. You know, this is kind of like lack of just saying,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=3996" target="_blank">01:06:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">like, this is actually the same thing as in Python and JavaScript. So I do want to do some kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4002" target="_blank">01:06:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah, mapping, yeah, like that, particularly for kind of NumPy programmers and stuff, because a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4010" target="_blank">01:06:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">lot of it's so extremely similar. Be nice to kind of say like, okay, well, this is, you know, J</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4016" target="_blank">01:06:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">maps things over leading axes, which is exactly the same as NumPy, except it doesn't have trailing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4022" target="_blank">01:07:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">axes. So if you know the NumPy rules, you basically know the J rules. Yeah, I think I think at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4029" target="_blank">01:07:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">basic level, you're absolutely right. And that that would certainly be really useful. When we've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4034" target="_blank">01:07:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">talked this over before, some of the challenges are in the flavors and the details. If you send</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4041" target="_blank">01:07:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">somebody down the wrong road with a metaphor that almost works in some of these areas, it can really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4046" target="_blank">01:07:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">be challenging for them, because they see it in with, you know, through their lens of their experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4053" target="_blank">01:07:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">But that would say, in this area, it would work differently than it actually does. So there is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4059" target="_blank">01:07:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">challenge in that. And we find it even between APL, BQN and J. I'm trying to think of what we were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4066" target="_blank">01:07:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">talking about. Oh, it was transpose, the language, the language is dyadic transpose is they hand,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4071" target="_blank">01:07:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">they handle them differently. They're functionally, you can do the same things, but you have to be a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4076" target="_blank">01:07:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">aware that they are going to do it differently, according to the language. Absolutely. But that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4081" target="_blank">01:08:01.520</a></span> | <span class="t">not a reason to throw out the analogy, right? Like, I think everybody agrees that that it's easier for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4086" target="_blank">01:08:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">an APL programmer to learn J, than for a C or JavaScript programmer to learn J, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4094" target="_blank">01:08:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">because there are some ideas you understand. And you can actually say to people like, okay, well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4099" target="_blank">01:08:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">this is the rank conjunction in J.

So if we can do something like that and say like, oh, well, okay, this would do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4109" target="_blank">01:08:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the same thing as, you know, dot permute, dot blah in PyTorch.

So I think, yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4364" target="_blank">01:12:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that does help a lot. Like, like Connor said, like you've probably come across, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4369" target="_blank">01:12:49.360</a></span> | <span class="t">map and reduce and filter and certainly in Python, you'll have done list comprehensions and dictionary</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4376" target="_blank">01:12:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">comprehensions. And a lot of people have done SQL. So it's, yeah, I think a lot of people come into it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4384" target="_blank">01:13:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">with some relevant analogies, if we can help connect for them.

But I've mentioned on previous podcasts that really what would be amazing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4428" target="_blank">01:13:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and it would only work to a certain extent is something like a multidirectional array language</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4435" target="_blank">01:13:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">transpiler and adding NumPy to that list would probably be, you know, a huge, I don't know what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4440" target="_blank">01:14:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the word for it is, but beneficial for the array community.

That's a project I've been thinking about is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4487" target="_blank">01:14:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">basically rewrite NumPy in APL.

And people can explore that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4500" target="_blank">01:15:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">by opening them up and seeing how they're defined. Oh, so not actually you're saying like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4507" target="_blank">01:15:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">it wouldn't be a new thing. You're just saying like, rename the symbols, what they're known as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4512" target="_blank">01:15:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">in NumPy so that you'd still be in a, like an APL. Yeah. I mean, you could use it as a library,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4519" target="_blank">01:15:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">but I was thinking of it more as an interactive exploring type thing, where you open up this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4524" target="_blank">01:15:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">library and then you, you write the name of some NumPy thing functionality and open it up in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4534" target="_blank">01:15:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">editor and see, well, how is this defined in APL? And then you could use it obviously, since it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4540" target="_blank">01:15:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">defined. Interesting. Then you could slowly, you could use these library functions. And then as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4547" target="_blank">01:15:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">you get better at APL, you can start actually writing out the raw APL instead of using these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4552" target="_blank">01:15:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">covers for it.

Do you think that, because you've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4557" target="_blank">01:15:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">mentioned about sort of the notation versus the programming language and where do you think the,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4564" target="_blank">01:16:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">like, in your dream scenario, are you actually coding in sort of an Iversonian like notation?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4571" target="_blank">01:16:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Or is it at the end of the day, does it still look like NumPy, but it's just all of the expressivity</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4579" target="_blank">01:16:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and power that you have in the language like APL is brought to and combined with what NumPy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4585" target="_blank">01:16:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of currently looks like? I mean, well, it'd be a bit of a combination, Connor, in that, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4590" target="_blank">01:16:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, my classes and my type dispatch and my packaging and, you know, all the, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4600" target="_blank">01:16:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">my function definitions and whatever, that's Python.

And so it'd be, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4619" target="_blank">01:16:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">basically an embedded DSL for kind of high dimensional notation. It would work automatically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4629" target="_blank">01:17:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">on NumPy arrays and TensorFlow tensors and PyTorch tensors. I mean, one thing that's interesting is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4636" target="_blank">01:17:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to a large degree, APL and PyTorch and friends have actually arrived at a similar place</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4647" target="_blank">01:17:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">with the same, you know, grandparents, which is, Iverson actually said his inspiration</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4656" target="_blank">01:17:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">for some of the APL ideas was tensor analysis. And a lot of the folks, as you can gather from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4663" target="_blank">01:17:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the fact that in PyTorch, we don't call them arrays, we call them tensors. A lot of the folks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4667" target="_blank">01:17:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">working on deep learning, their inspiration was also from tensor analysis. So it comes from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4671" target="_blank">01:17:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">physics, right? And so I would say, you know, a lot more folks have worked on PyTorch. We're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4677" target="_blank">01:17:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">familiar with tensor analysis and physics than we're familiar with APL. And then, of course,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4683" target="_blank">01:18:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">there's been other notations, like explicitly based on Einstein notation, there's a thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4690" target="_blank">01:18:10.080</a></span> | <span class="t">called INOPS, which like takes, it's a very interesting kind of approach of taking Einstein</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4695" target="_blank">01:18:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">notation much further. And like Einstein notation, if you think about it, is the kind of the loop</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4701" target="_blank">01:18:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">free programming of math, right? The equivalent of loops in math is indices. And Einstein notation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4708" target="_blank">01:18:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">does away with indices. And so that's why stuff like INOPS is incredibly powerful because you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4713" target="_blank">01:18:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">write, you know, an expression in INOPS with no indices and no loops. And it's all implicit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4722" target="_blank">01:18:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">reductions and implicit loops. I guess, yeah, my ideal thing would be, we wouldn't have to use INOPS,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4729" target="_blank">01:18:49.520</a></span> | <span class="t">we can use APL, you know, and it wouldn't be embedded in a string. They would actually be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4735" target="_blank">01:18:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">operators. Yeah, that's what it is. They'd be operators in the language. The Python operators</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4740" target="_blank">01:19:00.160</a></span> | <span class="t">would not just be plus times minus slash, that would be all the APL glyphs would be Python</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4752" target="_blank">01:19:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">operators. And they would work on all Python data types, including all the different tensor and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4758" target="_blank">01:19:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">array data types. Interesting. Yeah. So it sounds like you're describing a kind of hybrid language.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4764" target="_blank">01:19:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">JavaScript too.

And I feel like I saw that somewhere. I feel like I saw somebody actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=4774" target="_blank">01:19:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">do an ECMA script, you know, RFC with an implementation.

As an educator, and you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=5947" target="_blank">01:39:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">it seems like you operate in this space. Do you have advice to tell folks, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=5953" target="_blank">01:39:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, so much, Connor, I actually kind of embedded in my courses a lot. I can give you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=5959" target="_blank">01:39:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">some quick summaries. But what I will say is, my friend Radhika Zmalski, who's been taking my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=5965" target="_blank">01:39:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">courses for like four years, has taken everything I've said, and his experience of those things and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=5973" target="_blank">01:39:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">turned it into a book. So if you read, Zmalski's book is called Meta Learning, powerful mental</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=5982" target="_blank">01:39:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">models for deep learning. This is learning as in learning deeply. So yeah, check out his book,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=5989" target="_blank">01:39:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">to get the full answer. I mean, there's just, gosh, there's a lot of things you can do to make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=5995" target="_blank">01:39:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">learning easier. You know, and a key thing I do in my courses is I always teach top down. So like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=6006" target="_blank">01:40:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">often people with like, let's take deep learning and neural networks, they'll be like, okay, well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=6010" target="_blank">01:40:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">first, I'm going to have to learn linear algebra and calculus and blah, blah, blah. And, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=6016" target="_blank">01:40:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">four or five years later, they still haven't actually trained a neural network. Our approach</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=6021" target="_blank">01:40:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">in our course is in lesson one, the very first thing you do in the first 15 minutes is you train</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=6026" target="_blank">01:40:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">a neural network.

So that's, you know, you want to be playing. And if you're doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=6059" target="_blank">01:40:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">stuff from the start, that's fun and interesting and useful, then top down, doesn't mean it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=6067" target="_blank">01:41:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">shallow, you can then work from there to like, then understand like, what's each line of code</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=6072" target="_blank">01:41:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">doing? And then how is it doing it? And then why is it doing it? And then what happens if we do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=6076" target="_blank">01:41:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">it a different way? And until eventually, with with our fast AI program, you actually end up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=6083" target="_blank">01:41:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">rewriting your own neural network library from scratch, which means you have to very deeply</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=6088" target="_blank">01:41:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">understand every single part of it. And then we start reading research papers. And then we start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=6092" target="_blank">01:41:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">learning about how to implement those research papers in the library we just wrote. So yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=6097" target="_blank">01:41:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I'd say go top down, make it fun, make it applied. For things like APL or Chinese, where there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=6105" target="_blank">01:41:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">just stuff you have to remember, use Anki, use repetitive space learning. You know, that's been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=6112" target="_blank">01:41:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">around, Ebbinghaus came up with that, I don't know what, 250, 200 years ago, it works, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=6122" target="_blank">01:42:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">everybody, if you tell them something, will forget it in a week's time, everybody, you know, and so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=6128" target="_blank">01:42:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you shouldn't expect to read something and remember it.

And it'll make sure it's impossible to forget it, you know, so it's,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=6154" target="_blank">01:42:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">it's depressing to study things that then disappear. And so it's important to recognize</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=6160" target="_blank">01:42:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that unless you use Anki or super memo or something like that, unless you use it every day,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=6167" target="_blank">01:42:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">it will, it will disappear. But if you do use repetitive space learning, it's guaranteed not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=6173" target="_blank">01:42:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">to. And I told this to my daughter, a couple of years ago, I said, I, you know, what if I told you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=6180" target="_blank">01:43:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">there was a way you can guarantee to never ever forget something you want to know? It's just like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=6186" target="_blank">01:43:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">that's impossible. This is like some kind of magic. It's like, no, it's not magic. And like, I sat down</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=6193" target="_blank">01:43:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and I drew out the Ebbinghaus forgetting curves and explained how it works. And I explained how,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=6200" target="_blank">01:43:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, if you get quizzed on it in these schedules, it flattens out. And she was just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AlSPyGWNr4&t=6205" target="_blank">01:43:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">like, what do you think?
