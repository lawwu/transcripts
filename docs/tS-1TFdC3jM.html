life?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tS-1TFdC3jM&t=15" target="_blank">00:00:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think I'm going to fudge a

have read Arminians dead and alive, but they have not, by and large, been very influential.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tS-1TFdC3jM&t=28" target="_blank">00:00:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The reason for that is that I don't find the Arminian wing of the church to be the most careful exegetes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tS-1TFdC3jM&t=36" target="_blank">00:00:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They tend to be philosophical in their approach to the Bible rather than exegetically rigorous.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tS-1TFdC3jM&t=43" target="_blank">00:00:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Over and over, it's the Calvinists, in my experience, who seem to deal with the Bible most thoroughly and deeply and rigorously and carefully and in detail.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

to be regularly disappointed by the absence or the weakness of exegesis of particular texts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tS-1TFdC3jM&t=94"

answer this question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tS-1TFdC3jM&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But there are not many, but they are significant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tS-1TFdC3jM&t=117" target="_blank">00:01:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right in the front of the line stand John and Charles Wesley, especially Charles, because I have sung his words hundreds of times.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tS-1TFdC3jM&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And how can you not be influenced by "And can it be" or "O for a thousand tongues to sing" or "Jesus, lover of my soul" or "Come thou long expected Jesus" or "Christ the Lord is risen today."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tS-1TFdC3jM&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">How can you not go from season to season for 60 years and not be influenced by Charles Wesley?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tS-1TFdC3jM&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, thank you God for this Arminian who wrote such magnificent truth about the things we hold in common that I have zero hesitation to be blessed season in and season out by the hymns of Charles Wesley.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tS-1TFdC3jM&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And his brother John didn't write the poems, but good night.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tS-1TFdC3jM&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What an inspiration from his life, mainly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tS-1TFdC3jM&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Not so much from his writings or his sermons, which I've read some of, but his life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tS-1TFdC3jM&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He was the Arminian counterpart to George Whitefield during the Great Awakening, and what a passion they shared to preach the gospel in season, out of season, outdoors, indoors, to a dying culture in Britain and America, and to dying people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tS-1TFdC3jM&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Wesley was unparalleled in his tirelessness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tS-1TFdC3jM&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I say that even with Whitefield in mind just because he outlived Whitefield.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tS-1TFdC3jM&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Whitefield died early.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tS-1TFdC3jM&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Wesley lived forever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tS-1TFdC3jM&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, he was riding his horse and writing on his horse and preaching from stumps into his 80s.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tS-1TFdC3jM&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so he's a model for me of incredible passion for the gospel, incredible sticktuitiveness, suffering, and the overcoming of amazing obstacles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tS-1TFdC3jM&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">A couple of obstacles I think about that have always inspired me is he was short.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tS-1TFdC3jM&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.000</a></span>
