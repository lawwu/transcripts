30 years old, a friend of mine who grew up in Oregon said, Larry, got to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.440</a></span> | <span class="t">go whitewater rafting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=167"

target="_blank">00:02:49.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I grew up in the Bronx and never had done anything like that, but it sounded fun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And we went down a class three river on the American River, a little bit west of Sacramento.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And I really loved

trips, including big class five rapids all over the country.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It's my favorite pastime.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And you do this with your family as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I've done it with my kids, taking all of them when they were as little as about seven or eight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.340</a></span> | <span class="t">I've done it with my brother

today our discussion is about your book, Enrich Your Future, The Keys to Successful Investing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And I want to start out by talking about who you dedicated the book to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.100</a></span> | <span class="t">You dedicated the book to your grandchildren.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And that was a little bit telling for me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I think the biggest legacy we leave behind us, the way I think of it, is our grandchildren are living messages to a future we'll not see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And hopefully we've done a good job with our kids raising them and taught them how to be good parents by observing our own behaviors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm so proud of each one of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Every day I get joy just from talking to them, whether I have, it's my kids, three of them live here in St. Louis area.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.880</a></span> | <span class="t">The others I get to see a few times a week using WhatsApp.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.060</a></span> | <span class="t">You get to see them live and we try to visit them several times a year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's no greater joy than sitting down with my kids, playing a game, reading a book with them, hitting pickleball with them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.740</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm sure you know what that's like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.120</a></span> | <span class="t">To me, when I read that, I said, I wonder if this is Larry's capstone book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Basically, the book that you've written to summarize your long career as a researcher and a writer and trying to send the message forward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Was that your intent?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, definitely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.820</a></span> | <span class="t">This is the book I personally is my favorite book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I've tried to encapsulate everything that I've learned on major topics, how people think about investing, trying, you know, you and I and Bill Bernstein and John Bogle and a few others have dedicated our careers to try to overcome what Wall Street tries to do and convince people that they have the right way to invest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And sadly, our education system has so failed the public that unless you get an MBA in finance, not just an MBA, you probably haven't taken a single course in capital markets theory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=333" target="_blank">00:05:33.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So investors make so many mistakes, not because they're dumb, if you will, it's not lack of intelligence, it's they're ignorant about what the research, the empirical evidence and economic theory says.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=347" target="_blank">00:05:47.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So I try to come up with a way to help people understand often difficult concepts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=353" target="_blank">00:05:53.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And a friend once told me, Larry, if you give somebody a fact, they will learn.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.780</a></span> | <span class="t">If you tell them a truth, they'll believe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you tell them a story, it will live in their heart forever.</span></div><div

lot of great information that you've learned over the years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=372" target="_blank">00:06:12.460</a></span> | <span class="t">I found interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=375" target="_blank">00:06:15.220</a></span> | <span class="t">You chose Cliff Asnes to do the forward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=378" target="_blank">00:06:18.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Cliff is the founder and managing principal of AQR Capital Management, who earned his PhD from the University of Chicago under Nobel laureate Gene Fama.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=389"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=392" target="_blank">00:06:32.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Interesting in reading Cliff's introduction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=396" target="_blank">00:06:36.700</a></span> | <span class="t">In the end, he says, to be a successful investor, you need to do less, pay less, think about it less, and stay the course just by a diversified index fund.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=408" target="_blank">00:06:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And coming from Cliff, this is quite a statement because he is an active manager.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=413" target="_blank">00:06:53.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, well, first of all, I think Rick Ferry could have written those exact same words that Cliff wrote and quoted at the end.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=421" target="_blank">00:07:01.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And the only thing I would say that's just slightly different is that I would not define Cliff as an active investor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=432" target="_blank">00:07:12.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And here we get into these debates.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=433" target="_blank">00:07:13.800</a></span> | <span class="t">There's no real technical definition of what a passive investor is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=438" target="_blank">00:07:18.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So I like Gene Fama's attempt to clarify this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=442" target="_blank">00:07:22.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Gene said that he defines active management as individual security selection and market timing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=451" target="_blank">00:07:31.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So obviously, index funds don't engage in any of that, but none of Cliff Asnes's funds engage in any of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=460" target="_blank">00:07:40.840</a></span> | <span class="t">None of the funds of Dimensional Fund Advisors, Avantis, Bridgeway, the other families that I use and recommend.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=469" target="_blank">00:07:49.060</a></span> | <span class="t">What they do, they create their own definition of their eligible universe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=475" target="_blank">00:07:55.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So for example, instead of a Russell 2000 small index, you could say, I'll buy the bottom 5% of stocks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=483" target="_blank">00:08:03.620</a></span> | <span class="t">But then they also might add some screens which are based upon the empirical research, like don't buy penny stocks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=492" target="_blank">00:08:12.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Don't buy stocks in bankruptcy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=495" target="_blank">00:08:15.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Don't buy IPOs because the research says, even though they're in an index, they tend to underperform on average.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=503" target="_blank">00:08:23.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So the words I use are, we invest in funds that are systematic, transparent, and replicable, which is, of course, what all index funds are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=514" target="_blank">00:08:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">But not all funds that are systematic, transparent, and replicable are index funds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=520" target="_blank">00:08:40.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think we're in the same ballpark.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=523" target="_blank">00:08:43.240</a></span> | <span class="t">We just play it in a slightly different way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=527" target="_blank">00:08:47.120</a></span> | <span class="t">We might be in the same ballpark, but I think that you're on the other bench with that, quite frankly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=531" target="_blank">00:08:51.000</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:09:09.300</a></span> | <span class="t">But there are many people in the industry, many smart people, who basically have told people who read them and have invested with them that they should be buying index funds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=560" target="_blank">00:09:20.640</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:13:52.300</a></span> | <span class="t">if Duke wins by 24 points, we have to add the 25-point spread to Army's score.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

as a lot of people think.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=850" target="_blank">00:14:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's set by individual investors like you and I, who are making bets and setting the price in the same way stock prices are set.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

it turns out, this will shock people, but a study was done on the NBA, six seasons, and they found that the average error in the point spread was less than one quarter of one point.</span></div><div

group of naive bettors who are often betting with their hearts, maybe they were in the military, so they bet on Army, or they watched Ronald Reagan in the movie, so they bet on Notre Dame, win one for the Gipper.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=901" target="_blank">00:15:01.660</a></span> | <span class="t">They're a bet on their

their hearts, it doesn't matter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=906" target="_blank">00:15:06.680</a></span> | <span class="t">It's the collective wisdom of the markets that sets prices and makes the market efficient.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=913" target="_blank">00:15:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">The quarter of a percent spread that was found in the study was the result of looking at literally thousands of games.</span></div><div

under that spread, but in the aggregate, the crowd is pretty good at figuring out what the risks are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

talking about nominal and real economic growth, earnings growth, interest rates, and other factors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1006" target="_blank">00:16:46.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1007" target="_blank">00:16:47.460</a></span> | <span class="t">The first thing is people should not make the mistake of confusing information with value-added information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1016" target="_blank">00:16:56.420</a></span> | <span class="t">In our previous example, the information that Google is a better company, has a better balance sheet, faster growth of earnings, that's information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1027" target="_blank">00:17:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not value-added information because everyone knows it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1030" target="_blank">00:17:10.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It's in the P.E. ratio.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1032" target="_blank">00:17:12.840</a></span> | <span class="t">The same thing is true about stocks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1035" target="_blank">00:17:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">What sets stocks' prices?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1038" target="_blank">00:17:18.200</a></span> | <span class="t">The expected growth in earnings and the discount rate we use to discount those future expected earnings, plus the safe rate of T-bills.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1051" target="_blank">00:17:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So we take, if T-bills today are five, and we apply to a Ford Motor a 10% cost of capital, we would discount their earnings at 15%, and whatever the earnings are, we're going to get a 15% rate of expected return.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1069" target="_blank">00:17:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, the stock price is going to be low because we're discounting it at a very high rate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1075" target="_blank">00:17:55.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Google, on the other hand, is going to be impacted by the same three things, but we're going to view them as a safer company and probably apply a lower discount rate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1088" target="_blank">00:18:08.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe we apply a 7% discount rate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1091" target="_blank">00:18:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So what happens is we would take the 5% risk-free rate at 7% is 12%, whatever the earnings are, and they're going to be faster growth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1101" target="_blank">00:18:21.720</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just going to mean that faster earnings growth is going to give you a higher stock price today, but your expected return is now 12% because that's the rate you discounted those earnings at.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1114" target="_blank">00:18:34.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So what determines stock prices is not the growth in earnings rate at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1120" target="_blank">00:18:40.860</a></span> | <span class="t">That's true of companies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1122" target="_blank">00:18:42.700</a></span> | <span class="t">That's true of countries or industries.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1127" target="_blank">00:18:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So the fastest growing industries don't necessarily provide the highest rate of return.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1132" target="_blank">00:18:52.700</a></span> | <span class="t">What matters is the discount rate investors apply, and if you think it's a safe investment, you're going to apply a low discount rate, which means you get a high price and a low expected return.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1146" target="_blank">00:19:06.700</a></span> | <span class="t">In the book, I use the story of comparing great companies and high returning investments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1153" target="_blank">00:19:13.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Great companies are, on average, lower returning investments because they're viewed as less risk, and the riskier companies typically have lower growth in earnings, but the market recognizes they're riskier and therefore applies a higher discount rate, and you get the higher return.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1172" target="_blank">00:19:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">When I was talking with Eduardo Rapeto from Avantis, he was describing that exact methodology and how they go about picking a value stocks where they're looking for where the market is using a high discount rate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1185" target="_blank">00:19:45.840</a></span> | <span class="t">That's exactly what Avantis does.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1188" target="_blank">00:19:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">They're not index funds because there's no exact index to replicate, but they choose, say, the 30% of the cheapest stocks relative to some metric.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1200" target="_blank">00:20:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So, index funds are doing exactly the same thing in many cases, unless you're talking about total market funds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1207" target="_blank">00:20:07.140</a></span> | <span class="t">They're often creating their own universe, and they just happen to call it an index, where Eduardo Rapeto's Avantis fund, there is no index, but they look at two things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1219" target="_blank">00:20:19.320</a></span> | <span class="t">One is the cheapness of a stock, but then they might add what Warren Buffett would call the type of stocks that he liked to buy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1228" target="_blank">00:20:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">He's looking for cheap and profitable companies, and they combine those two metrics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1235" target="_blank">00:20:35.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So, they're looking for companies that are both cheap and are historically higher profitability, and we know the research shows that profits tend to persist,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1247" target="_blank">00:20:47.320</a></span> | <span class="t">although the rate of growth of profits tends to decline towards a median over time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1255" target="_blank">00:20:55.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And even if there's a consistency in earnings growth, people will eventually discount that earnings growth by a lower number and therefore cause the value stock to rise in value, and that's the whole idea, I believe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1271" target="_blank">00:21:11.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, exactly right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1273" target="_blank">00:21:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's the interesting thing, Rick, and I don't have a good explanation for it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1277" target="_blank">00:21:17.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Clearly, I think you and I could agree that more profitable companies are less risky.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1284" target="_blank">00:21:24.700</a></span> | <span class="t">They're less likely to suffer in a recession and go bankrupt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1289" target="_blank">00:21:29.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you would think they would get lower returns because the market would adjust, but it turns out that that's not the case, and more profitable companies have delivered a bit of a premium return over the long term.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1304" target="_blank">00:21:44.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think it's mostly due to investor misbehavior.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1309" target="_blank">00:21:49.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So, individual investors, particularly small retail investors, tend to favor these

class="t">The author was Hendrik Bessenbeimer from Arizona State University who studied the stock market from 1926 to 2019</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1410" target="_blank">00:23:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and found that very few stocks actually created the performance of the

powerful example in the empirical research findings of why you shouldn't try to pick stocks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1425" target="_blank">00:23:45.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Bessenbinder's research, which I think is one of the most important pieces of information that we can have to make investment decisions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1434" target="_blank">00:23:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">decisions because it shows just how difficult it is to find the few stocks that are going to outperform.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1441" target="_blank">00:24:01.020</a></span> | <span class="t">What he found is if you took the 4% of the stocks with the best stock returns,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1447" target="_blank">00:24:07.980</a></span> | <span class="t">then all the other stocks provided no return above the risk fee rate, which is one month treasury bills.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1456" target="_blank">00:24:16.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, someone could say, I just have to buy those 4% of stocks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1462" target="_blank">00:24:22.300</a></span> | <span class="t">The problem is almost no one is able to identify that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1466" target="_blank">00:24:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And here's the way I try to explain that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1469" target="_blank">00:24:29.320</a></span> | <span class="t">If you owned all the stocks, you got basically a nice 10% compound return.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1475" target="_blank">00:24:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">If you bought one stock, the average return was well below that, that median return,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1483" target="_blank">00:24:43.140</a></span> | <span class="t">meaning half of the stocks performed much worse than that 10%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1488" target="_blank">00:24:48.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And as you add diversification, you move closer and closer to the average.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1494" target="_blank">00:24:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the more stocks you own, you increase your odds of getting that average return.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1499" target="_blank">00:24:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Think of it as a bell curve.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1501" target="_blank">00:25:01.460</a></span> | <span class="t">You want to get that middle, that high point, getting you the best odds of success.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1506" target="_blank">00:25:06.680</a></span> | <span class="t">There's been studies that went even further back to 200 years and have found exactly what best amount have found,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1514" target="_blank">00:25:14.760</a></span> | <span class="t">both in U.S. markets and international markets.</span></div><div class="c"><span

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1520" target="_blank">00:25:20.820</a></span> | <span class="t">It opened my eyes up of how few stocks give you a better return than T-bills.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1524" target="_blank">00:25:24.760</a></span> | <span class="t">It's really difficult to outperform the market unless you own those 4% of stocks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1530" target="_blank">00:25:30.300</a></span> | <span class="t">But this probably helps explain the conclusion that Fama and French came to when they did their study on luck versus skill in the mutual fund marketplace.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1540" target="_blank">00:25:40.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so what they found was that once you adjusted for exposure to their common factors that explain return,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1551" target="_blank">00:25:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">meaning size and value, profitability, etc., less than 2% of active managers were generating statistically significant alphas.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1561" target="_blank">00:26:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's even before taxes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1563" target="_blank">00:26:03.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So for taxable investors, where taxes are the highest expense, more than the trading costs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1570" target="_blank">00:26:10.380</a></span> | <span class="t">typically more than the expense ratio, even of active funds, the odds are probably 1%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1576" target="_blank">00:26:16.780</a></span> | <span class="t">You don't want to be playing that loser's game where you have a small odds of success.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1582" target="_blank">00:26:22.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's where, you know, people with far more experience, talent, computer resources and everything else,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1590" target="_blank">00:26:30.620</a></span> | <span class="t">they don't win, what are the odds that I'm going to win when I don't have any of their advantages?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1595" target="_blank">00:26:35.780</a></span> | <span class="t">You wrote, just because some investors are smarter than others, that average will not show up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1602" target="_blank">00:26:42.300</a></span> | <span class="t">because the market is too vast and too informationally efficient.</span></div><div

results.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1612" target="_blank">00:26:52.120</a></span> | <span class="t">High efforts do not equal

we wonder why there isn't this persistence of performance when we see it almost everywhere we look in the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

target="_blank">00:27:20.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And so why can't the great stock pickers like, say, Warren Buffett continue to outperform?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1645" target="_blank">00:27:25.900</a></span> | <span class="t">By the way, Buffett has not outperformed the S&P 500 or Berkshire hasn't since

target="_blank">00:27:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">There are two big reasons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1665"

teams,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1678" target="_blank">00:27:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and other games he would face the pitchers on the worst teams,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1682" target="_blank">00:28:02.620</a></span> | <span class="t">and

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1813" target="_blank">00:30:13.100</a></span> | <span class="t">If we could identify them, can we buy an index of those stocks, just buy them all, don't have to buy the 5 or 8 or 10 that Buffett bought.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1822" target="_blank">00:30:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Can we get the same returns?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1825" target="_blank">00:30:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's exactly what has happened.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1828" target="_blank">00:30:28.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And so now everyone knows this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1831" target="_blank">00:30:31.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And now the funds of companies like Dimensional Fund Advisors, Avantis, Bridgeway, they all buy these stocks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1838" target="_blank">00:30:38.100</a></span> | <span class="t">They put them in their construction rules and Buffett can no longer outperform.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1844" target="_blank">00:30:44.500</a></span> | <span class="t">One last thing, Rick, on this issue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1847" target="_blank">00:30:47.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Go back 70 years or so, 90% of all trading was done by retail investors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1853" target="_blank">00:30:53.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So when Buffett was competing and he traded, the odds of 90% there was a naive retail investor on the other side.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1863" target="_blank">00:31:03.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And he was likely to win that game.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1865" target="_blank">00:31:05.240</a></span> | <span class="t">He had more skills.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1866" target="_blank">00:31:06.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Today, 90% of the trading is done by big hedge funds, Renaissance Technology, the Goldman Sachses, Morgan Stanleys of the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1875" target="_blank">00:31:15.660</a></span> | <span class="t">They've paid, you know, all these high powered mathematicians, have all these high speed computers, all the latest artificial intelligence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1884" target="_blank">00:31:24.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So when Buffett's trading, 90% of the chance is he's trading against them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1889" target="_blank">00:31:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">He doesn't have any advantage over them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1892" target="_blank">00:31:32.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's another reason why he can't outperform anymore or hasn't been able to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1898" target="_blank">00:31:38.620</a></span> | <span class="t">The markets are naturally becoming more efficient over time and making it more and more difficult for active managers to win that game.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1907" target="_blank">00:31:47.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, let's get on to another part of the book about behavioral finance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1910" target="_blank">00:31:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">People who are trying to outperform by trying to pick the hot manager, trying to pick the winning strategy, trying to pick the individual investments, believe that they can do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1923" target="_blank">00:32:03.240</a></span> | <span class="t">One reason you pointed out earlier, most have never received a formal education on capital markets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1930" target="_blank">00:32:10.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So when we don't have training on something, we tend to believe what we hear in the media, because the media promotes that type of mentality in a lot of ways by pointing out the outperformance of this strategy, the outperformance of that person, or how this fund has done so well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1949" target="_blank">00:32:29.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And, of course, highlighting advisors and fund managers who bought NVIDIA five years ago, or at least they said they did.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1956" target="_blank">00:32:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And even if they did buy it, they're not going to tell you about the other 50 stocks they bought that didn't go up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1961" target="_blank">00:32:41.540</a></span> | <span class="t">The media has these people on to talk about their winners, not their losers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1965" target="_blank">00:32:45.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So people get the false belief that it's easy to do this, and it causes a lot of behavioral problems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1972" target="_blank">00:32:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">You have to remember whose interest they have at heart.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1976" target="_blank">00:32:56.280</a></span> | <span class="t">The media needs you to tune in so they can sell their advertising time so they can make money.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1983" target="_blank">00:33:03.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And indexing is boring.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1986" target="_blank">00:33:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's why you and I and Bill Bernstein don't appear on CNBC very often, because we're going to tell people basically to tune out CNBC.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=1994" target="_blank">00:33:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I think the last time I was on CNBC was probably 15 years ago, and it had to do with the proliferation of ETFs that really didn't have anything to do with indexing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=2003" target="_blank">00:33:23.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=2005" target="_blank">00:33:25.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And the active management community, the investment firms, except for a few exceptions like Vanguard, they need you to believe that they can identify the winning stocks in and out of the market, so you'll pay their high fees, which the evidence shows, yes, it is possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=2024" target="_blank">00:33:44.500</a></span> | <span class="t">It is possible to outperform.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=2026" target="_blank">00:33:46.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Even Fama and French found, as we said earlier, 2% of the funds that have delivered persistent outperformance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=2033" target="_blank">00:33:53.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So that holds out the hope, and everyone we know, this is just a human trait, doesn't matter whether it's are you a better than average driver or a better average lover, we all are overconfident in our skills.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=2049" target="_blank">00:34:09.060</a></span> | <span class="t">90% of us think we're better than average at everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=2052" target="_blank">00:34:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So we think, yeah, most people fail, but I'm going to succeed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=2056" target="_blank">00:34:16.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And the media plays on that, and they play on this idea how it's easy to beat the market.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=2063" target="_blank">00:34:23.560</a></span> | <span class="t">It is interesting, though, when you talk with people, especially in a bull market, when they bought something that has gone up, they attribute it to skill, not luck.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=2083" target="_blank">00:34:43.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I recall back in the late 1990s, I was working in the brokerage industry during the internet bubble.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=2089"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=2408" target="_blank">00:40:08.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, the answer is if you wouldn't buy it for 500, you should sell it because you

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=2482" target="_blank">00:41:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's not always true.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=2484" target="_blank">00:41:24.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, risky assets can all go down together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=2487" target="_blank">00:41:27.880</a></span> | <span class="t">They can be highly correlated in a bad economy.</span></div><div

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=2494" target="_blank">00:41:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And what people forget is that correlations are nothing more than averages over the

look for an asset that is as low correlation or negative, but how does it react when asset A, let's call that your individual stock portfolio or mutual fund portfolio, how does that tend to act when the stocks crash?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=2521" target="_blank">00:42:01.320</a></span> | <span class="t">A good example is high yield bonds, the correlation, on average may be low, I don't know, maybe it's point two or point three, but when stocks crash, they tend to get hit at the same time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=2535" target="_blank">00:42:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Low correlated, but at the wrong time.</span></div><div

well when your stocks are doing poorly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=2544" target="_blank">00:42:24.540</a></span> | <span

down too, but that's why you diversify across assets that have low correlation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=2578" target="_blank">00:42:58.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's no logical economic reason why they should correlate and both do poorly or both do well at the same time.</span></div><div

half in bonds, especially treasury bonds, quality bonds, that when the stock market goes down, the bonds will save your portfolio.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=2598" target="_blank">00:43:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">They'll reduce the volatility.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=2880" target="_blank">00:48:00.140</a></span> | <span class="t">What do we want to do with all this?</span></div><div

risk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=2884" target="_blank">00:48:04.380</a></span> | <span class="t">How much risk should you take as an investor?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=2886" target="_blank">00:48:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">You have always talked about the three factors of risk, your ability to handle risk, your willingness to handle risk, and you need to take risk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=2895" target="_blank">00:48:15.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Briefly, talk about those three things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=2898" target="_blank">00:48:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the difference between risk and uncertainty, which you make very clear in the book, and I think it's a good point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=2904" target="_blank">00:48:24.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Ability to take risk, most people, even most advisors that I have known, look at ability to take risk and look at only one thing, which is your investment horizon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=2914" target="_blank">00:48:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">The longer you're rising, the longer you have the ability to wait out of their market, and therefore you could take more risk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=2922" target="_blank">00:48:42.120</a></span> | <span class="t">However, there is a second factor, which is really important, and that's your intellectual capital or your labor capital.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=2930" target="_blank">00:48:50.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And the younger you are, the bigger that is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=2934" target="_blank">00:48:54.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what I tell people is, if you're a doctor, a tenured professor, and a CPA, working for the government, you're not subject to economic cycle risk, you can afford to take more stock risk, have a higher allocation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=2950" target="_blank">00:49:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're a construction worker, an automobile worker, maybe a stockbroker, your earnings are more tied to the economic cycle, then you should own less equities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=2960" target="_blank">00:49:20.580</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a really important issue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=2963" target="_blank">00:49:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Second is your willingness to take risk, or your risk tolerance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=2968" target="_blank">00:49:28.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So you ask people, you know, we've seen drops, as much as 50%, not that infrequently, but once a generation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=2976" target="_blank">00:49:36.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And even the Great Depression was 90%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=2979" target="_blank">00:49:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So I tell people, if you're, can't take more than, say, a 30% loss, you probably shouldn't be more than 60% in equities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=2988" target="_blank">00:49:48.520</a></span> | <span class="t">That's at least that leg.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=2990" target="_blank">00:49:50.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And the third leg is your need to take risk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=2992" target="_blank">00:49:52.520</a></span> | <span class="t">For example, let's assume you need $100,000 a year to retire to a lifestyle you're comfortable with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3001" target="_blank">00:50:01.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, we know you can be fairly conservative.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3003" target="_blank">00:50:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">If you've got 30 times that money, that would be $3 million.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3008" target="_blank">00:50:08.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Or if you've got $3 million already, why are you taking a lot of risk?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3012" target="_blank">00:50:12.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Probably should have a portfolio with 20%, 30% equities, if that's all else equal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3019" target="_blank">00:50:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And then just don't worry about the rest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3021" target="_blank">00:50:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">The upside is not worth the downside risk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3025" target="_blank">00:50:25.320</a></span> | <span class="t">The loss of money hurts much more than growing your money.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3029" target="_blank">00:50:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So those are the three things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3031" target="_blank">00:50:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And each leg of that three-legged stool has to be firmly planted, or the stool will tip over when the risk shows up and your stomach yells, GMO, which is, "Get me out!"</span></div><div class="c"><span

thought was really good insight, is during a crisis, investors forget about risk and begin reacting to uncertainty.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

it is risk is where we either know the odds, like when we roll the dice, we know exactly the odds of rolling a snake eyes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

though it's always uncertain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3146" target="_blank">00:52:26.920</a></span> | <span class="t">We don't know what the way the world's going.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3149" target="_blank">00:52:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And we get lots of these black swan events, like Black Monday in 1987, when the market fell 23% in one day, or an oil embargo, or Russia invading Crimea, COVID, etc.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3163" target="_blank">00:52:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">They happen with great frequency, much more than people think.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3168" target="_blank">00:52:48.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And that leads to them having too big an equity position, in my experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3173" target="_blank">00:52:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So then you come up with your, basically the basic advice for investors, which gets back to knowing how much risk you have the ability to take, the willingness to take, or need to take.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3188" target="_blank">00:53:08.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Which is your allocation between risky assets and non-risky assets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3193" target="_blank">00:53:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So call it stocks and risk-free rate or quality bonds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3198" target="_blank">00:53:18.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So your stock side, you recommend, no surprise, a diversified portfolio of global equities in an index fund.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3209" target="_blank">00:53:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Your definition of it, or my definition of it, which we discussed earlier, was a little bit different.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3216" target="_blank">00:53:36.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And bonds, again, either use some quality bond index funds, or in your case, you wrote that you could use individual bonds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3224" target="_blank">00:53:44.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you did this, you would want to use only the highest quality individual bonds, rather than trying to pick credit risk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3231" target="_blank">00:53:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And then finally, stay the course.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3234" target="_blank">00:53:54.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Just adhere to the asset allocation, adhere to the plan that you put together for the long term.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3242" target="_blank">00:54:02.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is very Bogle head-ish.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3245" target="_blank">00:54:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Exactly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3246" target="_blank">00:54:06.920</a></span> | <span class="t">That's John Bogle's own words.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3248" target="_blank">00:54:08.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It's Warren Buffett's words.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3249" target="_blank">00:54:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">He says, don't try to time the market.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3252" target="_blank">00:54:12.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you do, what should you do?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3255" target="_blank">00:54:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You should buy when everyone's panic selling, when there's blood on the street, and you sell when everyone's greedy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3261" target="_blank">00:54:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And Rick, you do that all the time for your clients, without thinking of it that way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3266" target="_blank">00:54:26.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Because what are you doing?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3267" target="_blank">00:54:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You're rebalancing the portfolio to restore it to its asset allocation that you wanted, not allowing the market to dictate your allocation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3276" target="_blank">00:54:36.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So when stocks are outperforming, and you wanted to be 50% stocks, you're a 60.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3283" target="_blank">00:54:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Rick doesn't say anything other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3285" target="_blank">00:54:45.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I'm supposed to be 50.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3287" target="_blank">00:54:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's sell if we have to pay some taxes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3290" target="_blank">00:54:50.920</a></span> | <span class="t">There's only one thing worse than having to pay taxes, and that's not having to pay them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3295" target="_blank">00:54:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So we do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3297" target="_blank">00:54:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to finish this interview with one final question about your book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3303" target="_blank">00:55:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And I've read all of your books, all 18 of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3307" target="_blank">00:55:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">This one had a little bit different flavor to it, in my opinion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3313" target="_blank">00:55:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It was more mainstream, as I said before, more Boglehead-ish.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3318" target="_blank">00:55:18.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm just wondering, in your old age, if you're just trying to make things simpler for yourself, your family, and also all other investors by just sticking with the basics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3333" target="_blank">00:55:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So let me answer it this way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3337" target="_blank">00:55:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">First of all, John Bogle, I think, was the one who said it is investing is simple, it's just not easy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3344" target="_blank">00:55:44.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's not easy because of all the emotional issues and the behavioral mistakes we make.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3350" target="_blank">00:55:50.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Either we get too greedy when the markets are doing well, or we panic and sell when the market's doing poorly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3357" target="_blank">00:55:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">What you want to do is have a portfolio that you have confidence in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3363" target="_blank">00:56:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You understand all the investments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3366" target="_blank">00:56:06.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Because when the markets do do poorly, your stomach is going to get stressed, no matter how disciplined you are, is my experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3375" target="_blank">00:56:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You're going to question yourself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3377" target="_blank">00:56:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you don't have a strong belief system that says this is the right portfolio, you're likely to panic and sell and be subject to recency bias.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3388" target="_blank">00:56:28.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Good example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3389" target="_blank">00:56:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You could understand reinsurance is a great investment or very logical, but it goes through three bad years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3396" target="_blank">00:56:36.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It's down 25%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3397" target="_blank">00:56:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you panic and sell instead of now being a buyer because risk premiums have gone way up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3404" target="_blank">00:56:44.920</a></span> | <span class="t">A disciplined investor will rebalance and buy more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3408" target="_blank">00:56:48.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think the key point that I was trying to make, I kept it simple, but told people I think there are these advantages, but only if you're willing to put in the time, learn about them and become confident.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3422" target="_blank">00:57:02.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It's the same principle applies, Rick.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3425" target="_blank">00:57:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm sure you would agree to owning emerging market stocks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3428" target="_blank">00:57:08.920</a></span> | <span class="t">We both agree you should own a global portfolio, but don't own them if you're going to bail out when emerging markets underperformed for 10 years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3437" target="_blank">00:57:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It's exactly the same principle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3439" target="_blank">00:57:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So keep it as simple as you need to so that you can stay the course.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3445" target="_blank">00:57:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a great final words.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7NjhYs9Iw4&t=3446" target="_blank">00:57:26.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, Larry, thank you so much
