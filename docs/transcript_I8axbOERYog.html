The only hack here would be if you want to really try to aggregate points in one place. So for example, when my wife and I are traveling, I earn all the Marriott and Hyatt points. She earns all the Hilton points.</p><p>Something that works pretty well is you could book a room in whoever's name earns the points, put in the notes, the other person is checking in, and usually it's no problem for the other person to check in and keep the other person on the reservation. So if I were going to stay at a Hilton without my wife, I would probably still book it in her name and have a note that says my husband will be checking in before me so that we could just continue to both use her status and earn points there.</p></div></div></body></html>
