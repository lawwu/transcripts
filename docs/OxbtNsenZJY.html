So, there's debate around who discovered</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3631" target="_blank">01:00:31.520</a></span> | <span class="t">CRISPR-Cas systems first and found their application.

So the guide RNA is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3984" target="_blank">01:06:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">just RNA.

And so in order to show Microsoft did active to try to be a blocker</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4284" target="_blank">01:11:24.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and own the open source.

And then using that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4372" target="_blank">01:12:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">trained model, they then started to run inference on it, to say, come up with cast systems that are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4378" target="_blank">01:12:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">novel, that could theoretically have efficacy greater than what we see in nature with the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4383" target="_blank">01:13:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">natural cast systems. And then the model started to output all of these novel proteins, then they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4387" target="_blank">01:13:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">started to test them. And they found that this one worked really, really well after testing in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4392" target="_blank">01:13:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the lab. So actually, here's a great image. So here you can see, basically in training the model,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4398" target="_blank">01:13:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">so it's a little bit technically complicated what they did in the steps to generate this system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4403" target="_blank">01:13:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">But ultimately, the system yielded something that they could then create, put in a lab environment,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4408" target="_blank">01:13:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and in the lab environment, test how well it worked. And what they showed was that it actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4412" target="_blank">01:13:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">worked better than cast nine, which is the primary gene editing protein is today.
