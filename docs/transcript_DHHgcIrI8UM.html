Like the purpose of praise is to let them know what to do more of. In fact, if you think about radical candor as helping someone else scratch an itch on an unreachable spot in your back, you know, you got to say, yeah, that's good or no, that's not good.</p><p>And you need to be able to say both. So praise is really important, but let's say this is not praise. This is a little criticism. You want to give someone who you love and who knows that you love them. Hopefully, you know them well enough to know how things land for them.</p><p>So you want to go in, make sure that you're humble, that you're not sure you're right. To me, I call it candor and not the truth. Candor implies here's how I understand the situation. I'm also really curious to know how you understand the situation.</p></div></div></body></html>
