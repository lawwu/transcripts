And specifically in the NBA,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9u_nejX7NVU&t=51" target="_blank">00:00:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the game has devolved into essentially rebounds and dunks, or three pointers.

At the same time, because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9u_nejX7NVU&t=64" target="_blank">00:01:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">of the fact that the TV deals are really what determines the discounted value of these sports</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9u_nejX7NVU&t=69" target="_blank">00:01:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">franchises. The TV deal was so enormous, that it creates no reliable rivalries anymore. Because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9u_nejX7NVU&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">people will hopscotch teams almost every year, because the compensation that they can get is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9u_nejX7NVU&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">just so obscene, quite honestly. And I think what happens is, sports will have a decent run</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9u_nejX7NVU&t=90" target="_blank">00:01:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">until the next TV deals get done. And I think if you, for example, take pharma ads outside of TV,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9u_nejX7NVU&t=99" target="_blank">00:01:39.040</a></span> | <span class="t">so like that pool shrinks, if you have less viewership, and so you can sell the remaining ads</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9u_nejX7NVU&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">less effectively, because there's just fewer of them, and then there's fewer buyers, and it shrinks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9u_nejX7NVU&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">yet again, then the dollar pool that the television networks and the streamers are going to be willing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9u_nejX7NVU&t=118" target="_blank">00:01:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to pay for sports will go down. And the group that will be the most price sensitive are exactly who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9u_nejX7NVU&t=124" target="_blank">00:02:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you said, Gavin, meaning the non-trophy buyers. So when I bought into the Warriors, I bought it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9u_nejX7NVU&t=129" target="_blank">00:02:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">purely as a trophy asset, and I was price insensitive. But I agree with you that now that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9u_nejX7NVU&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you have the PE firms on the cap tables of these sports franchises, those folks are all DCFs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9u_nejX7NVU&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">those folks are all Excel models. I don't think that they're buying things for emotion. I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9u_nejX7NVU&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">think they've grown up thinking, "I want to own this thing," not using institutional LP dollars.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9u_nejX7NVU&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So I just think that's why I said that in '24, so I just want to be clear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9u_nejX7NVU&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">On behalf of Phil Hummuth and I, we appreciate you made that vanity investment for the number</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9u_nejX7NVU&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">of times we got to sit in your court side seats.
