Just quickly though, yes, it is powered by the new</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=65" target="_blank">00:01:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">O3 model and in case you're not familiar with all the names, that's their most powerful one,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=70" target="_blank">00:01:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">not the O3 Mini that was announced just a few days ago. I did do a video on that one,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=75" target="_blank">00:01:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">which is different to O1 Pro mode, which I also did a video on. Oh, and by the way,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=81" target="_blank">00:01:21.280</a></span> | <span class="t">both of those are different from GPT-40 and GPT-4. Anyway, basically, it's their best model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=87" target="_blank">00:01:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and they're using it to do this deep research, that's kind of all that really matters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=90" target="_blank">00:01:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Just quickly before my tests, you may have heard about a benchmark called</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">"Humanity's Last Exam", which I think is pretty inappropriately titled. What it essentially tests</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=99" target="_blank">00:01:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">is really arcane, obscure knowledge and whether the model can piece together those bits of knowledge</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=104" target="_blank">00:01:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to get a question right. So actually, it didn't surprise me that much that on this, quote,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">"Humanity's Last Exam", the performance when given access to the web of this deep research agent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">shot up. My main takeaway from this performance on this benchmark is that if you want obscure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">knowledge, then OpenAI's deep research agent is the place to go. Oh, and by the way, the lead</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">author of that exam says he doesn't expect it to survive the optimization pressures of 2025.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">More interestingly for me, actually, was this Gaia benchmark about whether an AI can truly be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=138" target="_blank">00:02:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">a useful assistant. Why would it be more interesting? Well, three reasons. First,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the tasks are more relatable. Research this specific conference and answer this specific</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">nuanced question. That's just level one, by the way, and then level three questions are things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">like this one. Research a very obscure set of standards and research what percent of those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">standards have been superseded by 2023. Reason number two is that the benchmark was co-authored</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.120</a></span> | <span class="t">by noted LLM skeptic Yan LeCun. Here was the state of the art in April 2024. Quote, "We show that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">human respondents obtain 92% versus 15% for GPT-4 equipped with plugins." I checked, by the way,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and one of those plugins was indeed GPT-4 with search. They go on, "This notable performance</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.560</a></span> | <span class="t">disparity, 92% for humans versus 15% for GPT-4 with search, contrasts with the recent trend of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">LLMs outperforming humans on tasks requiring professional skills." Leaving us with the third</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.560</a></span> | <span class="t">reason, which is that yes, OpenAI's deep research agent got around 72-73% on this benchmark. That's,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">by the way, if you pick the answer that it outputs most times out of 64, but if you're harsher and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">just pick its first answer, it still gets 67%. Therefore, two things are true simultaneously.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">The performance leap in just the last, say, nine months is incredible, from 15% to 67 or 72%,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">but it does still remain true that human performance, if you put the effort in,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">is still significantly higher at 92%. Now, just before we get to the DeepSeek R1 comparison and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Gemini's deep research, I can't lie. The first thing that I wanted to do when I got my hands on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">O3, essentially, which is hidden inside deep research, is test it on my own benchmark,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">SimpleBench. It tests spatial reasoning, or you could just say common sense or basic reasoning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Unfortunately, the test didn't really work out because the model relentlessly asked me questions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">instead of actually answering the question. Now, you could say that that's actually a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">brilliant thing because any AGI should ask you clarifying questions. I will say, though,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">that on average, it doesn't just ask you one question. It tends to ask you like four or five,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">even when you beg it just to answer the question. So super annoying or a sign of AGI? I'm going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">let you decide on that one. But on the actual common sense, the actual spatial reasoning,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">it kind of flops. I mean, maybe that's harsh. I only tested it on maybe eight of the questions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.120</a></span> | <span class="t">but I saw no real sign of improvement. I'm not going to spend more time in this video on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">questions like this, but essentially, it doesn't fully grok the real world. It doesn't get that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Cassandra, in this case, would still be able to move quite easily. For another question,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">it has an instinct that something might be up here. But when I say proceed with a reasonable</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=305" target="_blank">00:05:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">assumption on each of those points, it still flops. I must admit, it was kind of interesting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">watching it site all sorts of obscure websites to find out whether a woman could move forwards</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=316" target="_blank">00:05:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and backwards if she had her hands on her thighs. Eventually, I just gave up on asking it simple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">bench questions because it would keep asking me questions until I essentially was solving the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">puzzle for it. Multiple times, by the way, when I refused to answer questions that it was giving to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">me, it just went silent and kind of just stopped. Pro tip, by the way, if you want to get out of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">this logjam, just go to the refresh button and then pick any other model and it will work,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">though still presumably using O3, which I guess is the only one that they're using for deep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">research. This is what it looks like, by the way. You just select deep research at the bottom. It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">not actually a model that you choose in the top left.

How did I do that? Well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=422" target="_blank">00:07:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I used R1 in Perplexity Pro and asked the same question.

It cost me a bunch of money to subscribe to it currently,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=446" target="_blank">00:07:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">but yes, I'm going to use it.

But anyway, how do they do? Unfortunately, in my experience,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=473" target="_blank">00:07:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">it's one of the worst options.

From then on, I stopped testing Deep Research from Gemini</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=486" target="_blank">00:08:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and just focused on Deep Research versus Deep Seek. The TLDR is that Deep Research was better</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=493" target="_blank">00:08:13.680</a></span> | <span class="t">than Deep Seek R1 pretty much every time, although it hallucinated very frequently.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=499" target="_blank">00:08:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Also, Deep Seek didn't aggravate me by relentlessly asking me questions.

And I was proud of that one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=836" target="_blank">00:13:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Now the slick presentation that OpenAI gave did include hidden gems like is DeeperSeeker</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=842" target="_blank">00:14:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">a good name in the chat history. But it didn't go into much detail beyond the release notes about,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=847" target="_blank">00:14:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">for example, what sites deep research could or could not browse. For example, in my testing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=852" target="_blank">00:14:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">it couldn't browse YouTube. Although strangely, it could get this question right by relying on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=858" target="_blank">00:14:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">sources that quoted YouTube. For those who follow the channel in my last video, I asked you guys to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=863" target="_blank">00:14:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">help me find a video in which I predicted that OpenAI's valuation would double this year, which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=868" target="_blank">00:14:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">it has done. And it did find the right video, but not by searching YouTube. That was kind of wild.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=874" target="_blank">00:14:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Ask it for the timestamp, though, and because it can't look at YouTube, it can't actually get that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=879" target="_blank">00:14:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">right. What about shopping advice, though? And this time I was really specific. It's got to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=884" target="_blank">00:14:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">a highly rated toothbrush available in the UK, has to have a battery life of over two months,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=889" target="_blank">00:14:49.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and I even gave it the site to research what the previous price history had been. Essentially,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=895" target="_blank">00:14:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I wanted to know if the purchase I had just made was a good deal. And truth is, I'd already done</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=900" target="_blank">00:15:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">the research, but I just wanted to see if it could do the same thing. I had to, as usual,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=904" target="_blank">00:15:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">wade through a barrage of being questioned/interrogated by the model about the details,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=910" target="_blank">00:15:10.080</a></span> | <span class="t">some of which I'd already told it. But nevertheless, it finally did the research.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=914" target="_blank">00:15:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And it did indeed find the toothbrush that I had bought. So that was great. Unfortunately,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=919" target="_blank">00:15:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">even though I'd given it the specific website to research in about previous price history,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=924" target="_blank">00:15:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">it didn't actually do that. None of these links correspond to Camel Camel Camel. And that is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=930" target="_blank">00:15:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">despite, by the way, saying that it had used Camel Camel Camel. It said using Camel Camel Camel. Yes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=937" target="_blank">00:15:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">that is the name of the website. But none of the links correspond to that website. You might think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=942" target="_blank">00:15:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">well, maybe it got the answer right from the website without quoting the website. But no,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=946" target="_blank">00:15:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">if you actually go to the website, you can see that the cheapest price that this toothbrush had</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=951" target="_blank">00:15:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">been was £63, not the price quoted, I think £66 by Deep Research. In short, don't trust it even</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=959" target="_blank">00:15:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">when it says it has visited a site. How about DeepSeek R1 with search? Well, it completely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=964" target="_blank">00:16:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">hallucinated the battery life, claimed 70 days. It's actually 30 or 35 for this toothbrush.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=970" target="_blank">00:16:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And yes, we can see the thinking, but that means that we can see it completely making something up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=976" target="_blank">00:16:16.640</a></span> | <span class="t">on the spot. It said, now check this site for Amazon UK. Great. Suppose the historical low is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=982" target="_blank">00:16:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">40, which is not, by the way, it didn't bother actually checking the site. So it gives me this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=987" target="_blank">00:16:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">hypothetical result. But by the way, in the summary, it states it as a fact. It's currently</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=993" target="_blank">00:16:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">selling for this. Notice that it actually knows that this is a hypothetical, but phrases it like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=998" target="_blank">00:16:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">a fact in the summary. Now you might say I'm being overly harsh or too generous, but honestly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=1004" target="_blank">00:16:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm just kind of processing how fast things are advancing.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like these kind of small</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=1015" target="_blank">00:16:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">hallucinations are the last thin line of defense for so much of white collar work. On one prompt,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=1022" target="_blank">00:17:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I got deep research to analyze 39 separate references in the DeepSeek R1 paper. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=1029" target="_blank">00:17:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">though it hallucinated a little bit, the results were extraordinary in their depth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=1034" target="_blank">00:17:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">In short, if these models weren't making these kinds of repeated hallucinations,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=1038" target="_blank">00:17:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">wouldn't this news be effectively a redundancy notice for tens of millions of people?

I know many people accuse me of being an AI, but I'm not. But this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=1058" target="_blank">00:17:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">voice, trust me, it was.

And the analysis</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H6vABTz6Wk&t=1062" target="_blank">00:17:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">was pretty decent and the video editing was pretty smooth.
