So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzdc6Dekhs&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So Good They Can't Ignore You was a book that was looking at career advice. And so the idea that I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzdc6Dekhs&t=111" target="_blank">00:01:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">was engaging with from the world of career advice in So Good They Can't Ignore You,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzdc6Dekhs&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">one of the big ideas I was engaging with is what I called courage culture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzdc6Dekhs&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And at the time, so this is the 2000s, the first decade of the 2000s when I was working on this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzdc6Dekhs&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.040</a></span> | <span class="t">courage culture had a really big footprint in the career advice space. And the theory behind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzdc6Dekhs&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">courage culture was straightforward. It said the most important thing in terms of transforming</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzdc6Dekhs&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">your work into something that you're passionate about is having the courage to go after that thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzdc6Dekhs&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.480</a></span> | <span class="t">you love. So courage culture prioritizes courage as the key issue. So look, I'm going to draw a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzdc6Dekhs&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">picture here. And again, my apologies for people who are actually seeing this, but in courage</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzdc6Dekhs&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">culture, I'll draw this rough picture. What it's saying is, okay, the path, all right, so I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzdc6Dekhs&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">drawing a squiggly line here. At the end of the squiggly line is a person smiling. Jesse will tell</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzdc6Dekhs&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">you for the listeners, expertly drawn, holding their hands in the air triumphantly. And what is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzdc6Dekhs&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the obstacle here is you have this obstacle up front, this big, drew it as like a red squiggle,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzdc6Dekhs&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and it's fear. So this is a great illustration on the screen. So courage culture said, here's the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzdc6Dekhs&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">issue is if you can overcome that fear, which is built, and there's all sorts of sources of it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzdc6Dekhs&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">parental expectation, conformity to society, you can overcome that fear, you have a pretty easy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzdc6Dekhs&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">path to being very happy. So we have to build up courage to find happiness. I pushed back on this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzdc6Dekhs&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">as I went out there and I studied people who were very passionate about their careers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzdc6Dekhs&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and I studied their actual lives, not just what they said. And what I saw was a different picture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzdc6Dekhs&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So the path that they took, if you're looking at the screen now, you'll see this, the path they took</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzdc6Dekhs&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">was uphill. So now my picture, it's a pretty arduous uphill path, right? So it's like going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzdc6Dekhs&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">up a mountain. And so what is stopping them here? So what's in the way of this uphill path is an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzdc6Dekhs&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">expertly drawn brain. Oh God, I'm getting creative here, Jesse. An expertly drawn brain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzdc6Dekhs&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that is seen, oh man, changing colors, I'm really impressed by my drawing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzdc6Dekhs&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">is seen as drawn by these orange dots, the hardness of this path,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzdc6Dekhs&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and saying, okay, I'm going to preserve energy. Pretty good, right, Jesse?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzdc6Dekhs&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">- Yeah, it's great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzdc6Dekhs&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">- All right. So if you look at these two different interpretations, you get two different ways to go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzdc6Dekhs&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">forward. So courage culture says this first picture is what's happening. So you got to just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzdc6Dekhs&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">get really inspired. So you can have this moment of courage and overcome your fear. And once you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzdc6Dekhs&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">leap over to the other side, you have this easy path. There's waiting there all along,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzdc6Dekhs&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">just going to get you to happiness. This other approach, which I said was more realistic,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzdc6Dekhs&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">is the reason why you're hesitating to get going is that often it is really, really hard to get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzdc6Dekhs&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to this success with something really cool. And your brain recognizes that and it sees how hard</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzdc6Dekhs&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">it is. And it says, hey buddy, I like the guy at the top of the mountain with their hands in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzdc6Dekhs&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">air, but you're not ready to do this. You don't really understand how to hike this long. You</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzdc6Dekhs&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">don't know how your compass works. You don't have enough water. I checked your boots. They're pretty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzdc6Dekhs&t=316" target="_blank">00:05:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">bad. You haven't checked the weather. Do you have a jacket? And so your brain says, we're not going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzdc6Dekhs&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to engage on this long-term plan until I'm more confident that you know what the hell you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzdc6Dekhs&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">doing. Now, last week on the show, we got into the neuroscience of this. This actual process is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzdc6Dekhs&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">called episodic future thinking or EFT. It is your brain actually trying to project into the future</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzdc6Dekhs&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and understanding of what's going to happen based on your experience and expertise that you already</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzdc6Dekhs&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">have stored in your hippocampus and seeing what it projects. And if it likes what it projects,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzdc6Dekhs&t=347" target="_blank">00:05:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">then it's going to give you motivation. And if it doesn't, it's going to withhold it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzdc6Dekhs&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So if when your brain, the centers that are working on the EFT, the episodic future thinking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzdc6Dekhs&t=356" target="_blank">00:05:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">are looking at what you understand and your plans and your past experiences and says, you don't know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzdc6Dekhs&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">how to get up that proverbial mountain, you're not going to get motivation. So my approach was,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzdc6Dekhs&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">it's not about getting the courage to just go for it.

That's cool. We're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzdc6Dekhs&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">going to get up that mountain, that guy's hands in the air, that's going to be us, that ties to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQzdc6Dekhs&t=385" target="_blank">00:06:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">our values, let's get after it.
