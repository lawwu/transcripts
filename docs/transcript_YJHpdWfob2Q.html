The biggest use of energy comes from heating and cooling, for sure. If it's the middle summer and you're trying to stay cool and you like it 70 degrees, maybe try 72, maybe try 74.</p><p>Even just one degree of difference can actually knock your bill down 5%, 10%. The other thing you can do, if you live in an area, like I know in California you have time abuse rates, that's not everywhere, but if you really want to save a lot of money, shift how and when you're spending that money.</p><p>That energy. So for instance, in California, time use rates are super cheap overnight. What you can do is you could over air condition your house overnight and then basically turn the system off during the day and let your house gradually come back up to temperature. So you're not using any energy during the day when you're trying to stay cool because you pre-cooled your house overnight.</p><p>You're basically using your entire house as basically just a giant thermal battery.</p></div></div></body></html>
