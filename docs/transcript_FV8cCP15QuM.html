I mean, look, it's the difference between a good life and a bad life is, is who you surround yourself with. There is scientific evidence that shows that the people that you surround yourself with the people that create your environment are going to shape your outcomes in your reality.</p><p>There's a scientific effect called the Pygmalion effect, which says that we rise to the level of others expectations for us, or we fall to that level of expectations. So if you surround yourself with people who are encouraging you to think bigger, who believe in you, who are pushing you that you're capable of more than you're currently doing, you will naturally rise to that level of expectations, you will improve yourself.</p><p>So finding your way into those rooms, creating those communities, surrounding yourself with people who are embracing the fact that you have a dynamic potential as a human being can completely change your life.</p></div></div></body></html>
