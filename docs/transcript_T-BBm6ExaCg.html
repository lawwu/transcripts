Let's see what else we have here. I've got a question from DK. DK is asking if I have any suggestions on what habits to add and improve when going from a PhD to a postdoc. Postdocs are highly autonomous as compared to PhD programs. It's all about research.</p><p>Build your whole day around research. That's what it's about, is doing research, doing research well. You will find that you probably have more free time than you're used to. Because if all you're doing is research, there's only so much of you doing the research during the day. That's fine.</p><p>Just build a schedule that doesn't require as many hours. I'll tell you what I did, DK, when I switched from my doctoral work to my postdoctoral work, is I was looking ahead to when I was going to become a professor after being a postdoc. And I said, when I'm a professor, my time is going to be way more limited than it is right now as a postdoc.</p><p>I'm going to have classes. I'm going to have committees. I'm going to have students to supervise. And so I don't know-- in addition to practicing research as a postdoc, I want to practice being effective at doing research even if I have reduced time. So I added artificial constraints to my schedule.</p><p>I had a dog at this point. It lived about a mile from campus. I've talked about this before, across the bridge in Beacon Hill. And so I built a schedule where I'd start at 9, but I'd take a two-hour block out of the middle of every day, where I'd take my dog, Bailey.</p><p>We'd go for a run. We'd run from the East Campus there of MIT, down the Charles. We would go down to the Mass Avenue Bridge. We'd cross at the Mass Avenue Bridge, come running back on the Charles on the Boston side. We'd exercise calisthenics on one of the docks that's out in the Charles River off of that size.</p><p>And if it was winter, we would dig out a spot on that dock out of the snow to do our push-ups. We were hardcore about it. We'd do our pull-ups. And so we'd do this long run. Weather didn't matter. I had gear. Go back to my apartment on Beacon Hill.</p><p>I would have lunch. I would take a shower. And then I would walk back to campus, now crossing the Longfellow Bridge. This is like a two-hour-plus thing. But I wanted to put an artificial constraint in my day to say, OK, I not only need to get used to doing research, but getting a lot of research done when I only have a limited amount of time.</p><p>So I felt like I was training. I also wrote a book. So I wrote most of Sogo They Can't Ignore You during my postdoc as well. So that's what I would suggest. It's all about research. Get used to research, making progress on research. Don't worry about having too much time.</p><p>In fact, this is a good time to do something else so you can practice doing that research with some constraints. It's an awesome job, basically, DK. It doesn't pay well, but it's otherwise an awesome job. So enjoy it. (upbeat music) (upbeat music)</p></div></div></body></html>
