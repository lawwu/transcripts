There's this entrepreneur who I've invested in Matt. Matt reached out to the real founder of Netflix, Mark Randolph, and he got a fricking response back. And then Mark Randolph became his advisor. And then in the book that talks about the story of how Netflix was really founded by Mark Randolph.</p><p>There's a reference to Matt in the fricking book. And then I asked Mark Randolph, the founder of Netflix. I said, is Matt Morales really like, how do you connect with him? Is he someone who you really are advising over the years? He said, yeah, he just reached out to me and I care about entrepreneurs.</p><p>So I responded back to him. And in fact, I invested in his latest business Oasis and he's a good person. I go from one fricking email out of the blue, I think people are too intimidated to reach out and it's a problem. We should also be reaching out to strangers whose work we like on the internet and tell them why we like it because they're trying to establish a relationship with their audience too, and with people they care about.</p></div></div></body></html>
