And after I published a post about my trip to Bora Bora,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the first question from a dozen people was, "Well, that's cool.

But a lot of people will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.200</a></span> | <span class="t">react to this and be like, "Okay, but I don't have like $3,000 of stuff that I need to buy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.640</a></span> | <span class="t">We are on a pretty tight budget.

If you have a smaller budget, it's going to be really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">important to find some kind of source of reimbursable spend. And this can be as simple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">as you pay for dinner for a whole bunch of people and everybody Venmo's you back. That way you get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the points for putting the spend on your credit card, but it doesn't really affect your bank</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">account because other people are paying you back. You can plan parties. I know that we just talked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">on my podcast about you planned a whole bunch of bachelor parties for people in Mexico and got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">reimbursable spend that way. So you can earn a ton of points by doing that. You can put work travel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">on your card if your job allows it or any work-related expenses, and then just fill out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.640</a></span> | <span class="t">an expense report. If you're a teacher, we have an episode, I think it's episode 56,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">featuring Zach from Travel Freely. And he was a teacher and had a very small budget,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">but wanted to earn more points. But he was also the tennis coach at that school. So all of their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">team trips, he would just put it on his card and then fill out an expense report and get reimbursed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">for it. So finding some kind of reimbursable spend is really cool. One of the more advanced ways that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">people do this is through something called buying groups, which basically there are people who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">like to resale at scale. Think like PlayStations, Apple products, cell phones, things like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Most of the time, if there's a really good sale on an iPhone or an iPad, you're going to be limited</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">for how many you can buy. You can't just run into Best Buy and be like, give me all your iPads. I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">going to resell them right before Christmas, or give me all your PlayStation fives. I'm going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">price gouge everybody on eBay who wants this for Christmas for their kid. And so since you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">limited for how many you can buy, some people outsource the buying to other people where they'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.560</a></span> | <span class="t">say, hey, I am wanting to resell iPads. I'm offering this much. Get me an iPad, ship it to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=329" target="_blank">00:05:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">my place, and I will reimburse you. And so then you go out and source all of these different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.520</a></span> | <span class="t">electronics, ship it to their address, and they pay you back. So this is a way that some people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">in the points world get a lot of spend. There's lots of different channels that do this for buying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">groups. Some of them are like PFS, NYS Buyers Club, Buy For Me Retail. We have a whole master</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">class about the pros and cons of each one and where you can source all of these different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">products that you then ship to these different places. But the general mechanics are they put</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">out basically an ad that says, we're buying this. Here's how much we'll reimburse you for. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=372" target="_blank">00:06:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">you try to source that item at a lower cost so that you're not losing money and then ship it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=377" target="_blank">00:06:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">directly to them, and they'll pay you back. Do they usually pay more than it would cost?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=382" target="_blank">00:06:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's different ways that can be done. Some of them actually pay a pretty hefty commission.

I've gotten as high as 18%, I think, if it's like beauty salons</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=873" target="_blank">00:14:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and spas and stuff.

I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=879" target="_blank">00:14:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">earning points through Rakuten. And I get a Groupon discount. So that's one example of how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=885" target="_blank">00:14:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">you can stack things. I try not to go super crazy with stacking like 17 steps because that's 17</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=893" target="_blank">00:14:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">steps you have to track in each one. Like what if one thing goes wrong? But there's a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=897" target="_blank">00:14:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">different ways to automate the stacking. It's really easy to do this with restaurants. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=904" target="_blank">00:15:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you can sign up for airline dining portals, lots of different dining portals. So you just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=911" target="_blank">00:15:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">have to link any credit card that you want. And then when you dine at a partnered restaurant</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=916" target="_blank">00:15:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">with that credit card, then you're going to get extra points through this dining portal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=921" target="_blank">00:15:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So in New York, we have a lot of restaurants that are in this dining portal. We also have this app</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=928" target="_blank">00:15:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">called Seated where you make reservations through this app. You take a picture of your receipt</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=933" target="_blank">00:15:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">afterwards to make sure that your reservation is completed. And they will give you 23% back</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=942" target="_blank">00:15:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of the time, sometimes up to 60% back for dining. And if you can do this on a group dinner,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=947" target="_blank">00:15:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">oh, I think I made like $60 in one weekend because everybody else was from out of town.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=953" target="_blank">00:15:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there was the group bill. I took a picture of the full group receipt before we split it up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=959" target="_blank">00:15:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and earned $60 from some group dinners. So you can stack Seated, you can do the dining portal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=966" target="_blank">00:16:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Can you stack different dining portals? How does that work? I know. And for anyone not listening,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=971" target="_blank">00:16:11.120</a></span> | <span class="t">a listener, Harish, who's starting a podcast after all the... He heard all the hacks. He was like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=977" target="_blank">00:16:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">"I want to do this. It'll be called Hacking the American Dream." And he was like, "Do you talk</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=983" target="_blank">00:16:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">about dining portals? They're crazy." And so he sent me some screenshots from the Southwest Rapid</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=989" target="_blank">00:16:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Rewards Dining Portal. And he's like, "There's a bunch of restaurants.

If those intersect, that's great. But do you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=1004" target="_blank">00:16:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to pick one? Or can you say, "I'm going to do the American Dining Portal and the Rapid Rewards</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=1009" target="_blank">00:16:49.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Dining Portal and, and, and?" Normally, you can only choose one per card. So if I'm using my Amex</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=1016" target="_blank">00:16:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Gold to get 4x points on dining, I can only link that to one program because most of them are going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=1021" target="_blank">00:17:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">to go through the same central place and the same restaurants are on most of the networks. So you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=1027" target="_blank">00:17:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">can really just choose one, unfortunately. But you can link it with another app that's kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=1033" target="_blank">00:17:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">like a dining portal called DOSH, where it's the same idea. You just have to link up your credit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=1038" target="_blank">00:17:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">card and then go to a partnered restaurant or shop with a partnered store, pay with that linked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=1044" target="_blank">00:17:24.240</a></span> | <span class="t">credit card, and then you're going to get some points with DOSH as well. And for super, super</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=1049" target="_blank">00:17:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">stacks, Episode 7 of the Geo Breeze Travel Podcast features this girl named Angel Trinh.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=1056" target="_blank">00:17:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">You can find her on Instagram @pennywisetraveler.

She did like an Uber Eats credit, DOSH, Seated, Dining Portals. I think there was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=1073" target="_blank">00:17:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">like a Rakuten thing because she purchased a gift card to use at the restaurant there as well. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=1079" target="_blank">00:17:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">she was stacking so many different tactics for one dinner. So again, that's Episode 7 of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=1087" target="_blank">00:18:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Geo Breeze Travel Podcast. And that goes into a much more extreme example of how to stack things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=1093" target="_blank">00:18:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Awesome. Yeah, I have slowly inched my way into stacking. And the way I often do it is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=1099" target="_blank">00:18:19.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I use Cashback Monitor. So anytime Julia mentioned Rakuten, a lot of people know that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=1106" target="_blank">00:18:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">formerly known as Ebates is a portal you can earn cashback when you're shopping online.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=1111" target="_blank">00:18:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Anytime I'm going to make a purchase online that costs maybe over $100, I'll go look and say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=1118" target="_blank">00:18:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">"Is there cashback or points?"

And I was like, "Where can I get points?" And it turns out that, yeah, I could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=1149" target="_blank">00:19:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">get half an Emirates point per dollar or a few other places, but I get 3 JetBlue points per</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=1155" target="_blank">00:19:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">dollar.

And so one that a lot of people know about is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=1185" target="_blank">00:19:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">anytime you change your address, the USPS sends you a bunch of coupons to your new address.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=1191" target="_blank">00:19:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">There are websites that sell those coupons to save you the hassle of finding them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=1197" target="_blank">00:19:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so right before we purchased the couch on Crate & Barrel, stacking the JetBlue points,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=1204" target="_blank">00:20:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I went to this website, and it's called saveindeals.com.

It does not look like a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=1217" target="_blank">00:20:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">professional website.

My advice has always been, if you have a redemption</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=2837" target="_blank">00:47:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">in mind, it can be a really great deal.

So whenever someone says, "Oh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=2956" target="_blank">00:49:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">we'll charge you 3%," before the built card, it was like, "Oh, you can pay your rent, but you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=2961" target="_blank">00:49:21.280</a></span> | <span class="t">to pay fees with plastic or other services." I was always like, "It never makes sense to pay fees to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=2966" target="_blank">00:49:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">earn points." And then I just started digging into paying taxes on a credit card this year,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=2972" target="_blank">00:49:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and I'm not sure I agree anymore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=2975" target="_blank">00:49:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">It can be a really good way to meet minimum spend if you don't have another way to easily</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=2980" target="_blank">00:49:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">meet your minimum spend. So for example, the Amex Business Platinum has $15,000 minimum spend,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=2987" target="_blank">00:49:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">which is a lot.

I've seen 4%. What I realized was that the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=3060" target="_blank">00:51:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">fees to pay your taxes on a credit card are actually lower than I expected. So there are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=3066" target="_blank">00:51:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">3 sites the IRS shows.

And at the worst case, you can redeem</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=3083" target="_blank">00:51:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">your points, which you earn 2 of at 1 penny, booking travel. So 2 cents per dollar spent,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=3090" target="_blank">00:51:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">so 2% cash back.

I'm literally going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=3123" target="_blank">00:52:03.520</a></span> | <span class="t">make $13.

But some people do things like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=3210" target="_blank">00:53:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I definitely do not want to owe... Especially on a card that's a charge card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=3215" target="_blank">00:53:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe if it was a 0% APR card, you could carry it. But I did realize that if you're trying to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=3223" target="_blank">00:53:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">meet a minimum spend in 2022 at 1.87% on the right card, it has to be a card that's earning you 2%</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=3233" target="_blank">00:53:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">back or more. Otherwise, you'd be losing money.

Last few things. I got an email from a woman named Brandy,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=3245" target="_blank">00:54:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">who pointed out something that I didn't realize. I'm not in the military, nor is my spouse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=3252" target="_blank">00:54:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But I recently learned and wanted to share that if you have a Chase, an Amex, or a CityCard,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=3258" target="_blank">00:54:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and you are in the military or your spouse is in the military,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=3262" target="_blank">00:54:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">they will waive your annual fees on all the cards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbhznmaq0Bg&t=3265" target="_blank">00:54:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I looked at the list.
