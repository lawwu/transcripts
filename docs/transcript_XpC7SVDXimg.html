They won't do it. If somebody threatens to eliminate you, as Iran is doing today, and as Hitler did then, and people discounted it, well, if somebody threatens to annihilate us, take them seriously and act to prevent it early on. Don't let them have the means to do so, because that may be too late. The following is a conversation with Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister of Israel, currently serving his sixth term in office. He's one of the most influential, powerful, and controversial men in the world, leading a right-wing coalition government at the center of one of the most intense and long-lasting conflicts and crises in human history. As we spoke, and as I speak now, large-scale protests are breaking out all over Israel over this government's proposed judicial reform that seeks to weaken the Supreme Court in a bold accumulation of power. This is a conversation that I'm going to be talking about in a moment. Given the current intense political battles in Israel, our previous intention to speak for three hours was adjusted to one hour for the time being, but we agreed to speak again for much longer in the future. I will also interview people who harshly disagree with the words spoken in this conversation. I will speak with other world leaders, with religious leaders, with historians and activists, and with people who have lived and have suffered through the pain of war, destruction, and destruction. and loss that stoke the fires of anger and hate in their heart. For this, I will travel anywhere, no matter how dangerous, if there's any chance it may help add to understanding and love in the world. I believe in the power of conversation, to do just this, to remind us of our common humanity. I know I'm underqualified and underskilled for these conversations, so I will often fall short. And I will certainly get attacked, derided, and slandered. But I will always turn the other cheek and use these attacks to learn, to improve, and no matter what, never give in to cynicism. This life, this world of ours, is too beautiful not to keep trying. Trying to do some good, in whatever way each of us know how. I love you all. This is the Lex Friedman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors. In the description. And now, dear friends, here's Benjamin Netanyahu. You're loved by many people here in Israel and in the world, but you're also hated by many. In fact, I think you may be one of the most hated men in the world. So if there's a young man or a young woman listening to this right now who have such hate in their heart, what can you say to them to one day turn that hate into love? I disagree with it. I disagree with the premise of your question. I think I have enjoyed a very broad support around the world. There are certain corners in which we have this animosity that you describe, and it sort of permeates in some of the newspapers and news organs and so on in the United States. But it certainly doesn't reflect the broad support that I have. I just gave an interview on an Iranian channel. 16 million viewers. I gave another one. I just did a little video a few years ago. 25 million viewers from Iran. Certainly no hate there, I have to tell you. Not from the regime. And when I go around the world, and I've been around the world, people want to hear what we have to say, what I have to say as a leader of Israel, whom they respect increasingly as a rising power in the world. So I disagree with that. And the most important thing that goes against what you said is the respect that we receive from the Arab world and the fact that we've made four historic peace agreements with Arab countries. They made it with me. They didn't make it with anyone else. And I respect them and they respect me. And probably more to come. So I think the premise is wrong. That's all. Well, there's a lot of love, yes. A lot of leaders. A lot of people are collaborating. Respect, I said. Okay, all right. Well, it's a spectrum. But there is people who don't have good things to say about Israel, who do have hate in their heart for Israel. Yeah. And what can you say to those people? Well, I think they don't know very much. I think they're guided by a lot of ignorance. They don't know about Israel. They don't know that Israel is a stellar democracy, that it happens to be one of the most intense, advanced societies on the planet, that what Israel develops helps humanity in every field, in medicine, in agriculture, in the environment, in telecoms, and talk about AI in a minute, but changing the world for the better, and spreading this among six continents. We've sent rescue teams more than any other country in the world, and we're one-tenth of one percent of the world's population. But when there's an earthquake or a devastation in Haiti or in the Philippines, Israel is there. When there's an earthquake, a devastating earthquake in Turkey, Turkey, Israel was there. When there's something in Nepal, Israel is there. And it's a second country. It's the second country after, in one case, India, or after, in another case, the United States, Israel is there. Tiny Israel is a benefactor to all of humanity. So you're a student of history. You just linger on that philosophical notion of hate, that part of human nature. If you look at World War II, what do you learn from human nature, from the rise of the Third Reich, and the rise of somebody like Hitler, and the hate that permeates that? Well, what I've learned is that you have to nip bad things in the bud. You have to--there's a Latin term that says, "Obstaprincipi." You have to stop bad things when they're small. And the deliberate hatred, the incitement of hatred against one community, its demonization, delegitimization that goes with it, is a very dangerous thing. And that happened in the case of the Jews. What started with the Jews soon spread to all of humanity. So what we've learned is that's what we should--we should never, sit aside and say, "Oh, they're just threatening to destroy us. They won't do it." If somebody threatens to eliminate you, as Iran is doing today, and as Hitler did then, and people discounted it, well, if somebody threatens to annihilate us, take them seriously and act to prevent it early on. Don't let them have the means to do so, because that may be too late. So in those threats underlying that hatred, how much of it is anti-Zionism and how much of it is anti-Semitism? I don't distinguish between the two. You can't say, "Well, I'm okay with Jews, but I just don't think there should be a Jewish state." It's like saying, "I'm not anti-American. I just don't think there should be an America." That's basically what people are saying vis-Ã -vis anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism. When you say anti-Zionism, you're saying that Jewish people don't have a right to have a state of their own. And that is a denial of-- of a basic--a basic principle that, I think, completely unmasks what is involved here. Today, anti-Semitism is anti-Zionism. Those who oppose the Jewish people oppose the Jewish state. If we jump from human history to the current particular moment, there's protests in Israel now about the proposed judicial reform that gives power to your government to override the Supreme Court. So the critics say that this gives too much power to you, virtually making you a dictator. Yeah, well, that's ridiculous. The mere fact that you have so many demonstrations and protests, some dictatorship, huh? There's a lot of democracy here, more rambunctious and more robust than just anywhere on the planet. Can you steel man the case that this gives-- this may give too much power to the coalition government to the prime minister, not just to you, but to those who follow? No, I think that's complete hogwash, because I think there's a-- there's a--very few people who are demonstrating against this. Quite a few, quite many don't have an idea what is being discussed. They're basically being sloganized. You can sloganize--you know something about, not mass media right now, but the social network. You can basically feed, deliberately, with big data and big money, you can just feed slogans and get into people's minds. I'm sure you don't think I exaggerate, because you can tell me more about that. And you can create mass mobilization based on these absurd slogans. So here's where I come from and what we're doing, what we're trying to do, and what we've changed in what we're trying to do. I'm a 19th century Democrat in my-- small d, yes--in my views. That is, I view--I ask the question, "What is democracy?" Okay? So democracy is the will of the majority and the protection of the rights of-- they call it the rights of the minority, but I say the rights of the individual. Okay? So how do you balance the two? Okay? How do you get the--how do you avoid mobocracy? Okay? And how do you avoid dictatorship, the opposite side? The way you avoid it is something that was built, essentially, by British philosophers and French philosophers, but-- was encapsulated by the founding fathers of the United States. You create a balance between the three branches of government. Okay? The legislative, the executive, and the judiciary. And this balance is what assures the balance between majority rights and individual rights. And you have to balance all of them. Okay. That balance was maintained in Israel in its first 50 years and was gradually overtaken. And basically broken by the most activist judicial court on the planet. That's what happened here. And gradually over the last two, three decades, the court arrogated for itself the powers of the parliament and the executive. So we're trying to bring it back into line. Bringing it back into line into what is common in all parliamentary democracies and in the United States doesn't mean taking the pendulum from one side and bringing it to the other side. We want checks and balances, not unrivaled power. Just as we said, we want an independent judiciary, but not an all-powerful judiciary. That balance does not mean bringing it back into line. Doesn't mean that you can have the parliament, our Knesset, override any decision that the Supreme Court does. So I pretty much early on said, after the judicial reform was introduced, get rid of the idea of sweeping override clause that would have with 61 votes, that's a majority of one, you can just nullify any Supreme Court decision. So let's move it back into the center. So that's gone. And most of the criticism on the judicial reform was based on an unlimited override clause, which I've said is simply not going to happen. People are discussing something that already for six months does not exist. The second point that we received criticism on was the structure of how do you choose Supreme Court judges? How do you choose them? And the critics of the reform are saying that the idea that elected officials should choose Supreme Court judges is the end of democracy. If that's the case, the United States is not a democracy. Neither is France. And now there are just, I don't know, just about every democracy on the planet. So there is a view here that you can't have the sorted hands of elected officials involved in the choosing of judges. And in the Israeli system, the judicial activism went so far that effectively the sitting judges have an effective veto on choosing judges, which means that this is a self-selecting court that just perpetrates itself. And we want to correct that. Again, we want to correct it in a balanced way. And that's basically what we're trying to do. So I think there's a lot of misinformation about that. We're trying to bring Israeli democracy to where it was its first 50 years. And it was a stellar democracy. It still is. Israel is a democracy, will remain a democracy, a vibrant democracy. And believe me, the fact that people are arguing and demonstrating in the streets and protesting is just the best proof of that. And that's how it will remain. We spoke about tech companies offline. There's a lot of tech companies nervous about this judicial reform. Can you speak to why? Why do large and small companies have a future in Israel? Because Israel is a free market economy. I had something to do with that. I introduced dozens and dozens of free market reforms that made Israel move from $17,000 per capita income to within a very short time to $54,000. That's nominal GDP per capita, according to the IMF. And we've overtaken in that Japan, France, Britain, Germany, and how did that happen? Because we unleashed the genius that we have and the initiative and the entrepreneurship that is latent in our population. And to do that, we had to create free markets. So we created that. So Israel has one of the most vibrant free market economies in the world. And the second thing we have is a permanent investment in conceptual products because we have a permanent investment in the military and our security services. Creating basically knowledge workers who then become knowledge entrepreneurs. And so we create this structure. And that's not going to go away. There's been a decline in investments in high tech globally. I think that's driven by many factors, but the most important one is the interest rate, which I think will fluctuate up and down. But Israel will remain a very attractive country because it produces so many, so many knowledge workers and so many people. And so we have to create a knowledge based economy. And it's changing so rapidly. The world is changing. You're looking for the places that have innovation. The future belongs to those who innovate. Israel is the preeminent innovation nation. It has few competitors. And I would say, all right, where do you have this close, cross-disciplinary fermentation in Israel? And I'll tell you why. We used to be just telecoms because people went out of the military intelligence, RNSA. But that's been now broad-based. So you find it in medicine. You find it in biology. You find it in agri-tech. You find it everywhere. Everything is becoming technologized. And in Israel, everybody is dealing in everything. And that's a potent reservoir of talent that the world is not going to pass up. So we have a new plant that's coming to us. We just had Nvidia coming here. And they decided to build a supercomputer in Israel. I wonder why. We've had Intel coming here and deciding now to invest $25 billion just now in a new plant in Israel. I wonder why. I don't wonder why. They know why. Because the talent is here and the freedom is here. Then it will remain so. - So you had a conversation about AI with Sam Altman of OpenAI and with Elon Musk. What's the content of that conversation? What's your vision for sort of this very highest of tech, which is artificial intelligence? - Well, first of all, I have a high regard for the people I talk to, okay? And I understand that they understand things I don't understand. And I don't pretend to understand everything. But I do understand one thing. I understand that AI is developing at a geometric rate. And mostly in political, life and in life in general, people don't have an intuitive grasp of geometric growth. You understand things basically in linear increments. And the idea that you're coming up a ski slope is very foreign to people. So they don't understand it. And they're naturally also sort of taken aback by it. Because what do you do? Okay? So I think there's several conclusions from my conversations with them and from my experience with other observations that I've been talking about for many years. I'm talking about the need to do this. Well, the first thing is this. There is no possibility of not entering AI with full force. Secondly, there is a need for regulation. Third, it's not clear there'll be global regulation. Fourth, it's not clear where it ends up. I certainly cannot say that. Now you might say, does it come to control us? Okay, that's a question. Does it come to control us? I don't know the answer to that. I think that as one observation that I had from these conversations is if it does come to control us, that's probably the only chance of having universal regulation because I don't see anyone deciding to, you know, avoid the race and cooperate unless you have that threat. It doesn't mean you can't regulate AI within countries even without that understanding, but it does mean that there's a limit to regulation because every country will want to make sure that it's not -- doesn't give up competitive advantage if there is no universal regulation. I think that right now, just as, you know, 10 years ago, I read a novel. I don't read novels, but I was forced to read one by a scientist or a scientific advisor. I read history. I read about economics. I read about technology. I just don't read novels. Okay. And this time, I followed Churchill. You know, he said, "Fact is better than fiction." Well, this fiction would become fact. And it was a book. It was a novel about a Chinese-American future cyber war. And I read the book in one sitting, called in a team of experts, and I said, "All right, let's turn Israel into one of the world's five cyber powers, and let's do it very quickly." And we did, actually. We did exactly that. I think AI is bigger than that and related to that because it'll affect -- well, cyber affects everything, but AI will affect it even more fundamentally, and the joining of the two could be very powerful. So I think in Israel, we have to do it anyway for security reasons, and we're doing it. But I think what about -- what about our databases that are already very robust on the medical records of 98% of our population? Why don't we stick a genetic database on that? Why don't we do other things that could bring magical -- what are seemingly magical cures and drugs and medical instruments for that? That's one possibility. We have it in, as I said, in every single field. The conclusion is this. We have to move on AI. We are moving on AI just as we moved on cyber, and I think Israel will be one of the leading -- one of the leading AI powers in the world. The questions I don't have an answer to is, where does it go? How much does it eat, chew up on jobs? There's an assumption that I'm not sure is true that all previous -- the two big previous -- revolutions in the human condition, namely the agricultural revolution and the industrial revolution, definitely produced more jobs than they consumed. Okay? That is not obvious to me at all. I mean, I could see new jobs creating, and yes, I have that comforting statement, but it's not quite true, because I think on balance, they'll probably consume more jobs, many more jobs, than they'll create. At least in the short term. And we don't know about the long term. No, I don't know about the long term, but I used to have the comfort, being a free market guy, I always said, you know, we're going to produce more jobs than, you know, by, I don't know, limiting certain government jobs. We're actually putting out in the market, we'll create more jobs, which obviously happened. You know, we had one telecom company, a government company, when I said we're going to, you know, we're going to create competition, they said, you're going to run us out. We're not going to have more workers. Yeah, they had 13,000 workers. They went down to seven, but we created another 40,000 in the other companies. So that was a comforting thought. I always knew that was true. Okay. Not only that, I also knew that wealth would spread by opening up the markets, completely opposite to the socialist and semi-socialist creed that they had here. They said, you're going to make the rich richer and the poor, poor, no, and made everyone richer. And actually, the people who entered the job market because of the reforms we did actually became a lot richer on the lower ladders of the socioeconomic measure. But here's the point. I don't know. I don't know that we will not have what Elon Musk calls the end of scarcity. So you'll have the end of scarcity. You'll have enormous productivity. You know, very few people are producing enormous added value. You're going to have to tax that to pass it to the others. Okay. You're going to have to do that. That's a political question. I'm not sure how we answer that. What if you tax and somebody else doesn't tax, you're going to get everybody to go there. That's an issue, an international issue that we constantly have to deal with. And the second question you have is, suppose you solve that problem and you deliver money. Okay. To those who are not involved in the AI economy, what do they do? The first question you ask somebody whom you just met after the polite exchanges is, what do you do? Right? Well, people define themselves by their profession. And it's going to be difficult if you don't have a profession. And people will spend more time self-searching, more time in the, in the arts, more time in leisure. I understand that. If I have to bet, it will annihilate many more jobs than it will create and it will force a structural change in our economics, in our economic models and in our politics. And I'm not sure where it's going to go. And that's something we have to respond to at the nation level and just as a human civilization. Both the threat of AI to just us as a human species, and then the effect on the jobs, and like you said, cyber security. And what do you think? You think it's going to, we're going to lose control? No. First of all, I do believe, maybe naively, that it will create more jobs than it takes. Write that down and we'll check it. It's on record. And you know, we don't have, we don't say we'll check it after our lifetime. No, we'll see it in a few years. We'll see it in a few years. I'm really concerned about cyber security and the nature of how that changes with the power of AI. And in terms of existential threats, I think there will be so much threats that aren't existential along the way that that's the thing I'm mostly concerned about versus AI taking complete control and becoming sort of superseding the human species. Although that is something you should consider seriously because of the exponential growth of its capabilities. It's exactly the exponential growth which we understand is before us, but we don't know what it is. And so, we have to think about it before us, but we don't really, it's very hard to project forward. Yeah, to really understand. That's right. Exactly right. So, you know, I deal with what I can and where I can affect something. I tend not to worry about things I don't control because at a certain point, you know, there's no point. I mean, you have to decide what you're spending your time on. So, I think in practical terms, I think we'll make Israel a formidable AI power. We understand the limitation of scale, computing power, and other things. But I think within those limits, I think we can make here this miracle that we did in many other things. You know, we do more with less. I don't care if it's water, the production of water, or the production of energy, or the production of knowledge, or the production of cyber capabilities, defense and other. We just do more with less. And I think in AI, we're going to do a lot more with relatively small but highly gifted population. Very gifted. - So, taking a small tangent, as we talked about offline, you have a background in Taekwondo. - Oh, yeah. - Yeah. We mentioned Elon Musk. I've trained with both. Just as a quick question, who do you have, who are you betting on in a fight? - Well, I refuse to answer that. I will say this. - Such a politician you are. - Yeah, of course. Here I'm a politician. I'm openly telling you, then I'm dodging the question, okay? But I'll say this. You know, I actually, I spent five years in our special forces in the military, and we barely spent a minute on martial arts. I actually learned Taekwondo later when I came to, it wasn't even at MIT. At MIT, I think I did karate, but when I came to the UN, I had a martial arts expert and he taught me Taekwondo, which was kind of interesting. Now, the question you really have to ask is, why did we learn martial arts in this special elite unit? And the answer is, there's no point. If you saw Indiana Jones, you know, there's no point. You just, you know, pull the trigger. That's simple. Now, I don't expect anyone to pull the trigger on this combat, and I'm sure you'll make sure that doesn't happen. - I'm sure you'll make sure that doesn't happen. - Yeah. - I'm sure you'll make sure that doesn't happen. - Yeah. - I'm sure you'll make sure that doesn't happen. - Yeah. - I'm sure you'll make sure that doesn't happen. - Yeah. I mean, martial arts is this kind of, it's bigger than just combat. It's this kind of journey of humility, and it has, it's an art form. It truly is an art. But it's fascinating that these two figures in tech are facing each other. And I won't ask a question of who you would face and how you would do, but. - Well, I'm facing opponents all the time. - All the time? - Yeah, that's part of life. - But not of each. - Part of life is, you know, I'm not saying that I'm not a professional, but I'm not a professional in the martial arts world. - Yeah. - But I'm not saying that you're not a professional in the martial arts world. - But not of each. - You know, part of life, part of life is, - Not yet. - I'm not sure about that. - Are you announcing invites? - No. - Okay. - No, no, no. Part of life is competition. You know, the only time competition ends is death. But, you know, political life, economic life, cultural life is engaged continuously in creativity and competition. And the problem I have with that, as I mentioned earlier, just before we began the podcast, is that, you know, I'm not saying that I'm not a professional. I'm not saying that I'm not a professional. I'm not saying that I'm not a professional. What I'm saying is, is that, at a certain point, you want to put barriers to monopoly. And if you're a really able competitor, you're gonna create a monopoly. That's what Peter Thiel says is a natural course of things. It's what I learned in basically in the Boston Consulting Group. If you're a very able competitor, you'll create scale advantages that give you the ability to lock out your competition. And as a prime minister, I want to assure that there is competition in the markets. You have to limit, limit this competitive power at a certain point. And that becomes increasingly hard in the world where everything is intermixed. Where do you define market segments? Where do you define monopoly? How do you do that? That is very, that actually conceptually, I find very challenging. Because of all the dozens of political, of economic reforms that I've made, the most difficult part is the conceptual part. Why? Because once you have, you've ironed it out, you say, here's what I want to do, here's the right thing to do, then you have a practical problem of overcoming union resistance, political resistance, press calumny, opponents from this or that corner. That's a practical matter. But if you have it conceptually defined, you can move ahead to reform economies or reform education or reform transportation. Fine. And the question of the growing power of large companies, big tech companies to monopolize the markets because they're better at it. They provide a service, they provide it at lower cost, at rapidly declining cost. Where do you stop? Where do you stop monopoly power is a crucial question because it also becomes now a political question. If you amass enormous amount of economic power, which is information power, that also monopolizes the political process, which creates, these are real questions that are not obvious. I don't have an obvious answer because as I said, as a 19th century democrat, these are questions of the 21st century which people should begin to think. Do you have a solution to that? The solution of monopoly is growing arbitrarily, unstoppably in power. Economic power and therefore in political power. I mean, some of that is very clear. I mean, I think that's the question that's very clear. I think that's the question that's very clear. I think that's the question that's very clear. I think that's the question that's very clear. I mean, some of that is regulation. Some of that is competition. You know where? To draw the line? It's not breaking up AT&T, you know, it's not that simple. Well, I believe in the power of competition that there will always be somebody that challenges the big guys. Especially in the space of AI, the more open source movements are taking hold, the more the little guy can become the big guy. So you're saying basically the regulatory, the regulatory is the market. In large part, in most part. That's the hope. Maybe I'm a dreamer. That's been in many ways my policy up to now. Okay? That the best regulator is the market. The best regulator in economic, in economic activity is the market. And the best regulator in political matters is the political market. That's called elections. That's what, that's what regulation is. And the best regulator in political matters is the political market. That's called elections. That's what, that's what regulation is. And the best regulator in political matters is the political market. That's what regulation is. You know, you have a lousy government and people make lousy decisions. Well, you don't need, you know, the wise men raised above the, you know, the, the masses to decide what is good and what is bad. Let the masses decide. Let them vote every four years or whatever.
