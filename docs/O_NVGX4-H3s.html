this so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_NVGX4-H3s&t=129" target="_blank">00:02:09.960</a></span> | <span class="t">they they set up a few

doing this is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_NVGX4-H3s&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">current benchmark

target="_blank">00:02:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">correct is the answer correct and like that's cool but what we also want to know is how efficient our</span></div><div class="c"><span

reasoning paper so they have models both dense and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_NVGX4-H3s&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">reasoning models uh typically a lot of r1 and v3 and then cloud 3.7 thinking and cloud 3.7 dense they have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_NVGX4-H3s&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">them solve these puzzles and they look at the internal reasoning states and then they basically analyze</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_NVGX4-H3s&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.380</a></span> | <span class="t">those and see okay how efficient are they how many tokens are they using where do they fall off</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_NVGX4-H3s&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">uh across these puzzles so they show that frontier large reasoning models face a complete a complete</span></div><div class="c"><span

kind of counterintuitive scaling them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_NVGX4-H3s&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">this is where the paper started to get it's like oh man apple is making big claims they're basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_NVGX4-H3s&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">saying that uh test time compute scaling doesn't really work at inference and pldr what they show is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_NVGX4-H3s&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">for easy puzzles um you know both models succeed so reasoning models and non-reasoning models both pass the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_NVGX4-H3s&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">puzzles but regular models are more efficient right they don't need to reason they don't use as many tokens</span></div><div class="c"><span

scale puzzles and stuff</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_NVGX4-H3s&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the reasoning models do better than dense models as we would expect and yeah they take more tokens but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_NVGX4-H3s&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">you know they can actually come they can actually complete their task and then their their key takeaway</span></div><div class="c"><span

of this um power of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_NVGX4-H3s&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">you know a moving game right so it's easy puzzle would be this game with only like one or two blocks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_NVGX4-H3s&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">right if there's only one block all you have to do is just move the block two times when you have two</span></div><div class="c"><span

increase complexity and they kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_NVGX4-H3s&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">of mathematically show as you add n blocks how the complexity of these puzzles increases so when you go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_NVGX4-H3s&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">from low complexity like one to three blocks base models are better uh when you go the medium</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_NVGX4-H3s&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">complexity reasoning models can figure it out where regular models can and then when you go to super</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_NVGX4-H3s&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">hard complexity like 10 15 blocks and tower of hinoi um that's where both models completely collapse and</span></div><div class="c"><span

of this so um let's just skip ahead</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_NVGX4-H3s&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.000</a></span> | <span

get to medium complexity the thinking model still performs it still has high accuracy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_NVGX4-H3s&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and the non-thinking models start to struggle and then this is kind of their takeaway at the end</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

kind of give</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_NVGX4-H3s&t=404" target="_blank">00:06:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">it so it's kind of

target="_blank">00:06:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">that they show and they they basically like this last paragraph here they basically like this paper could be two paragraphs but they want to

and then three is high complexity tasks where both models have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_NVGX4-H3s&t=450"

target="_blank">00:07:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">okay then the kind of other main point of this paper is they want to once again show that um you know current benchmarks emphasize final

reasoning traces and you know structure and quality of how well they think so their puzzle experiments kind of show this um cool let's continue on so the models they kind of do they don't use open

target="_blank">00:08:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">i.e it is easy if non reasoning does well i yeah they kind of just define it as you know easy less complex task medium complex task and then really hard task and they do have a mathematical definition for this so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_NVGX4-H3s&t=522"

the complexity can be controlled by the number of checker jumps</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_NVGX4-H3s&t=550"

of interesting little puzzle experiments here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_NVGX4-H3s&t=566" target="_blank">00:09:26.320</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_NVGX4-H3s&t=574" target="_blank">00:09:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">do pretty good charts and explanations of how this stuff works so on one end they've

right so um</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_NVGX4-H3s&t=610" target="_blank">00:10:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">not only performance but
