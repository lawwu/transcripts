One of the examples that I experienced was our four-year-old resisting going to school. She really just fought it.</p><p>She did not want to go into the classroom. She was not excited when she'd wake up. So instead of trying to quickly fix the problem, we approached her from a place of curiosity, just trying to understand more of the behavior. So help us understand, like, why don't you want to go to school?</p><p>What's happening right now? Tell me more. And I think what we realized is not that she didn't like school. She was actually bored. She didn't feel like she was being challenged. And that really allowed us to figure out ways that we could help integrate some of that into her next school year to ensure that she was feeling challenged in the right way.</p><p>And now she loves school. So I think to approaching it from a place of curiosity as opposed to any kind of judgment and having that open mind allows us and her to really collaborate and come up with a solution together.</p></div></div></body></html>
