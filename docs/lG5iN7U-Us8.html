This is so crucial for people to see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG5iN7U-Us8&t=48" target="_blank">00:00:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">God is radically God-centered in the Bible. God is radically God-exalting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG5iN7U-Us8&t=57" target="_blank">00:00:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's all over the Bible. He created us in His image. He put seven billion images of Himself in the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG5iN7U-Us8&t=66" target="_blank">00:01:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Why would a person put seven billion images of himself in a city?

And people laugh and say, "That's not the right answer for why you bring your wife roses on your anniversary."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG5iN7U-Us8&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The right answer is, "I couldn't help myself, Noelle. I love doing things for you. Nothing makes me happier than for me to spend the evening with you."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG5iN7U-Us8&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And she doesn't respond by saying, "You're so selfish. All you ever think about is yourself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG5iN7U-Us8&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because you said nothing ever makes you happier than to spend the evening with me."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG5iN7U-Us8&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">She doesn't respond like that because she knows when I enjoy her, she is honored.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG5iN7U-Us8&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's exactly the way it is with God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG5iN7U-Us8&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So God is most glorified. I could say at that moment, "Noelle is most honored by me when I'm most satisfied in her this evening."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG5iN7U-Us8&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I say on Sunday morning, "God is most glorified in me when I'm most satisfied in Him."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG5iN7U-Us8&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, what I'm always on the lookout for, Tony, is texts that more or less make that explicit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG5iN7U-Us8&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And here's one I haven't used before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG5iN7U-Us8&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I was reading this recently in 2 Corinthians 12, where Paul has this thorn in the flesh and he pleads three times for God to take it away.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG5iN7U-Us8&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And God says, Jesus says to Paul in 2 Corinthians 12, 9, "My grace is sufficient for you, and my power is made perfect in weakness."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG5iN7U-Us8&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So my power is glorified and magnified and beautified and made perfect in weakness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG5iN7U-Us8&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then Paul says, "Therefore, I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG5iN7U-Us8&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, doesn't that say, if I can be glad in the midst of my thorn, in the midst of my weakness or my hardship, then Christ will be magnified in me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG5iN7U-Us8&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's exactly what I'm trying to say in Christian hedonism and desiring God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG5iN7U-Us8&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We exist to proclaim that Christ is most magnified in me when I'm most satisfied in Him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG5iN7U-Us8&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then he says it, I think, almost explicit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG5iN7U-Us8&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He says in verse 10, "For the sake of Christ, then, I am content with weaknesses."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG5iN7U-Us8&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, content means satisfied and peaceful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG5iN7U-Us8&t=305" target="_blank">00:05:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I am so content and so satisfied in the grace that he says is sufficient for me, that I am now, for his sake, displaying his glory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG5iN7U-Us8&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I think the structure of Paul's thought in verses 9 and 10 of 2 Corinthians is exactly what we're trying to say at Desiring God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG5iN7U-Us8&t=328" target="_blank">00:05:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG5iN7U-Us8&t=333" target="_blank">00:05:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is the key for how God can be so God-exalting and yet a God of love, because he is as committed to my being satisfied in Him as he is to his being glorified in me, which is simply amazing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG5iN7U-Us8&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, that is simply amazing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
