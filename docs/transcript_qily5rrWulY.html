So if I were like charging, I don't really enjoy the same way. It's like, I don't know. It's like, it's like completely independent, which is necessary for me. Like, I think I have to be completely independent in some way of like my actual preferences in order to do it.</p><p>If I were actually checking in with like, what do I want in this moment? I'd probably be like, I don't want to be here. I don't want to be fucking a stranger. So like, it's like, I just can't let that in at all.</p></div></div></body></html>
