Business cards are pretty lucrative. Like there are a lot of great cards with great earning and really great welcome bonuses and even welcome bonuses with really low annual fees or no annual fees. And the qualification for a business card does not mean you own a profitable business.</p><p>It could mean you have any type of business income or a business plan or, you know, let's say you have a blog that you're looking to start in the future and it might become a business. Let's say you've done some consulting. You've sold something on eBay, you know, Etsy store.</p><p>Like if you do anything that could be considered business activity that's not working for an employer, I think business cards are pretty lucrative. And if you go to our website and click on cards at the top, there's a list of all the card offers and the best card offers are often business card offers.</p><p>So something to consider.</p></div></div></body></html>
