It's hard to imagine an innovation that did more to like flatten distance in the book, right? Now you can like read stuff that people are saying hundreds of miles away. And yet there's not a shred of evidence that the book led to less urbanization in Europe or to less connection.</p><p>It helped create a totally different world in which people were passionate about ideas and wanted to talk to each other. And they wanted to talk to each other about their books. And then, you know, flash forward 350 years and we have the telephone. And again, telephones started being used more in cities and they started being, they were used mostly by people who were going to meet face to face.</p><p>And again, no evidence that this has created, you know, a decline in the demand for face-to-face contact or a decline in the demand for cities. So I think if we look at Zoom, which unquestionably has allowed a certain amount of long distance contact, that's very, very useful. My guess is in the long run, it's probably going to be likely to be neutral at worst for face-to-face contact in the cities that enable that contact.</p></div></div></body></html>
