I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=96" target="_blank">00:01:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">want to discuss prompts and building good prompts, the different parts of a prompt and how we apply</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">them to large language models. Now when we think of large language models there are a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">different use cases that they are used for. We see things like creative writing, question answering,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">text summarization, data extraction, like a ton of these completely different things and with each of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">these different tasks we're not actually doing anything different in terms of the model. The</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">models are all the same for each one of these tasks. The difference is the prompts themselves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Now what do these prompts look like? Well we can typically break them apart into a few components.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have the instructions of a prompt, any external information or we can also call these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">contexts quite commonly as well. We would also have the user input or a query and we can also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">prime our prompt with what we call an output indicator and this is usually just a little word</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">at the end. Now not all prompts require all of these components but often a good prompt will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">use one or more of them. So starting with instructions. Instructions tell the model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">what to do and this is a very key part of more instruction based models like OpenAI's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Text DaVinci 003 and through these instructions we try to define what we would like the model to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and that means how it should use some inputs and how it should format outputs and what it should</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">consider whilst it's going through that process and we would always put these instructions at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.560</a></span> | <span class="t">the very top of our prompt. I'll explain a little bit more about that pretty soon. Following this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">we have our external information or contexts and these are additional parts of information that we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">feed into the model via the prompt. These can be things that we manually insert into the prompt,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">information that we pull in through a long-term memory component, a vector database or we get it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">through other means like a web search API or a calculator API, something along those lines.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Following that we have our user input. Now that's pretty obvious that's just the input from a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">particular user. It depends on what you're doing like if you have a text summarization use case</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">they might input a two-page chunk of text and we might want to summarize that into a paragraph</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">or on the other side maybe it's a question answering tool and in that case the user might</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">just type in a few words and question mark and that is their question, that is their user input.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So of course that can vary as well. Then finally we have our output indicator this is essentially</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">the start of what we would like the model to begin generating. So it is it's kind of like a way of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">indicating to the model hey okay now it's time for you to start you know writing something and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I want you to start writing something based on this first little chunk of text. So a good example</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">or very clear example at least in my view is when you have code generation model you want it to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">generate python code you know you give instructions to do so then your output indicator will just be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">the word import all in lowercase because most python scripts will actually begin with the word</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">import because you're going to be importing your libraries like import numpy and so on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">On the other hand if you were building like a conversational chatbot this output indicator</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=316" target="_blank">00:05:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">might be like the name of the chatbot followed by a colon as if you're sort of in a chat log.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay so they're the four main components of a prompt that we're going to talk about and that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=329" target="_blank">00:05:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">we're going to actually use to construct our prompts throughout this video. Okay so let's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=334" target="_blank">00:05:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">have a look at an example here we have the sort of our prompt up here this is the instruction okay</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">so that's right at the top of the prompt answer the question based on the context below if the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">question cannot be answered using the information provided to answer with I don't know. Okay so this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">is a form of conservative Q&A so given a question a user question we want the model to answer based</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">only on information that we can verify. Okay and that verified information is something that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">is our external information here our context that is also fed into the prompt right and we're saying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=372" target="_blank">00:06:12.720</a></span> | <span class="t">if that information is not contained within this context here or we'll probably usually have a list</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=378" target="_blank">00:06:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">of context I want you to say I don't know.

So we have our instructions we have our external</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">information or the context then we have user query which is down here okay so the question</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=400" target="_blank">00:06:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">which libraries and model providers offer LLMs and then we have that final bit is that output</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=407" target="_blank">00:06:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">indicator so this is like okay now you can start answering the question.

Okay so once</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=480" target="_blank">00:08:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">you have authenticated with that we're going to generate from that prompt that we just created.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=485" target="_blank">00:08:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay so all we do is we go to completion endpoint create we're using the text DaVinci</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=490" target="_blank">00:08:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">003 model it's one of the most recent instructional models and then we print out the response which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=498" target="_blank">00:08:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">will be in this path of the JSON returned.

this with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=1278" target="_blank">00:21:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the context string and then if we come down to here i'm also going to add in our max tokens</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=1284" target="_blank">00:21:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">great and let's run that okay cool so the question we'll just go up to the top here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=1295" target="_blank">00:21:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">uh answer the question based on the context below and then answer i don't know if it doesn't know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=1300" target="_blank">00:21:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the answer you know same as before uh give me two examples of how to use openai's gpt3 model using</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=1308" target="_blank">00:21:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">python from start to finish okay so what we have is two options we can either use it via openai</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

did it need those can we do this prompt without context and still get a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP9fi_0XTlw&t=1328"
