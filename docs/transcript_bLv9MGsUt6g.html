You boil things down to the most fundamental truths and say, "Okay, what are we sure is true?" And then reason up from there. Somebody could say, in fact people do, that battery packs are really expensive and that's just the way they'll always be because that's the way they've been in the past. No, that's pretty dumb. If you apply that reasoning to anything new, you wouldn't be able to ever get to that new thing. So first principles would be to say, "Okay, what are the material constituents of the batteries? What is the spot market value of the material constituents?" So you can say, "Okay, it's got cobalt, nickel, aluminum, carbon, and some polymers for separation and a steel can. If we bought that in London Metal Exchange, what would each of those things cost?" Like, "Oh, it's like $80 per kilowatt hour." So clearly you just need to think of clever ways to take those materials and combine them into the shape of a battery cell and you can have batteries that are much, much cheaper than anyone realizes.</p></div></body></html>
