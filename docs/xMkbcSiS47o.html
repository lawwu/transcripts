Now agents SDK if you don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=7" target="_blank">00:00:07.340</a></span> | <span class="t">already know is OpenAI's new AI framework and when I talk about voice I am speaking about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=15" target="_blank">00:00:15.220</a></span> | <span class="t">building a voice interface with which you communicate with your agents. Now voice as a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=22" target="_blank">00:00:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">topic is very broad and there are various ways of implementing it. One of those is through agents</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=29" target="_blank">00:00:29.980</a></span> | <span class="t">SDK. Agents SDK provides various voice features that just helps us build a voice agent quite easily</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=38" target="_blank">00:00:38.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and in my opinion would act probably more as a introduction to voice agents before you potentially</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=45" target="_blank">00:00:45.960</a></span> | <span class="t">step into something more advanced such as like it or daily. That being said you can do a lot already</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=53" target="_blank">00:00:53.560</a></span> | <span class="t">with just voice in agents SDK so I definitely recommend starting with this. Now to get started</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=59" target="_blank">00:00:59.160</a></span> | <span class="t">we're going to be using one of the chapters from an upcoming course that we're putting together</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=64" target="_blank">00:01:04.100</a></span> | <span class="t">which is focused on agents SDK. One of these chapters is on voice and this is sort of a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=71" target="_blank">00:01:11.820</a></span> | <span class="t">earlier mostly finished draft. So the way that we would use this is either you can install everything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=80" target="_blank">00:01:20.420</a></span> | <span class="t">through a pip install like so or the way that I would recommend doing this is actually to go ahead and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=87" target="_blank">00:01:27.240</a></span> | <span class="t">git clone. So I'll git clone that repo navigate into that repo and what you'll first want to do is make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=96" target="_blank">00:01:36.020</a></span> | <span class="t">sure you have uv installed. Then you want to run uv vns and you set a Python version to use. It doesn't have to be 3.12.7 but that's what I would recommend just to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=109" target="_blank">00:01:49.360</a></span> | <span class="t">essentially align your environment with the one I am using here. Then I would activate that environment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.980</a></span> | <span class="t">and you see now that I'm on Python 12.7 and agents SDK course which is the environment name</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=123" target="_blank">00:02:03.740</a></span> | <span class="t">and I would do uv sync to just ensure that you have all of the prerequisites or the latest prerequisites</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.020</a></span> | <span class="t">installed. Now once you've done that you can navigate to your code editor whatever you are using and open the repo</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and go to voice. Now I'm just going to take you through everything we need to know to get started with voice</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.700</a></span> | <span class="t">in Python. So the very first thing is actually not specific to agents SDK. We first need to understand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.760</a></span> | <span class="t">okay how do we handle voice or how do we handle audio in Python? How do we record audio? How do we play it back?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So first you're going to jump into that. Now in our notebook you're going to make sure I have the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.620</a></span> | <span class="t">correct kernel installed. It should be it should already preload here although you may have to go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.820</a></span> | <span class="t">into select a kernel and then find the vnbin Python. And then what we're going to do is take a look at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">sound device library. So this is the library that we are using to handle the more handle audio in Python.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So what we will need to do before recording or playing audio is get the sample rate of our input</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.780</a></span> | <span class="t">and output devices. And we do that with sound device query devices and then we want to look for input</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.140</a></span> | <span class="t">devices and output devices. Now if we run this we should see something like this especially if you're on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Macbook so I can see that I have my microphone and I can see that I have my speakers. Okay and then the sample rate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.880</a></span> | <span class="t">we're going to see is down here. So we're going to pull that in. So yep that's all I'm doing here. Pulling in that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">in sample rate and out sample rate. And then what we're going to do here is we're actually creating this input stream.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.740</a></span> | <span class="t">is what we're streaming our audio input into this object. And that is going to continue until we press</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.300</a></span> | <span class="t">enter because we've added this input function here. So let's go ahead and try that. Okay so you can see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.160</a></span> | <span class="t">at the top here it says press enter to confirm your input or escape to cancel. So actually right now as I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.780</a></span> | <span class="t">talking this is recording this is recording. So I'm going to press enter and I can come down here and see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.780</a></span> | <span class="t">that we have these recorded chunks. So what this is doing is it's recording these chunks of audio each of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">those is a numpy rate and each one of those chunks is 512 values that represent a very small amount of time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.800</a></span> | <span class="t">in our audio. So what we find is that we so right now we have 1401 of these chunks and then inside each</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">one of those is a 512 element vector. Okay also the one that you see here is the number of audio channels</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that we have. My microphone is recording in mono not stereo. So because it's mono there is just one audio</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.060</a></span> | <span class="t">channel. If it was stereo there would be two audio channels so this would be two dimensions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So what we need to do is actually concatenate all of these and it will create a single like audio array</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.340</a></span> | <span class="t">here and we can actually play that back. So let me just open the audio</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=322" target="_blank">00:05:22.300</a></span> | <span class="t">and we can just play this back and see see what is in there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay so you see at the top here it says press enter to confirm your input or escape to cancel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=333" target="_blank">00:05:33.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay so actually right now as I'm talking this is recording. So I'm going to press enter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay so that was the recording from before. Now that you can see that here this ran straight away.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=353" target="_blank">00:05:53.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So this cell it didn't wait for the audio to play. So what we can actually do here is we would write</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.180</a></span> | <span class="t">SD wait. And this will essentially the cell will complete once the audio completes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Now let's just come down and see what this audio looks like. So it's actually just going to be a waveform</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=374" target="_blank">00:06:14.860</a></span> | <span class="t">and we can see here. Okay so a pretty typical audio waveform there. So we have that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Now this is our audio file and what we need to do now is just transform it into this audio input type</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.940</a></span> | <span class="t">which is specific to Adrian's SDK. So this is the SDK's own like audio object where we'll be storing that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=399" target="_blank">00:06:39.500</a></span> | <span class="t">audio file. Okay you can see it's just it's just an array. I don't think there's anything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=404" target="_blank">00:06:44.300</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think there's anything beyond it beyond what we already did with you know having a numpy array.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=411" target="_blank">00:06:51.580</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's just a a type that I've now used to handle that array. So we have that. Now we're moving on to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=418" target="_blank">00:06:58.300</a></span> | <span class="t">all the voice pipeline stuff. So all the agent SDK stuff. Now obviously we will need an OpenAI API key</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=426" target="_blank">00:07:06.700</a></span> | <span class="t">at this point. So I'm going to run this and you'll need to get your OpenAI API key from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=432" target="_blank">00:07:12.860</a></span> | <span class="t">platform.openai.com. And once you have your API key you're just going to paste it into the top here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=440" target="_blank">00:07:20.300</a></span> | <span class="t">or wherever the little dialog box pops up for you and press center. Okay now we have our API key in there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=448" target="_blank">00:07:28.140</a></span> | <span class="t">and now what we're going to do is initialize an agent through Agents SDK. So there's nothing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMkbcSiS47o&t=455" target="_blank">00:07:35.340</a></span> | <span class="t">nothing unique or new here. Okay all we are doing is initializing normal agent.
