So today we want to go over the state of the mutual fund and ETF marketplace.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Look at the new funds that are opening, funds that are closing. We'll get into the active</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.480</a></span> | <span class="t">versus passive debate again. I mean, is this helping? And we'll talk about some portfolio</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.500</a></span> | <span class="t">management items at the end. Why don't we start out with the state of the mutual fund and ETF industry?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Sure. I think it's a picture of a vibrant industry, but there's a dichotomy for sure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.020</a></span> | <span class="t">When you look at what's growing and what's contracting. So let's start with what's growing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Indexing writ large is growing. ETFs is a category within indexing is growing. And then even within</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.860</a></span> | <span class="t">ETFs, you're seeing active investing growing, which is probably something maybe we'll touch upon a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.120</a></span> | <span class="t">bit later in the conversation because that's a burgeoning area. And then what's on the flip side?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.240</a></span> | <span class="t">It's basically the opposite of each one of those things. You're seeing active in many areas</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.420</a></span> | <span class="t">contract. You're seeing open-end funds as a category shrink further. And the convergence of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.680</a></span> | <span class="t">those two things, active mutual funds have really been under siege in recent years. So it's an industry</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">that continues to grow. And in fact, just by virtue of the market, even active open-end mutual funds</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">have seen growth, despite the fact that some of them have seen prodigious outflows over time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.520</a></span> | <span class="t">But you're seeing some real puts and takes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's get into the numbers here. How many mutual funds have been created versus how many ETFs have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">been created, say, over the past three years since I had you won last?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So in terms of mutual funds that have been created over the last three years,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.500</a></span> | <span class="t">around 1,300 have been created.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Does that include money market funds, too?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.060</a></span> | <span class="t">No. I'm sorry. I should have mentioned that. So that's just sort of your traditional sort of stock</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">bond allocation funds. No money markets included in that. And then if you're to focus on ETFs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.420</a></span> | <span class="t">there were around 1,700 ETFs that were created over the last three years. So you've seen more creation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.460</a></span> | <span class="t">within the ETF industry than you have in the fund industry. And so probably something you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.740</a></span> | <span class="t">wondering about, what about the converse, you know, the number of funds that have been mothballed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is pretty striking. So with respect to open-end mutual funds, around 4,400 have been merged or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.620</a></span> | <span class="t">liquidated away in the last three years compared to 642 ETFs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Wow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it's a picture of an ETF industry that continues to expand, not only by assets, but in terms of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.900</a></span> | <span class="t">net number of vehicles. And then with respect to open-end funds, you're actually seeing the industry</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.540</a></span> | <span class="t">contract. There were a number of years, as you well know, where the industry was growing like wildfire,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=333" target="_blank">00:05:33.620</a></span> | <span class="t">both in terms of assets, as well as in terms of number of funds. But it's actually been shrinking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.180</a></span> | <span class="t">in recent years. And you could argue that that's an industry that's adapting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.340</a></span> | <span class="t">to a more sobering set of conditions than it faced in the past.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=348" target="_blank">00:05:48.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So I just want to make sure I heard this correctly. Open-end funds, traditional open-end funds,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=353" target="_blank">00:05:53.780</a></span> | <span class="t">whether it's indexed funds or actively managed funds. 1,300 approximately have been created</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.020</a></span> | <span class="t">in the last three years and 4,400 have closed?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.460</a></span> | <span class="t">That's correct.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Wow. That is a huge number. Did it include different share classes like A-share, B-share,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=373" target="_blank">00:06:13.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Z-share, I-share? Are those part of the 4,400?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Indeed, it did. So this is all share classes. And so you're right that some of this can be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.780</a></span> | <span class="t">share class consolidation, of which there has been some. At the margins, there can also be a little bit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=387" target="_blank">00:06:27.620</a></span> | <span class="t">of open-end ETF conversion activity that you might have seen take place in the last three years that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=393" target="_blank">00:06:33.300</a></span> | <span class="t">picked up a little bit. That's more of a rounding error in that number. It's more about the economics of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=399" target="_blank">00:06:39.060</a></span> | <span class="t">running money in the open-end format. A lot of these, they're smaller in size, or they just want to tidy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=404" target="_blank">00:06:44.740</a></span> | <span class="t">up their lineup, close some share classes so that they can gain a little bit of scale across a fund's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.660</a></span> | <span class="t">various share classes. But yeah, the open-end fund industry is in contraction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=415" target="_blank">00:06:55.780</a></span> | <span class="t">You did mention something I want to bring up here, and that is converting from a traditional</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=421" target="_blank">00:07:01.300</a></span> | <span class="t">open-end fund to an ETF. How many funds have done that? And is that a growing trend?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=428" target="_blank">00:07:08.980</a></span> | <span class="t">It is a growing trend.

So what it's tended to mean is that fund companies have been more picky about what they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=490" target="_blank">00:08:10.580</a></span> | <span class="t">convert. But we have seen some large fund families that have converted, probably most notably Dimensional,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=496" target="_blank">00:08:16.820</a></span> | <span class="t">has converted a number of their mutual funds, and that's real money. There's been significant,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=502" target="_blank">00:08:22.100</a></span> | <span class="t">we're talking billions of dollars in assets that have converted. JP Morgan is another name that springs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=507" target="_blank">00:08:27.780</a></span> | <span class="t">to mind. But then we've also seen some traditional, very large open-end active players who've opted to go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=514" target="_blank">00:08:34.580</a></span> | <span class="t">a different route, just launching DeNovo, like good examples of that. Probably the most prominent would be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=519" target="_blank">00:08:39.940</a></span> | <span class="t">capital group, capital group, also known as American funds. They brought out a number of active ETFs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=526" target="_blank">00:08:46.420</a></span> | <span class="t">and those are not conversions. A few years ago, Vanguard held this patent on being able to launch</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=534" target="_blank">00:08:54.020</a></span> | <span class="t">an ETF share class against their traditional open-end funds. That's how VTI, the total stock market ETF,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=542" target="_blank">00:09:02.900</a></span> | <span class="t">and VTSAX, which is the total stock market fund, are the same fund, just different share classes. And for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=550" target="_blank">00:09:10.500</a></span> | <span class="t">many years, almost 20 years, Vanguard owned a patent on this, and no one else could do it. That came off</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=557" target="_blank">00:09:17.540</a></span> | <span class="t">patent, I want to say, a couple of years ago. And I've seen a lot of companies doing that. Is that something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=565" target="_blank">00:09:25.460</a></span> | <span class="t">that's a trend? Not yet. Because I believe that we've got a number of fund companies that have applied</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=571" target="_blank">00:09:31.140</a></span> | <span class="t">to the SEC to do this. My colleague Ben Johnson has done a really good job of chronicling this. I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=576" target="_blank">00:09:36.980</a></span> | <span class="t">there's dozens of fund companies at this point. But what we have typically seen the traditional active</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=583" target="_blank">00:09:43.940</a></span> | <span class="t">providers do is either convert, like we had talked about before, or they will just bring out sort of a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=590" target="_blank">00:09:50.820</a></span> | <span class="t">version of an active strategy that they offer, but it will not be a just sort of a new share class that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=597" target="_blank">00:09:57.860</a></span> | <span class="t">sprouts from the existing fund, if that makes sense. So if you've got like a fund that's got like four or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=602" target="_blank">00:10:02.580</a></span> | <span class="t">five share classes to it, we're not yet seeing them at that fifth or sixth share class, the fifth or sixth</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=608" target="_blank">00:10:08.020</a></span> | <span class="t">being an ETF. It's a new offering essentially that resembles maybe the traditional open-end fund</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=615" target="_blank">00:10:15.380</a></span> | <span class="t">that they offer, but isn't an exact replica like you would have if they just sort of sprouted a new</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=620" target="_blank">00:10:20.340</a></span> | <span class="t">share class. And is that because it's still in SEC registration, and the SEC is working on it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=626" target="_blank">00:10:26.020</a></span> | <span class="t">and that's the reason why this hasn't happened? That's right. But I know that it's awaiting regulatory</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=630" target="_blank">00:10:30.740</a></span> | <span class="t">approval. I think that there's also an operational dimension to this for some fund companies. But as Ben</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=636" target="_blank">00:10:36.740</a></span> | <span class="t">has done a really good job of chronicling, that hasn't stopped many of them from going and applying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=641" target="_blank">00:10:41.540</a></span> | <span class="t">for this, notwithstanding whatever sort of operational hurdles might stand in their way,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=644" target="_blank">00:10:44.980</a></span> | <span class="t">clearly they feel like they can surmount those challenges. Let's look at some of these new offerings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=650" target="_blank">00:10:50.740</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm a casual observer of some of these new ETFs that are coming out, and there are a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=662" target="_blank">00:11:02.100</a></span> | <span class="t">interesting ones. Very niche, very specific, even single-stock ETFs leveraged. So let's go ahead and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=672" target="_blank">00:11:12.820</a></span> | <span class="t">start at the top of the three categories that I found. The first one is thematic funds. It seemed to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=680" target="_blank">00:11:20.820</a></span> | <span class="t">very popular. Yep. So thematic funds, you're quite right. That has been a very popular category. I would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=687" target="_blank">00:11:27.620</a></span> | <span class="t">say it peaked a few years ago back, probably 2021. I think that we saw 57 thematic ETFs launch it since</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=695" target="_blank">00:11:35.380</a></span> | <span class="t">tapered off a bit. For instance, in the last year ended February 25, there were only 17 new thematic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=703" target="_blank">00:11:43.380</a></span> | <span class="t">ETFs that were launched. So it's definitely cooled down. And I think that's attributable to a couple of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=709" target="_blank">00:11:49.460</a></span> | <span class="t">things. I mean, one is, I think the industry maybe got shook out a little bit. 2022, by the market downturn,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=715" target="_blank">00:11:55.620</a></span> | <span class="t">which hit some of these strategies really hard, and even some of them hit a harder times even before</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=720" target="_blank">00:12:00.900</a></span> | <span class="t">that. I think the other factor is investors have had some difficulties using these successfully. I did</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=727" target="_blank">00:12:07.220</a></span> | <span class="t">a little bit of work on this a month or so ago, looking at how the average dollar invested in thematic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=732" target="_blank">00:12:12.980</a></span> | <span class="t">strategies had done over a period of time. I think I looked at the trailing three years, maybe as of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=739" target="_blank">00:12:19.060</a></span> | <span class="t">January. And what I found is that the average dollar had lost money, despite the fact that it was a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=744" target="_blank">00:12:24.900</a></span> | <span class="t">pretty hospitable market climate. What's more, you found that the average dollar in thematics,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=751" target="_blank">00:12:31.220</a></span> | <span class="t">not only did it lose money, but it badly lagged how the average dollar had done in just a plain old</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=758" target="_blank">00:12:38.340</a></span> | <span class="t">target date 2050 fund. You know, I picked a 2050 because it's a lot of 25, 30 year time horizon,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=764" target="_blank">00:12:44.740</a></span> | <span class="t">which mimics what you'd see with a thematic. And those made good money. It was like 67%. So it was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=770" target="_blank">00:12:50.340</a></span> | <span class="t">basically a 14% per annum difference in the return to the average dollar of a thematic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=774" target="_blank">00:12:54.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And I, so I think the fact that, you know, you've had these very divergent sort of experiences,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=779" target="_blank">00:12:59.860</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of rates of success in thematics, that probably also has induced some of the slowdown</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=785" target="_blank">00:13:05.540</a></span> | <span class="t">that we've seen in those, but they're a big category. They have at last count around $113 billion</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=792" target="_blank">00:13:12.340</a></span> | <span class="t">in net assets in thematic ETFs. And so the fact that there's a good amount of money there,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=798" target="_blank">00:13:18.660</a></span> | <span class="t">there's been some legs of growth to it. It'll continue to attract some activity, which we've seen,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=802" target="_blank">00:13:22.980</a></span> | <span class="t">like I said, 17 of these launched in the last year. A lot of times these thematic funds, which might be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=808" target="_blank">00:13:28.260</a></span> | <span class="t">artificial intelligence or that, whatever the theme is, the investment theme is of the fund,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=814" target="_blank">00:13:34.500</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a lag.

I've been, I've been around the industry</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=819" target="_blank">00:13:39.540</a></span> | <span class="t">for almost 40 years now, and it's constant, right? If something is hot, then a fund eventually gets</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=828" target="_blank">00:13:48.260</a></span> | <span class="t">created, but it does take time to get the offering through the SEC.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=833" target="_blank">00:13:53.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Exactly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=834" target="_blank">00:13:54.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So by the time the fund launches, the shooting star is beginning to burn out in a way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=841" target="_blank">00:14:01.700</a></span> | <span class="t">That's right.

There were,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1008" target="_blank">00:16:48.500</a></span> | <span class="t">last year, dozens of leveraged ETFs come out.

Because one of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1018" target="_blank">00:16:58.980</a></span> | <span class="t">emerging trends that we've seen in that space is single stock leveraged ETFs. So think of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1025" target="_blank">00:17:05.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Nvidia, think of MicroStrategy. I mean, typically, these are kind of growth names. They've got some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1034" target="_blank">00:17:14.020</a></span> | <span class="t">curb appeal to them. And they attract the trading crowd. And that's really what these ETFs are designed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1041" target="_blank">00:17:21.860</a></span> | <span class="t">to appeal to. And so, but the new wave in these have been single stock leveraged ETFs. You know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1048" target="_blank">00:17:28.500</a></span> | <span class="t">this is something else I wrote a little bit about. There was a piece that went up a bit,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1052" target="_blank">00:17:32.900</a></span> | <span class="t">just, you know, focusing on, this was as of early February, the sorts of results</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1056" target="_blank">00:17:36.420</a></span> | <span class="t">that it looked like investors had seen in products like these, again, focused on the average dollar,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1063" target="_blank">00:17:43.140</a></span> | <span class="t">which is sort of an internal rate of return calculation, dollar weighted return calculation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1067" target="_blank">00:17:47.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And what you found is if you actually took the reference assets, whether it's a single stock,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1074" target="_blank">00:17:54.020</a></span> | <span class="t">like it could be an ETF, more commonly, it's an index, and you just basically ran their return</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1080" target="_blank">00:18:00.580</a></span> | <span class="t">without the leverage, you only earned about five percentage points more in these products than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1088" target="_blank">00:18:08.660</a></span> | <span class="t">would have the underlying assets without any of the leverage and certainly with far</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1093" target="_blank">00:18:13.140</a></span> | <span class="t">less volatility.

But I think it does underscore the fact</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1103" target="_blank">00:18:23.460</a></span> | <span class="t">that there's real issues with these.

So they're fulfilling their obligation. But you know, it does seem that that probably there are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1121" target="_blank">00:18:41.780</a></span> | <span class="t">there are investors who stick in these for longer than that. And they probably are doing so to their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1126" target="_blank">00:18:46.260</a></span> | <span class="t">detriment because there's more volatility. There's certainly more fee.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1129" target="_blank">00:18:49.060</a></span> | <span class="t">I do see that when a new person comes to me and I look and see what they own. Occasionally, I'll see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1135" target="_blank">00:18:55.860</a></span> | <span class="t">a 2x or 3x. And they've held it for quite a while. And their rate of return isn't 2x or 3x because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1147" target="_blank">00:19:07.700</a></span> | <span class="t">there's also 2x and 3x volatility. And when you compound volatility, you erode away whatever excess</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1156" target="_blank">00:19:16.020</a></span> | <span class="t">return there is. That's right. The SEC has put out multiple advisories to investors on these funds,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1164" target="_blank">00:19:24.500</a></span> | <span class="t">and even put out warnings to broker-dealers, because I remember in the past some broker-dealers got in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1170" target="_blank">00:19:30.820</a></span> | <span class="t">trouble for not telling the clients how risky these things are.

You could leverage something within a fund without actually having to have a margin</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1188" target="_blank">00:19:48.820</a></span> | <span class="t">account. It's not something Bogleheads probably would be investing in, although I have seen a few of them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1194" target="_blank">00:19:54.580</a></span> | <span class="t">in accounts. The last category I want to discuss is private equity inside an ETF. And the big one is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1203" target="_blank">00:20:03.940</a></span> | <span class="t">SpaceX, right? Now you can own SpaceX if you buy this ETF, even though SpaceX doesn't trade. You wrote some on this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1210" target="_blank">00:20:10.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is maybe one of the hottest themes going, the public-private convergence. For the record,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1218" target="_blank">00:20:18.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't have an issue with the notion of investor investing in both public and private, as long as they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1223" target="_blank">00:20:23.620</a></span> | <span class="t">understand the associated trade-offs. What's been new is ETFs and open-end funds entering this space. The</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1231" target="_blank">00:20:31.060</a></span> | <span class="t">reason why it has not been common to this point, as we know, these are daily liquidity vehicles. They</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1236" target="_blank">00:20:36.020</a></span> | <span class="t">need to be able to fulfill buy and sell orders. And so what that means is that the underlying securities</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1241" target="_blank">00:20:41.300</a></span> | <span class="t">they invest in need to be sufficiently liquid and have readily ascertainable market values. And that doesn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1246" target="_blank">00:20:46.900</a></span> | <span class="t">really describe private equity or private credit for that matter. And my colleagues, especially Jack</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1251" target="_blank">00:20:51.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Shannon, have done lots of work on open-end funds that have owned stakes in private equity. Some of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1257" target="_blank">00:20:57.380</a></span> | <span class="t">big complexes, Fidelity, T-Row, and the like, they do have positions in private equity in their open-end funds,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1263" target="_blank">00:21:03.620</a></span> | <span class="t">but they have tended to be at the margins. And Jack has done a really good job of covering that for us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1268" target="_blank">00:21:08.820</a></span> | <span class="t">over time, as did Katie Reichert before him. I focused on a newer ETF. It's called ER shares, private public</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1276" target="_blank">00:21:16.740</a></span> | <span class="t">crossover ETF. The ticker is XOVR. And what's notable about what it's doing is it is committed to investing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1284" target="_blank">00:21:24.660</a></span> | <span class="t">more meaningfully in private equity up to the 15% limit on a liquids. And to do so, it took a sizable stake in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1293" target="_blank">00:21:33.620</a></span> | <span class="t">SpaceX. It's around 11% of its net assets. And that's a pretty chunky position in an illiquid for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1302" target="_blank">00:21:42.900</a></span> | <span class="t">an ETF to have. And so what I try to do with the piece is just kind of go through the progression to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1308" target="_blank">00:21:48.660</a></span> | <span class="t">ask the questions that I would think somebody that's diligently a product like that would ask themselves,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1314" target="_blank">00:21:54.180</a></span> | <span class="t">which I think it's probably advisable for us to all ask as this sort of trend plays its way through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1321" target="_blank">00:22:01.380</a></span> | <span class="t">open-end funds in ETFs. It's questions like, how do they access and transact in the private equity</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1327" target="_blank">00:22:07.300</a></span> | <span class="t">securities concerned? How do they value it? How do they manage the associated liquidity risk?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1333" target="_blank">00:22:13.940</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, when you're kicking the tires on vehicles like those, there should be sort of satisfactory</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1338" target="_blank">00:22:18.980</a></span> | <span class="t">answers that are forthcoming on each of those questions. But I was having a hard time with that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1342" target="_blank">00:22:22.580</a></span> | <span class="t">particular ETF and kind of getting at the answers to those things. So that's why I wrote the piece.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1347" target="_blank">00:22:27.780</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's a hot area. There's, as you know, there's a new SSGA ETF. It's a partnership with Apollo</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1355" target="_blank">00:22:35.860</a></span> | <span class="t">that will invest meaningfully in private credit. That's just getting off the ground. It was recently</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1362" target="_blank">00:22:42.740</a></span> | <span class="t">approved. And so all eyes are on that to see sort of how this experiment will play out in practice. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1368" target="_blank">00:22:48.260</a></span> | <span class="t">that has been a much talked about area. I recall back in the 1990s, a fund manager by the name of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1377" target="_blank">00:22:57.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Garrett Von Wagner, who was very successful growth stock manager and started to left the company he was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1387" target="_blank">00:23:07.300</a></span> | <span class="t">with, started his own group of growth stock mutual funds. And he did this. He put private equity in a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1398" target="_blank">00:23:18.180</a></span> | <span class="t">mutual fund. The problem was, there's no valuation model where you could say this is what the daily</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1407" target="_blank">00:23:27.620</a></span> | <span class="t">value of the value of private equity was because it's private equity. So he didn't trade. And the SEC</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1415" target="_blank">00:23:35.540</a></span> | <span class="t">called him out on it. And without admitting anything, he paid the SEC something like a $600,000 fine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1423" target="_blank">00:23:43.860</a></span> | <span class="t">because it was the contention of the SEC that he was mispricing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1429" target="_blank">00:23:49.860</a></span> | <span class="t">these private equities in the fund. And it was an open-to-end fund. So that was a problem because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1435" target="_blank">00:23:55.300</a></span> | <span class="t">that means the people who were buying the fund would be paying too much. And the people who were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1439" target="_blank">00:23:59.940</a></span> | <span class="t">selling the shares would be getting too much. So it wasn't a fair market. Do you recall that by any</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=1444" target="_blank">00:24:04.980</a></span> | <span class="t">chance?

So with respect to ETFs, they saw $1.2 trillion in net inflows. And so I think for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2027" target="_blank">00:33:47.060</a></span> | <span class="t">the year 2024 was the biggest ever for ETFs, 1.1 trillion of net inflows. And so that's equivalent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2034" target="_blank">00:33:54.900</a></span> | <span class="t">to a 14% organic growth rate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2037" target="_blank">00:33:57.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, this is inflows.

So it was around half a trillion dollars in outflows, give or take over the course of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2072" target="_blank">00:34:32.100</a></span> | <span class="t">last year for open end funds.

And this is just the past year that trend</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2078" target="_blank">00:34:38.020</a></span> | <span class="t">has been playing itself out. The ETF industry at this point, for those who are wondering, it's a nearly $11 trillion</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2085" target="_blank">00:34:45.540</a></span> | <span class="t">industry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2087" target="_blank">00:34:47.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Open end funds, believe it or not, despite the fact that we've seen this torrent of flows out of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2093" target="_blank">00:34:53.640</a></span> | <span class="t">open end funds into ETFs, it's still a $21 trillion industry. So when you look at the market share of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2101" target="_blank">00:35:01.080</a></span> | <span class="t">open end funds versus ETFs, it's still about two to one open end fund assets to ETF assets.

So just to give you an example</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2344" target="_blank">00:39:04.760</a></span> | <span class="t">for the U.S. large cap categories, only about 6% of active U.S. large blend funds beat their passive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2353" target="_blank">00:39:13.560</a></span> | <span class="t">composite composite over the 10-year period and to December 2024.

As you range</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2367" target="_blank">00:39:27.240</a></span> | <span class="t">out to some of the other areas, you would have seen the success rates perk up a bit.

I mean, over a one year period, it might be some years 60%</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2435" target="_blank">00:40:35.880</a></span> | <span class="t">of active outperformed, some years 40, some years less. But as you move out to five years, the number</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2442" target="_blank">00:40:42.200</a></span> | <span class="t">drops. You also have a survivorship bias. I mean, a lot of funds just close, and so they're not included</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2447" target="_blank">00:40:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">in the data anymore. And the only data you can include is the funds that's still around, and maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2451" target="_blank">00:40:51.560</a></span> | <span class="t">the funds that were around before they closed, you can include that data. But once you go out to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2457" target="_blank">00:40:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">10 years, the percentages drop even more. 15 years, they tend to drop more. And by 20 years, you're really,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2463" target="_blank">00:41:03.400</a></span> | <span class="t">really dropping. And I found this to be true, regardless of the period of time you're looking at. It could be the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2470" target="_blank">00:41:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">last 20 years. You could start in 2000, looking backwards 20 years. You could start in 1980, look backwards 20 years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2475" target="_blank">00:41:15.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And these numbers are very consistent. The longer you hold your active funds, the lower the probability they will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2483" target="_blank">00:41:23.960</a></span> | <span class="t">outperform the index. And you talk about that phenomenon, that recurring phenomenon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2489" target="_blank">00:41:29.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh yeah, for sure. No, I think that point's really well taken. I would say the common denominator across</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2495" target="_blank">00:41:35.720</a></span> | <span class="t">all these different time periods that we might have measured, you know, going back in time, funds come</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2501" target="_blank">00:41:41.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and they go. My colleague found that, you know, over a typical 10-year time horizon,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2507" target="_blank">00:41:47.480</a></span> | <span class="t">30 to 40, in some cases, even 50% of the active funds that began the period did not survive to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2514" target="_blank">00:41:54.360</a></span> | <span class="t">end of the period. And so, the common thread here is sort of the perishability of some of these active</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2520" target="_blank">00:42:00.280</a></span> | <span class="t">funds. That plays a large part in explaining why success rates aren't higher than they are. I'm not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2526" target="_blank">00:42:06.040</a></span> | <span class="t">suggesting that they would necessarily be markedly better, even if all of these active funds that die in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2533" target="_blank">00:42:13.320</a></span> | <span class="t">droves were to somehow survive to the end. There's a number of other factors that probably portend</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2539" target="_blank">00:42:19.480</a></span> | <span class="t">against that. But nevertheless, one of the overarching factors in why active funds have struggled to beat</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2546" target="_blank">00:42:26.680</a></span> | <span class="t">their passive composites in greater numbers is the fact that they just don't make it to the end. They</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2551" target="_blank">00:42:31.160</a></span> | <span class="t">don't have the staying power. The other thing I wanted to bring up about the data is that you mentioned in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2558" target="_blank">00:42:38.520</a></span> | <span class="t">last 10 years bond funds, if you bought an actively managed bond fund, it's maybe a coin flip. You've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2565" target="_blank">00:42:45.400</a></span> | <span class="t">got a 50-50 chance of outperforming the bond index. However, I do want to point this out about the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2571" target="_blank">00:42:51.960</a></span> | <span class="t">difference between bond funds and stock funds, is that when you look at the range of returns of the stock</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2582" target="_blank">00:43:02.600</a></span> | <span class="t">stock funds over that 10-year period, it's an 80 percentile of the funds fall into a very wide range,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2590" target="_blank">00:43:10.040</a></span> | <span class="t">like 5% between the ones that do come close to beating the market or even maybe beat it by a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2596" target="_blank">00:43:16.600</a></span> | <span class="t">bit, and the ones on the other side of the chart that underperform that 80 percentile. It's a wide range,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2605" target="_blank">00:43:25.720</a></span> | <span class="t">like 5% difference. But that's not the case with bond funds. Bond funds is a very narrow, peaky</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2614" target="_blank">00:43:34.200</a></span> | <span class="t">graph, where the ones that outperform might outperform by a half a percent. The ones that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2621" target="_blank">00:43:41.400</a></span> | <span class="t">underperform, underperform by maybe a half a percent. And if you just bought the index,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2627" target="_blank">00:43:47.320</a></span> | <span class="t">which is in the middle, you did just fine. So if you're going to try to beat the market,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2633" target="_blank">00:43:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and you want to beat it meaningfully, and you're trying to do it in a balanced portfolio,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2639" target="_blank">00:43:59.320</a></span> | <span class="t">it becomes very difficult because the equity side of that has a very low probability of outperforming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2644" target="_blank">00:44:04.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And you could underperform by an awful lot. So if you have a three-fund portfolio of U.S. stock,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2650" target="_blank">00:44:10.280</a></span> | <span class="t">international stock, and bonds, you could pick three actively managed funds. The bonds might actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2655" target="_blank">00:44:15.080</a></span> | <span class="t">do okay. They might outperform by a half. But if one of your stock funds underperforms by three percent,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2660" target="_blank">00:44:20.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, you just blew the whole thing out of the water, and you should have just had three index</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2664" target="_blank">00:44:24.280</a></span> | <span class="t">funds. No, I think that's exactly right. If we look at this on two different axes, one being likelihood</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2669" target="_blank">00:44:29.560</a></span> | <span class="t">of success, the other being expected payoff, I suppose. Like you say, what you would find is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2676" target="_blank">00:44:36.280</a></span> | <span class="t">you probably have a lower likelihood of success in equity, albeit with maybe a larger potential payoff,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2682" target="_blank">00:44:42.840</a></span> | <span class="t">should it survive to the end and actually beat the passive composite, should it do so. Whereas</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2687" target="_blank">00:44:47.960</a></span> | <span class="t">with fixed income funds, there might be a slightly higher chance to succeed to beat the passive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2693" target="_blank">00:44:53.320</a></span> | <span class="t">composite. But as you say, it's not going to do a moonshot. You're not going to get this huge payoff</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2698" target="_blank">00:44:58.760</a></span> | <span class="t">where it's beating the benchmark by multiple percentage points. If it's doing so, you actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2704" target="_blank">00:45:04.120</a></span> | <span class="t">probably want to diligence further just to make sure you understand your strategy and why there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2708" target="_blank">00:45:08.280</a></span> | <span class="t">that sort of tracking error to it, because it can obviously go the opposite way. So you should be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2712" target="_blank">00:45:12.680</a></span> | <span class="t">thinking of it along both of those dimensions, as you rightly point out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2715" target="_blank">00:45:15.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I wrote about this in a book called The Power of Passive Investing, and I said the same thing. It's like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2720" target="_blank">00:45:20.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you might be able to pick one fund out of three that outperforms, but unless that outperforms by a lot,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2725" target="_blank">00:45:25.240</a></span> | <span class="t">your portfolio still underperforms. So just do all index funds, and you have a high probability of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2731" target="_blank">00:45:31.640</a></span> | <span class="t">outperforming a portfolio of active funds. I do want to get to a couple more items. And you did a lot of work on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2739" target="_blank">00:45:39.800</a></span> | <span class="t">active funds again, but here looking beyond the fee. Clearly, everyone agrees that active funds have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2747" target="_blank">00:45:47.160</a></span> | <span class="t">higher fees, and you have to get over that hurdle rate first. But your research even went in a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2753" target="_blank">00:45:53.960</a></span> | <span class="t">bit deeper, at least recently, that says, well, you know, if you buy the past performing funds that have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2760" target="_blank">00:46:00.440</a></span> | <span class="t">low fees, something might be there. Can you describe that? Yeah, so we took a look at what might be doing a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2768" target="_blank">00:46:08.200</a></span> | <span class="t">good job of sorting based on future performance, as it were. And so we looked at a couple things. One</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2772" target="_blank">00:46:12.120</a></span> | <span class="t">was past performance before fees. The other was fees themselves. And what we actually found is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2778" target="_blank">00:46:18.440</a></span> | <span class="t">if you favor the funds that had the best past performance before fees, and then furthermore,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2783" target="_blank">00:46:23.800</a></span> | <span class="t">within that cohort, you favor the lowest cost, you greatly boosted your odds of success of beating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2789" target="_blank">00:46:29.480</a></span> | <span class="t">your average peer over time. So I think for a lot of your listeners, they're already sort of well</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2795" target="_blank">00:46:35.720</a></span> | <span class="t">accustomed to sort of pinching pennies and favoring lower cost funds. I think that probably they would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2801" target="_blank">00:46:41.080</a></span> | <span class="t">be less inclined to factor past performance in. But what our research found is that actually past</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2806" target="_blank">00:46:46.200</a></span> | <span class="t">performance before fees has done a more than respectable job in recent years of sorting funds</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2811" target="_blank">00:46:51.480</a></span> | <span class="t">based on past performers. Those which outperform before fees, this was across asset classes and across</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2817" target="_blank">00:46:57.560</a></span> | <span class="t">years, were likely to outperform their average peer going forward than were the low performers in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2823" target="_blank">00:47:03.560</a></span> | <span class="t">past which tended to lag their average peer peer over future periods.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2828" target="_blank">00:47:08.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So the message is that if you are going to pick</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2830" target="_blank">00:47:10.280</a></span> | <span class="t">a active fund, let's say you're in a 401k plan and they don't have any index funds, which would be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2836" target="_blank">00:47:16.280</a></span> | <span class="t">very unusual, by the way, because most 401k plans at least have an S&P 500 now. But let's say you're in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2841" target="_blank">00:47:21.560</a></span> | <span class="t">a 401k or 403b, you know, legacy thing that's really not good investment options. Then you should opt for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2849" target="_blank">00:47:29.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the highest past performing active fund that has the lowest fee and that gives you the highest probability</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2857" target="_blank">00:47:37.720</a></span> | <span class="t">of at least getting maybe close to the market return, if not maybe outperforming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2862" target="_blank">00:47:42.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I would start with fees. I think that's your best starting place. And my colleague Russ Kinnell did</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2867" target="_blank">00:47:47.720</a></span> | <span class="t">landmark research some years ago on which variables do the best job of predicting future fund net return</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2874" target="_blank">00:47:54.280</a></span> | <span class="t">performance and fees shine through. And so if anything, I think the research that I did more recently</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2880" target="_blank">00:48:00.680</a></span> | <span class="t">builds very slightly on the work that Russ had done previously. But fees not only tilt the odds in your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2887" target="_blank">00:48:07.880</a></span> | <span class="t">favor if you're looking at it versus other funds that are relevant peers, but also some of the more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2893" target="_blank">00:48:13.640</a></span> | <span class="t">recent research I did, you know, I found that cheaper funds are likelier to survive over a longer time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2899" target="_blank">00:48:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">period than our pricier funds. So you also tilt the odds in your favor that way. Then secondarily,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2905" target="_blank">00:48:25.160</a></span> | <span class="t">you can look at performance, you know, we have tended to find in the last, you know, 10, 20 years,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2910" target="_blank">00:48:30.760</a></span> | <span class="t">that past performance before fees has done a pretty good job of sorting.

It's been a momentum market in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2926" target="_blank">00:48:46.440</a></span> | <span class="t">last few years where the magnificent seven, you had to have them. And it's been that way for several years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2935" target="_blank">00:48:55.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And active managers who did have them probably kept them at least a portion. In fact, you had an article</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2940" target="_blank">00:49:00.920</a></span> | <span class="t">on that talking about the portfolio construction of active funds, where they look a whole lot more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2946" target="_blank">00:49:06.600</a></span> | <span class="t">like closet index funds than what the active managers would say. But the bottom line is there's been a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2951" target="_blank">00:49:11.400</a></span> | <span class="t">lot of momentum in the market. Does some of that research about past performance have to do with recent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2956" target="_blank">00:49:16.600</a></span> | <span class="t">momentum?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2957" target="_blank">00:49:17.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I think that's very astute. So I, I owe sort of our readers a follow up article to sort of dig into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2963" target="_blank">00:49:23.080</a></span> | <span class="t">what some of the factors that explain it. But, but I think that you're keying on on some of the most</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2967" target="_blank">00:49:27.640</a></span> | <span class="t">important factors. We've seen an unusual persistence of large beating small of growth, beating value of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2976" target="_blank">00:49:36.680</a></span> | <span class="t">domestic, beating foreign, of spread within fixed in, beating govy. These are areas which, in some cases, you'll see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2986" target="_blank">00:49:46.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the best past performance having had favored, and they'll stick with that. And it's tended to reward them if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2993" target="_blank">00:49:53.880</a></span> | <span class="t">they've stuck with those things. So yeah, there has been a certain pro cyclicality to it. And I think that explains</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=2999" target="_blank">00:49:59.240</a></span> | <span class="t">some of the trended performance. But as we know, that can reverse itself quite dramatically in the markets. And so that's why I think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=3006" target="_blank">00:50:06.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I think probably people are best served to start with cost rather than past performance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=3010" target="_blank">00:50:10.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Last area I want to get into is portfolio management. And just a couple of items here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=3014" target="_blank">00:50:14.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Sure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=3015" target="_blank">00:50:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">A couple of reports that you did looking at the asset allocation of portfolios. And we tend to, I don't want to say we're trend</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=3025" target="_blank">00:50:25.740</a></span> | <span class="t">followers. We, we are, but the fact is we are trend followers, at least to the point where we don't like to rebalance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=3033" target="_blank">00:50:33.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And that when U.S. equities are doing well, we tend to let that become a greater and greater portion of our portfolio</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=3039" target="_blank">00:50:39.460</a></span> | <span class="t">than rebalancing, say, to international. Or if equities in general are doing better than bonds,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=3045" target="_blank">00:50:45.860</a></span> | <span class="t">or bonds are not doing well, so you really should be selling some stock and buying some more bonds,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=3050" target="_blank">00:50:50.580</a></span> | <span class="t">we tend to not do that. At least that's what I read from your data. Is that an accurate assessment?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=3056" target="_blank">00:50:56.740</a></span> | <span class="t">That is an accurate assessment. Inertia is very powerful. And on the flip side, it can be very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=3061" target="_blank">00:51:01.860</a></span> | <span class="t">uncomfortable. Indeed, when we go through a rebalance take from our strong performers and give to our weak</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=3067" target="_blank">00:51:07.380</a></span> | <span class="t">performers, there's a natural aversion to doing so. It's incidentally, it's one of the reasons why</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=3072" target="_blank">00:51:12.900</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that strategies which automate those tasks, like target date funds, like target risk funds,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=3079" target="_blank">00:51:19.780</a></span> | <span class="t">are so useful to investors. Certainly, there's probably an optimal solution out there, quote,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=3086" target="_blank">00:51:26.020</a></span> | <span class="t">unquote, that could maybe carve the asset allocation more precisely, or do the rebalancing and reconstitution</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=3093" target="_blank">00:51:33.700</a></span> | <span class="t">in a more tailor made way. But I don't think people should make perfect the enemy of good target date funds,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=3099" target="_blank">00:51:39.220</a></span> | <span class="t">target risk funds, are perfectly acceptable solutions. They help people to earn more of their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=3105" target="_blank">00:51:45.060</a></span> | <span class="t">funds, total returns to participate in markets, and to do so in a way that appropriately balances risk</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=3110" target="_blank">00:51:50.500</a></span> | <span class="t">and opportunity. And so I think that helps you to overcome inertia, and there's no real action that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=3117" target="_blank">00:51:57.700</a></span> | <span class="t">required on your part. But the research that we did recently, you know, in a sense, it tried to quantify</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=3122" target="_blank">00:52:02.500</a></span> | <span class="t">some of that inertia. And what we did was we just went through and we tallied up all the assets by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=3128" target="_blank">00:52:08.020</a></span> | <span class="t">type of fund, and literally the securities that they held. And what we found that there was some drift</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=3133" target="_blank">00:52:13.780</a></span> | <span class="t">into equities, US equities, large in particular, and away from some of the areas that haven't performed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=3139" target="_blank">00:52:19.300</a></span> | <span class="t">us strongly. So cash bonds, foreign stocks. And so, you know, when you kind of went through and sort of added</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=3146" target="_blank">00:52:26.020</a></span> | <span class="t">it up, it was around we found $800 billion in assets that probably ought to be rebalanced, assuming certain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=3154" target="_blank">00:52:34.660</a></span> | <span class="t">things about what kind of the baseline allocation should be. It's not huge in percentage terms. I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=3160" target="_blank">00:52:40.020</a></span> | <span class="t">we're talking about 3% of the equity allocation would need to be moved back into cash and bonds,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=3166" target="_blank">00:52:46.340</a></span> | <span class="t">let's say, and then within the equity sleeve a little bit of rejiggering around of the domestic to foreign</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=3171" target="_blank">00:52:51.860</a></span> | <span class="t">split. You know, but it's real money in dollar terms. And we've seen in periods like the one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=3177" target="_blank">00:52:57.060</a></span> | <span class="t">we're coming off of that we can all get a little complacent as investors in doing some rebalancing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=3182" target="_blank">00:53:02.340</a></span> | <span class="t">and adjusting given our objectives and circumstances can be very much worthwhile. And this was our attempt</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=3187" target="_blank">00:53:07.380</a></span> | <span class="t">to quantify that. One last question. We're talking about the creation of ETFs and target date funds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=3194" target="_blank">00:53:14.260</a></span> | <span class="t">I still am yet to see any kind of a push by the fund companies to create balanced ETFs, very low cost,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=3205" target="_blank">00:53:25.060</a></span> | <span class="t">balanced ETFs that do, let's say, a life strategy fund at Vanguard. In fact, Vanguard hasn't even created</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=3212" target="_blank">00:53:32.260</a></span> | <span class="t">a life strategy ETF yet that we could use, say, in an IRA. Why is that? Do you have any idea?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=3220" target="_blank">00:53:40.100</a></span> | <span class="t">David Stein: So I think that probably just one practical operational reason is that target date</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=3225" target="_blank">00:53:45.780</a></span> | <span class="t">funds, they've been used most often within the context of a 401k plan. The 401k plans,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=3232" target="_blank">00:53:52.420</a></span> | <span class="t">their pipes and plumbing aren't set up to hold ETFs. And so I suppose from that standpoint,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=3238" target="_blank">00:53:58.180</a></span> | <span class="t">if they're just to look at it as capitalists, they would conclude it's not worth their while to develop</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=3242" target="_blank">00:54:02.100</a></span> | <span class="t">these because they can't put them in the place where they enjoy the most uptake. But I completely agree</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=3247" target="_blank">00:54:07.140</a></span> | <span class="t">with you that from just from an overall investment utility standpoint, they make a great deal of sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=3254" target="_blank">00:54:14.180</a></span> | <span class="t">David Stein: You know, particularly, you know, maybe they would need to get a little bit creative</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuwIWfEzaQ&t=3258" target="_blank">00:54:18.580</a></span> | <span class="t">on the fixed income side.
