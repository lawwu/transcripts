Today's show is sponsored by Innovator ETFs. Before</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=22" target="_blank">00:00:22.440</a></span> | <span class="t">we got on today, I was explaining to Duncan how these buffered ETFs work. So, what they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=27" target="_blank">00:00:27.400</a></span> | <span class="t">have is three different buffers, a 9%, a 15%, and a 30%. Basically, what you have is that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=34" target="_blank">00:00:34.120</a></span> | <span class="t">how much protection you get to the downside. So, let's say the market is down 20%-ish now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=38" target="_blank">00:00:38.120</a></span> | <span class="t">If you had a 9% buffer, you'd be down 11%. If you had the 15% buffer, you'd be down 5%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=44" target="_blank">00:00:44.380</a></span> | <span class="t">If you had that 30% buffer, right, you're still protected. But I think it protects you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=49" target="_blank">00:00:49.020</a></span> | <span class="t">from -5 to -35. Anyway, each of them, the bigger the buffer, the lower your cap is on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=54" target="_blank">00:00:54.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the upside. Interestingly enough, though, they make these strategies using options.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=59" target="_blank">00:00:59.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And the more volatile the market, the better priced your options can be, right? So, actually,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=63" target="_blank">00:01:03.720</a></span> | <span class="t">your cap is a little higher these days, Innovator tells me.

That's why I had a bunch of questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It's interesting, yeah. Again, listen to our old animal spirits with Bruce Bond, we kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=86" target="_blank">00:01:26.760</a></span> | <span class="t">of go through them back and forth. But they're going to be sponsoring the show for a while,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=89" target="_blank">00:01:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">so we'll kind of go through some of the pros and cons of those things. But it's an interesting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.900</a></span> | <span class="t">way to define a range of outcomes. Okay, YouTube comments from last week since I talked about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=97" target="_blank">00:01:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the housing market a little bit. Someone said, "Okay, Ben, you're kind of pessimistic about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=101" target="_blank">00:01:41.280</a></span> | <span class="t">what's happening in the housing market right now. What's the best case scenario?" Okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.880</a></span> | <span class="t">so let me lay out the glass cephal. Higher rates cause prices to stall out for a bit,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">especially in places like Boise and Austin that have these really hot housing markets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's say inflation comes in a little bit, the Fed tightening slows things down. Mortgage</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.440</a></span> | <span class="t">rates can come back to a more normal level for people, which I don't know what normal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=123" target="_blank">00:02:03.640</a></span> | <span class="t">is these days, but I don't know, call it 4 or 5%. Millennials are still in their household</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">formation years, so they're going to be buying houses. And maybe things just get back to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">where supply and demand are a little bit more in balance. But the question really depends</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">on what kind of perspective you're talking about. First, a homebuyer or someone who owns</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.680</a></span> | <span class="t">a home? Because obviously, if you're a current homeowner, you want things to keep going higher,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.880</a></span> | <span class="t">but that's not very fair to other people. So, for everyone involved, I would just like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.720</a></span> | <span class="t">to see more homes being built. So, John, pull up this chart that I created a while ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Number of homes built by decade. You can see the 2010s was by far the lowest of any decade</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.960</a></span> | <span class="t">since the 1970s. This is really what we need to do. Unfortunately, it's probably a pipe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">dream because, as we can see with how cyclical things are, homebuilders are probably not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">going to do this unless they're incentivized. So, David Halberstam has this book called</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.620</a></span> | <span class="t">The 50s. I've referenced it a bunch on my blog and on Animal Spirits before. And he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.160</a></span> | <span class="t">talks about how the Great Depression and World War II really crushed the housing market.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">They just didn't have enough houses. They estimated when people got back from World</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.540</a></span> | <span class="t">War II, all the soldiers came back, they needed over 5 million homes. You know what the government</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.040</a></span> | <span class="t">did? They rushed this federal housing bill through, and it had very little in the way</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.140</a></span> | <span class="t">of controls. So, it basically, they did this federal insurance program to protect builders</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">by any means. And they offered, like, mortgage guarantees, and the builders just went crazy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So, they said in 1944, there was 100,000 new homes being built. By 1950, it was 1.7. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.560</a></span> | <span class="t">they built a bunch of homes. There was one thing in the book where they said down payments</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.280</a></span> | <span class="t">were either negligible or $1 for a new home. So, and they were selling $11,000 houses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.520</a></span> | <span class="t">That's like $133,000 in today's dollars. So, unfortunately, that's the pipe dream. I honestly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.300</a></span> | <span class="t">think the only hope we have is, say, by the end of the decade, the baby boomers all begin</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.780</a></span> | <span class="t">to downsize and sell their homes. And that brings supply and demand a little bit more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.380</a></span> | <span class="t">into balance. Obviously, if rates stay high here for a while, I think that's gonna help.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.420</a></span> | <span class="t">I really wish there was a way to make it more affordable for more people to buy homes. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.140</a></span> | <span class="t">I think building is the answer. But unless the government steps in and really does something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.420</a></span> | <span class="t">and I'm not holding my breath on that, I don't know that there's a very good answer here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Unless rates just stay higher for a while and just keep people on the sidelines.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I mean, you look at the calculators now of how much home you can afford, and yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">it's gotten worse. Last year, it already felt, or months ago, it already felt pretty bad.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.240</a></span> | <span class="t">But yeah, with mortgage rates going up, it's worse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. And I do think, hopefully, having rates be much higher will at least put a cap on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.560</a></span> | <span class="t">those prices. And maybe, especially in the busiest and hottest housing markets, will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">bring it down a little bit. So, we'll see. That's, unfortunately, my best case scenario.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Still not very great. But that's where we are. All right, let's do the first one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, up first today, we have a question from Adam, who writes, "In the era of free money,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.480</a></span> | <span class="t">having 2% to 3% interest debt for things like a car and a house were easy to take on because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">your investment returns made it worthwhile. However, in the current economy, should I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.160</a></span> | <span class="t">use money I would be putting into a brokerage account to pay off my house and car early?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Even at 2.8% interest, that's way higher than what stocks are paying right now. And real</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">estate has been a great hedge against inflation in the current market."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.060</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. This, again, depends on what perspective you're looking at it from. So, this is from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Adam.

So, the longest duration, which is zero coupon. Then I looked at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=535" target="_blank">00:08:55.320</a></span> | <span class="t">20 to 30 year treasury, all the way down to one to three year treasury.

It's in a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=554" target="_blank">00:09:14.600</a></span> | <span class="t">12 or 13% drawdown right now.

So, it really depends on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=563" target="_blank">00:09:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">what kind of bonds you're talking about here in the duration. But I can't say for certain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=569" target="_blank">00:09:29.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that this viewer thinks bonds are going to continue to get crushed.

Interest rates could continue to go higher. But here's the thing that's different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=578" target="_blank">00:09:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">this time around. Because rates are now higher, you actually have a little bit of a cushion</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=582" target="_blank">00:09:42.040</a></span> | <span class="t">for once. It's not like treasuries are coming from 50 basis points all the way up and you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=586" target="_blank">00:09:46.440</a></span> | <span class="t">have no yield to protect you. So, bonds getting crushed means bond returns in the future are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=591" target="_blank">00:09:51.800</a></span> | <span class="t">higher. Because starting yield really matters. And because if you look at expected returns,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=597" target="_blank">00:09:57.880</a></span> | <span class="t">bonds are guided by math. Not over the short term, but over the long run. So, stocks, their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=602" target="_blank">00:10:02.360</a></span> | <span class="t">yes fundamentals like earnings growth and dividend yield, these things matter. But the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=606" target="_blank">00:10:06.440</a></span> | <span class="t">other piece of stock market returns is, what are investors willing to pay for them? We've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=610" target="_blank">00:10:10.200</a></span> | <span class="t">been seeing this year, not only have stocks been coming down, but P/E ratios have been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=613" target="_blank">00:10:13.640</a></span> | <span class="t">coming down even faster, right? And P/E ratios are really, evaluations of all kinds, are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=619" target="_blank">00:10:19.240</a></span> | <span class="t">really emotions. Like, what are people willing to pay for stocks or the stock market? Bonds</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=623" target="_blank">00:10:23.460</a></span> | <span class="t">are guided by math. So, let's, John, throw up this first one of five year treasury yields</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=626" target="_blank">00:10:26.720</a></span> | <span class="t">versus one year returns. So, this is a starting five year treasury yield going back to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=631" target="_blank">00:10:31.400</a></span> | <span class="t">60s. And then, the orange line there is forward one year returns. You can see they're all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=636" target="_blank">00:10:36.360</a></span> | <span class="t">over the map. It's kind of in the same general direction over time, the highs and lows. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=642" target="_blank">00:10:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">it's way, way wider than the ranges. So, the correlation here between five year yields,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=646" target="_blank">00:10:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">starting yields and one year returns is like 0.6. It's got a relationship, for sure, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=650" target="_blank">00:10:50.920</a></span> | <span class="t">it's positive. But it's not perfect. So, now let's go out a little further. Let's go to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=654" target="_blank">00:10:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">three year returns, right? This is starting five year treasury yields versus three year</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=658" target="_blank">00:10:58.720</a></span> | <span class="t">forward returns. Now, we're looking a little closer here, right? The correlation is closer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=662" target="_blank">00:11:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to 0.8. You can see, but there's still some wide swings where returns get a little wider</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=668" target="_blank">00:11:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">than or lower than the actual starting yield. And now, let's do the last one. Five year</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=672" target="_blank">00:11:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">yields versus five year returns. Now, we're pretty close. The correlation here is like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_vGqvu8OAc&t=675" target="_blank">00:11:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">0.92.
