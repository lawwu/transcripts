Why aren't you sitting there collecting cash back? I really think there's two different pieces to this. So the first piece is that they make travel possible in ways that cash doesn't always make practical. I can almost guarantee that anybody who's not focusing right now on earning miles and points could be traveling more or more comfortably or both if they're learning to maximize miles and points.</p><p>The other big piece of it for me is that it's kind of a psychological thing. I think we all like getting a deal. And the thing with miles and points is that that discount is often significantly higher. So, you know, we're looking at saving 60 or 70 or sometimes like, believe it or not, 90% or more.</p><p>That takes things that are just impossible and brings them within reach. Miles and points create these opportunities for far outsized value. And that's exciting and fun. You know, when you get on a plane and you know that you paid 90% less than somebody else on that plane, there's an exciting element of that.</p></div></div></body></html>
