Basically a housing crisis in the metaverse and predecessors to the metaverse on as early as Ultima Online when I was 19.</p><p>This is this online game that you could play and you could build houses in the game and put them down somewhere. And what I found was that houses were actually like fairly cheap, like you could work long enough in the game to be afforded to buy blueprints for a house, which you put it somewhere, but there was no land to put it on.</p><p>And I at the time, I thought, Oh, I guess the server filled up. I didn't really think much about it. I was like, this stinks. I didn't join the game early enough. I'm screwed out of housing. And then I forgot about it. And then 20 years later, I checked back in and that housing crisis is still ongoing in that game.</p><p>That game is still running a good 25 years later. And that housing crisis remains unsolved. And you have this entire black market for housing.</p></div></div></body></html>
