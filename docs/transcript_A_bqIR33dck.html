Boldly I've approached my Father, clothed in Jesus' righteousness. There is no more guilt to carry, it was finished upon the cross. There is no more guilt to carry, it was finished upon the cross. Death was once my great opponent, fear once had a hold on me.</p><p>But the Son who died to save us, rose that we would be free indeed. Death was once my great opponent, fear once had a hold on me. But the Son who died to save us, rose that we would be free indeed. Yes, He rose that we would be free indeed.</p><p>Free from every plan of darkness, free to live and free to love. Death is dead and Christ is risen, it was finished upon the cross. Onward to eternal glory, to my Savior and my God. I rejoice in Jesus' victory. It was finished upon the cross. It was finished upon the cross.</p><p>It was finished upon the cross. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.</p><p>There's like, there's like, there's like prime seating right up here in the front. If some of you guys want to move forward, this is the time to do it. As always, there is extra blessing right here. It'll cause you just to be so much better. So we'll get started.</p><p>So we'll get started in just one minute. So we'll get started in just one minute. So we'll get started in just one minute. So we'll get started in just one minute. Okay. So we'll get started in just one minute. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So people are still coming in.</p><p>Okay. So people are still coming in. Again, if some of you guys would like to come forward to the very, very front, you can. Okay. Now, just by way of a couple introductory remarks, I am going to be teaching the four sessions for this class on parenting. And I tried to give you the outline of some of the topics that we'll be discussing.</p><p>Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So in terms of Q and A today, we don't have a Q and A, but if you have certain specific questions resulting from the lesson, my email is up there for those of you guys who are a bit newer. And you can message me and then I'll try to prep some ones that I feel like, oh, this may be on the minds of a lot of our members and try to address those questions.</p><p>Okay. So, um, and then, you know, with the topic of parenting, there's a sense in which it's a little bit tough, uh, because there's a, there's so much wisdom that plays into the decisions you make and how you rear your children. Uh, there is so much wisdom about who you are, what you're capable of doing, plus wisdom of observing your child, you know, but our hope and desire is that we're going to be walking through various principles of the scripture and just seeing God's overarching design for every family.</p><p>So let's pray and then ask for God's blessing as we jump into this very important topic. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we thank you so much, God. We praise you, Lord, for the grace, the light, the truth, and the spirit you give to us. Thank you so much, God, for the opportunity, uh, to be here together and learning, learning from your word.</p><p>Thank you so much, Father God, for granting to us the unique, unique privilege to parent children, uh, to be in a body where we're encouraging one another to value the children, Lord, and to value the family. For God, these are all things under your design with your purposes and to your glory.</p><p>So we pray that God be our ambition to fulfill your design for us. We ask you would grant the strength, the power, the motivation, the endurance to do so. It's in Christ's name. Amen. Okay. For those of you guys who are coming in, please come on down and don't be afraid to sit right here.</p><p>Okay. There's some empty seats right here. Well, by way of just thinking through a little bit, here's an interesting question. You know, what would be to us in our day, the great problem or hindrance that would cause our parenting to be difficult and go astray? Would it be the situation that the world becomes more and more liberal, secular?</p><p>There's a lot of influences all around every, in every kind of environment from politics to schools, et cetera, or is it more than that? And I'm, I'm guessing if you were to take a moment to think about it, I mean, for us in our context, how much of the world are we hearing and saying, Oh, I think they're right.</p><p>You know, here's an interesting question. You don't have to raise your hand, but how many of us in this room come from broken families where our parents have divorced, right? I am one. Or not only was it just because of divorce, but because the home itself coming from an immigrant family, I don't blame them because they had to do what they had to do.</p><p>But at the same time, their model was just survival. So question, how many of you guys were latchkey kids who after school, rather than getting picked up, you just walked home, made yourself some hot pocket. And then you made yourself dinner. You did your, and you just rushed to do your homework before your parents got home.</p><p>And that was you, right? So actually this one raises a hand. How many of you guys would consider yourself when you guys are growing up latchkey kids? Yeah. Bunch of you guys. Okay. So number one, actually, it's not so much like the evil influences of the world that's trying to threaten our homes.</p><p>A lot of times we don't have, we may not have had the kind of experience from when we were children. A limited examples that were fruitful, biblical, spiritual. But then, I took some time in preparing for these lessons to think about what would be the great hindrance to my parenting.</p><p>And truthfully, it's just more closer to just me. The great threat to my parenting is my own negligence. The great threat to my parenting is more so not there, but more so because I get so blindsided by my priorities, by what I'm trying to accomplish, or what I think is good for me, that time goes so fast and I'm negligent of various priorities.</p><p>And the reason why I bring this up is just by way of introduction. Then, we have the cards stacked against us, don't we? That means we have the world outside who does not share our values. That means we ourselves are prone to neglect. And then, there's this passage which says, you know, all of time is going towards this trajectory.</p><p>Which is that in the last days, difficult times will come. For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, revilers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy, unloving. Oh, great. So, embedded into the nature of mankind as it heads towards the end, the end times, there's going to be a natural propensity to break the family, to disobey parents, to be so self-consumed, right?</p><p>And so, this is why for us, we have to have this extra level of the things we know we regularly want to rededicate ourselves, the things we know we want to rehearse, teach each other, remind, encourage, and practice. So, I'm super encouraged that all of you guys are here.</p><p>I'm looking at the room and some of you guys are, I guess you could say, veterans far beyond my knowledge. You know? Some of you guys are just walking into being newly parents. And some of you guys young are looking forward to prepare for this very, very important endeavor.</p><p>So, we all know, by way of introduction, that it is very, very difficult. And there's a sense in which, around us, even near us with our own children, and then even our own flesh, there's going to be difficulties from all sides. So, then, what do we say? What do we do?</p><p>Well, how many of you guys have heard this saying, it takes a village to raise a child? Okay? It takes a village to raise a child. You've heard it said that it takes an entire village. Let me just tell you now, I don't like this statement. No, it doesn't.</p><p>No, it doesn't. Because I have a hard time prioritizing, would I place the rearing of my children on you? Well, guess what? My guess is, if I asked you how many of you guys have seen a generation of people who was hoping to drop off the children at church, hoping they would become good citizens, noble, filled with character.</p><p>Again, I'm not just trying to fault our previous generation that had such a difficult time, like a difficult life, but people bought into that idea of, like, the community needs to rear my children. Well, guess where this phrase is coined? Number one, it's an African kind of idiom that's lasted for a while, but it got popularized by Hillary Clinton.</p><p>She wrote a book called "It Takes a Village to Raise a Child." She was a proponent of societal ownership of children. Why? Because the government knows better how to raise kids than the parents. I don't like this phrase. At the same time, if you said it, don't feel bad.</p><p>Why? Because I understand what you mean. You're just so thankful that we are in a community, encouraging each other, helping each other along. And you're watching my kids, I'm watching your kids, and we're totally contributing, totally contributing to the safety and protection of our children. Praise God for all of you.</p><p>But, I would not put that burden on you. Right? I wouldn't come to you and be like, "You gotta disciple my son." But, that kind of stuff happens. Encourage. I want to encourage you now. There are so many subtle things that takes away from the confidence of parents. And, nowadays, I feel like, yes, it's really good to have parenting classes and programs like this, which will encourage you.</p><p>But, you already know coming here, I'm going to actually repeat a lot of things you know. What actually is also required is the motivation. The encouragement to persevere to what's right. The kind of bolstering of confidence to say, "Yes, I am maybe young. Yes, maybe I may not be experienced.</p><p>I didn't have lots of experience working with kids before. But, I'm the parent." And, therefore, you have confidence. So, please also, try not to say this. I don't know what I'm doing. And, I know a good number of you guys have said that in humility. And, also, sometimes just being at your wits end because you've tried this, you've tried that.</p><p>And, your child just won't listen to you. That kind of thing. And, I get it because, honestly speaking, so much of scripture is easier said than done. And, my own flesh, from my own experience, there are times when I think, "Oh gosh, I don't know what I'm doing." However, this phrase as well, please try to remove from your verbiage.</p><p>And, I mean it. I'm not like a motivational speaker where like, "Hey, you speak things into existence. Your words have power, et cetera." But, when it comes to parenting, God has given you a confidence to do it. And, it betrays our trust in God when we say stuff like, "I don't know if I can." Or, "I don't know what I'm doing." And, like, sentiments of giving up.</p><p>I want to encourage you not to do that. Why? Because, God has given you confidence in such a way that is so similar to the apostles and the church. The work that the apostles had to do was so massive, it completely, on a tangible, administrative level, the sheer numbers completely outweighed anything they were possible of doing.</p><p>Right? When we saw Apostle Paul's word to young Timothy, who was to shepherd the flock over at Ephesus, Timothy was supposedly a young man. So, what does Apostle Paul say? "Prescribe and teach these things. Let no one look down on your youthfulness, but rather in speech, conduct, love, faith, and purity.</p><p>Show yourselves an example of those who believe." He said, "Don't let anybody look down on you because you're young. But you be the model, you be the example, and those words are the exact same for you as a parent." Don't let anybody tell you, like, "Oh, you don't know what you're doing.</p><p>You need a professional." Don't let anybody say that to you. It's not arrogance for you to say, "I'm gonna parent my child. I'll be the greatest influence in the life. I'll have the greatest say because they're my kids." That's not arrogance. For some odd reason, there has been what I like to call a misplaced humility.</p><p>Thinking that, "Oh, you know, I gotta expose my kids to this environment. And I gotta expose my kids to this kind of, you know, variety and da-da-da-da-da-da." No, no, no. God said, "I'm going to set you as the primary representative of God Almighty. And you're going to be the teacher.</p><p>You're going to be the discipler." It's not arrogant for you to say, "I am ambitious to play that role." Right? So let's have that kind of mentality. But what's more, I am talking about the fact that God has given us this confidence by granting to us, okay, all that's needed to carry out this responsibility.</p><p>When we think about what we need as parents, I want to just not belabor the point, but just make this point simple. In the same way, again, church ministry is set upon the sufficient word of God, you and I know, that so is our parenting. Amen? So I ask this next question, then what is successful parenting?</p><p>Successful parenting is measured by what the parents do, not necessarily by how the children respond. Okay? I want to encourage you, because why? When do those words like, "Oh my gosh, I don't know what I'm doing," right? When do those words come out? It's because you see your child reacting, you see your child not obeying, you see your child misbehaving, and all of a sudden, there's this thought in your head like, "It's not working.</p><p>It's not working." But imagine if that was the mentality within the church. Pastor Peter is preaching faithfully, and another church pastor comes and says, "Hey, I don't think that's going to work. It didn't work at our church." You guys already know where that's going. And to this crowd, you guys know that just because somebody responds in a poor, negative manner, we never say, "Oh, that doesn't work that way." Right?</p><p>When it comes to the faithful and regular preaching of God's Word, okay? I want to remind you that when it comes to the Scripture, in Romans chapter 7, what the Scripture told us was this: "The Word of God is good. It is not evil." Right? But there has been a long, long history of the Israelites rebelling constantly.</p><p>So it was asked this question: "So what is it? What's the problem? Is the law evil? Because it's just constantly inspiring more evil?" And the explanation from Romans chapter 7 was, "No, no, no, no, no, no. The law of God is good. It's pure. It's your soul evil." Right?</p><p>Expect that whenever you teach, the children that we see so dearly, the children that we see so precious, their flesh is going to react from day one. From day one. The perspective that we have is that we are going to start training our children really early. I didn't have time to put this into the lesson.</p><p>I may work it in at a future time. But I believe that even discipline can happen before the child can speak. There are people who will say, "You can't spank a baby." Well, it depends. Can you sometimes tell that a child is revolting and rebellion? You sure can. There are babies who can't speak who will take a swipe at your face because they are unhappy, aren't they?</p><p>You have to correct and discipline. Training happens super early. What I'm trying to say is, yes, there are passages like this. Proverbs chapter 22, verse 6. Where it says, "Train up a child in the way he should go. Even when he is old, he will not depart from it." Now, what it sounds like is, if you train the child early, then he's going to stay for sure.</p><p>But you guys know, as good Bible students, that we don't read the Proverbs like locked, exhaustive promises for every situation. What is this Proverb actually trying to say? The idea is, when you start training early, it's going to build a habit that will last. Right? So the idea, actually, is you better start early.</p><p>You better start training. Why? Because, actually, you guys have probably felt it itself. The child missed their young adolescence, when they're super young, from being trained, learned, like taught how to take a no for an answer. When you start trying to teach them when they're older, it's incredibly difficult, isn't it?</p><p>Okay? So, we have this wisdom from Scripture that's teaching us, not by way of promise that if you provide all the right things when they're young, sure, they're always going to stay, but rather this idea that the training and the instruction must happen early. My point, actually, in saying all this stuff was that your determination of what successful parenting is, please do not make it because, oh my gosh, my child is now 10 and he's still rebelling against me.</p><p>Right? What am I doing wrong? Remember, success in parenting wasn't just because your child spoke back to you. It wasn't because, oh my gosh, my child still doesn't know how to behave. The success in parenting more so has to do with your faithfulness. How consistent are you? The success in parenting has to do with how eager are you to get involved in the child's life, physically being present, mentally being present, to address every single time.</p><p>And without frustration, without complaint, without throwing up your hands and saying, that's enough, how many times do I have to correct him? You're faithful. And I want to encourage you guys with that. I want to encourage you guys with that. And just this idea that, like, there are some of you who, again, at our church, we've been saying this, I want to repeat.</p><p>Your own personal walk with God, where you are going to church, you are doing devotions at home, you are trying to think about God when you go to work, and you're just trying to walk with him. You don't know yet exactly what to say to the child, but you're telling the child, come with me.</p><p>Walk with me. And if you're showing him your devotion to God, do not underestimate how powerful that is. I just want to, again, give you guys that encouragement today that you can have the confidence in God to be faithful. If your success was based on your child just simply bearing fruit, then a lot of individuals, whether it be professors I know, pastors, elders, and you guys probably know individuals, they've done, for better or for worse, just about everything you can.</p><p>A lot of time, family trips, homeschool, church activity, camps, Bible memory, you know, like Bible bee mastery. They did everything only to see the child grow up and then walk away, to not be interested. Does that happen? It's a reality. But we don't go this backwards way and we say, because this thing, something must have been done.</p><p>No, no, no. And therefore, for us when we think success, so much of that is in the hand of God. Amen? Now that being said, I want to go to, as we're talking about just the encouragement for you to be faithful, we're going to the ideas of God's goals.</p><p>And so we're going to take a moment to slow down here. I said a moment ago that a parenting class is difficult because I can actually make this 20 weeks long and talk about all the details of what to do. You know? This is how you talk to your kid.</p><p>Stop negotiating with them. And I'm going to talk about that. You know, stop giving them 15 chances and count to three 15 times, because that's like 45 chances these children get, et cetera, et cetera. I can talk about all of that. But God summarized the parenting in this short paragraph.</p><p>And what I want you to notice, too, is I've been saying that your success is not necessarily dependent on the child. God's parenting model has so much to do with just simply you vested into Christ, the word of God richly dwelling in you, and your character growing as much as it can.</p><p>So take a look. It says here as a summary of God's goal in parenting. You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your might. These words which I am commanding you today shall be on your heart. You shall teach them diligently to your sons, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise up.</p><p>This is a passage worthy of you memorizing. Right? It's a passage worthy of you memorizing. It will set for you a vision statement for your parenting. This is the vision passage for our Berean soul ministry. And within it then, because we're a church and not parents, we say, we support the parents doing this.</p><p>That's our vision statement for soul. Okay? But I want you to kind of think about like, okay, so what's God's goal for parenting? And it begins with you, the parent. You have to love God with everything you've got. You have to love God with all of your heart, with your soul, and with your might.</p><p>And I want you to take a moment to think about this. The priority number one for you in parenting then is not setting up the most safe environment. It's not setting your child up for the trajectory of the most educated, well-balanced, most cultured, most experienced child. It's not setting your child up to be a leader in this community.</p><p>It's not setting your child up to be this child who is leg up above everybody else. And so he's got music, sports, experiences, and extracurriculars. Your number one goal in your parenting is I need to love God with everything. Okay? And this I want to just make mention how important it is.</p><p>There is nothing that frustrates a child when they look at you and you're nagging them like you have to go to church. You have to read. You have to pray. They look at you and you're like, but this doesn't mean anything to you. Right? You're trying to have me jump through hoops, but it doesn't mean anything to you.</p><p>We don't understand how much the child is observing us already making sense of our own heart. And so I want to give you this exhortation. In parenting, God's first priority was for you to worship him. Now, that being said, one of the common pitfalls that we run into is, again, because of our just like natural nature nature to when we have a to-do list just to take care of whatever needs to be taken care of.</p><p>Sometimes in the hustle and bustle of just trying to take care of the physical needs of the children, etc. Is it not the case that we're tempted to neglect our own personal devotions? Neglect. Sometimes like you just, you're doing worship, but your mind is like, I got to get out of here because da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.</p><p>You know what I'm saying? Just remember, one of your greatest parenting acts is going to be for you to prioritize your own personal worship and let your child see it and just tag along with you. They see your love, and they're following your steps, not just your voice. Okay?</p><p>Now, that being said, we move on to other things that you know. The Word of God should be on your heart. It should be on your lips. You should be on the ready because you guys know that if you are to teach them diligently and you're learning and stuff like that, the best conversations doesn't happen if you say, hey, son, every Friday at 2 p.m., we're going to do Bible study together.</p><p>The best conversations sometimes, even within church amongst friends, doesn't happen, you know, Wednesday night at 7 p.m., but it happens when you're eating and all of a sudden you're like, you know what I was thinking? Or in the midst of conflicts, like, dang, I just got in conflict with so-and-so.</p><p>And the realest, most applicational conversations happen then. And God says, you have to be on the ready. Let it fill your mind. Let it fill your heart so that in those moments, when you talk and you live life with your son, when you're walking here and walking there, and look at the way the passage reads, right?</p><p>Be so diligent that when you sit at your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise. The idea of your parenting is that as you go, you're going to be talking about God. You're going to be talking about his way. You're going to be talking about how his word applies.</p><p>Oh, right here. Right here. Right here where you turned in an assignment, and you felt so horrible because you got a poor grade, and you're mad and angry. What is that? I'm not saying have a Bible verse for everything, but question, in that circumstance, Can you give God's way?</p><p>Right? Or are you prone to give whatever is at the tip of your tongue? Like, it's okay. You're much better than this. I know you're better. Don't feel bad about yourself. What is God's way? That's something for us to think about. That's something for us. Okay? From that, I just wrote in there, talk personally.</p><p>And the reason why is because of this. All right. So I want to tell you a little bit of a story and also have us think about this. what this is. So there has been a lot of people who place great, great confidence in the Christian community on Christian professionals.</p><p>So as a pastor, I do get actually visitations from non-church members from outside of our church who are desperate for their children and ask me to disciple their son at another church. And I'm sitting there like, huh? What do you want me to do? But when I hear them, I break for them because I'm like, you love your son so much.</p><p>So some time ago, it's already been some time, but a sweet lady who is older than me came in and said, I go to a different church. I just heard about your guys' church and I just need help. And I'm like, why? And they said, my son is going into senior year.</p><p>He's thinking about colleges. He's so sharp and so smart. He got into some of the best ones. And all he cares about is school. I'm so worried. And then with their head down, she said, I know it's my fault because that's all I scolded him to do. I pushed him and pushed him.</p><p>And now he won't even talk to me because I moved him from eighth grade to this school. But because this school had a better program, I moved him here and then this school had a better thing. And I pushed him to do after school. And then he had no life.</p><p>He doesn't even know how to catch a ball. And he just kept going. Like all this stuff. She pushed him and pushed him. And then it dawned on her, he's going to leave me. And she said, he goes to church, but I know he's not Christian. Now I don't care if he goes to a good school.</p><p>I just want him to be saved. And then I'm thinking, you have to talk to him. And she's thinking, no, you have to talk to him. Because I'm the professional. You see what's happening? Yeah. So, number one, she could feel now, and my heart broke for her. I was like, you love your son, and right now your heart's in the right place.</p><p>Like, I want your son to be saved. So pray with her, you know? But for so long, since the child was young, he, if I asked him, what was your mom's number one goal? It wouldn't have been to love God. It would have been to get into the best school.</p><p>That was her number one goal. She moved him around for that. And so he was so embittered, she wouldn't talk to her about anything. But now she's trying to turn the ship around. But now my next challenge is, but is that work left to the professional when you're there every day?</p><p>Talk with him when you sit and eat. Talk with him before you go to bed. Talk, you know what I'm saying? Like, this isn't, again, this is not stuff new to you guys. But I'm just sharing that all around us, even with the great, even with the right posture of heart, they resort to the wrong things.</p><p>And so the next thing I want to ask you is the question of God's goal. As we think about God-centeredness in the home and child-centeredness in the home, I have to ask you these questions. When the scripture says, love the Lord with all your heart, do you think like, I want to tell my child and show my child that loving God is the greatest goal I have for them?</p><p>So my question to you is, if I talk to your child, would they understand that? Would they know that? And for the couples here who have kids who can discuss with you, I challenge you to do it as a homework assignment. Sit down and talk with them and ask, what do you think, Oma and Appa, or, you know, Mom and Dad, want the most out of you?</p><p>What do you think we want? Like, the most out of you. Ask them. What is it that you think we push you the hardest on? What is it that we get the most worried about? And let the child respond to you. And even if, let's say, you're like, no, we say this all the time.</p><p>But if the child hasn't understood that, now we have homework to do, don't we? Now we have work to do. And I hope that's an exercise you don't skip. Next, an easy way to do this is, we preach all the time. Money and time is where the rubber meets the road.</p><p>So here's the next question. What activity currently deserves the most time? What dictates your schedule? If we're talking about the goal of walking in the Lord, especially in the early ages, it's really good that you take the early ages of development of a child, they absorb information like crazy.</p><p>It's incredible to me. I mean, our VBS kids, they hear a song twice, they got it. I'm still sitting here like, I don't know what I'm doing. Like, I can't do the motion. You know what I'm saying? They get it. Twice, they're done. They're singing it in the car, da-da-da-da-da.</p><p>Da-da-da-da-da. They absorb information like crazy. Teach them the scriptures. Help them memorize. Show them how good, how wonderful it is to taste of the Word of God. Do it, you know? But my point here was the time. What is dictating your schedule? Yes? And honestly speaking, this is such a practical, important one where you sit down and you say, "Hmm, let me look at my child.</p><p>What is my child tired from?" If they're tired because they ran to, you know, taekwondo, piano, whatever class, all in one day, and then they did tutoring, and they're just like, I'm spent. They have no energy. If you say, "Hey, do you want to pray with me?" And they're like, "Nope, I need to sleep." And we have some homework to do.</p><p>Okay? So next, today is more like the bigger picture of God's goal and foundations. And I do want to talk about a God-centered home versus a child-centered home. Okay? A God-centered home versus a child-centered home. As early as possible, get on the same page with you and your spouse that God will run this home.</p><p>Okay? And the child, because from day one they will let you know when they're not happy, that the child is not going to dictate how you manage this house. Okay? Get on the same page about that early on. What do I mean by that? Again, this is not trying to be, like, tough, and this is not trying to be harsh or parent in a certain way.</p><p>But there are plenty of times I remember where I'm like, "Oh, no, like, you know, baby's not going to be happy, so we can't do that." Like, the thought runs through your head, right? "Oh, no, like, so-and-so is going to be grumpy, so we can't do that." But take some time to think about that.</p><p>It's like, so if the child gets a little older, he's going to learn really fast. If I throw a fit, I can make this entire family do what I want, right? If we're going out for dinner, and I do not like katsu curry, because we have that way too many times, all I have to do is throw a fit, and we're getting burgers.</p><p>I'm just telling you, even from picking meals, don't let the child allow their demands to become the way your house moves, right? It's completely right to let the child know you're going to be thankful for what you receive. You're going to thank mom and dad for every meal you get, and you're going to eat it well, right?</p><p>Because they're not in the posture or position of authority. But there are times when that is the case. So, when it comes to tone and pace, we want to make sure that God's authority, God's priorities, even if it's upsetting the child, we are making sure we're walking that way.</p><p>So I have some practical questions for you. If your child is a little older, do you ever feel like you're walking on eggshells to avoid upsetting your child? Why? Even the expression of anger and displeasure by the child, that has to be trained. They're not allowed to just express their displeasure like, "I'm not happy." Even your expression of that has to be trained.</p><p>Why? Because God says do everything without complaining and grumbling. Complaining and grumbling is like poison that makes things dirty. Use those words, okay? Now, I want to talk about this a little bit because not only can it be child-centered, but obviously the home can be man-centered in that the parent turns to an extreme, like a dictatorial kind of home.</p><p>Okay? For the sake of time, I'm not going to talk at length about the raw discipline, the discipline of spanking, the discipline of removing privileges, right? Tangible consequences that happen, okay? There are verbal corrections that happen, just admonishment, verbal encouragement, reiteration of instruction. There are things like that, right?</p><p>Well, typically, when the child is young, the rod is high and the verbiage is low. Why? Because what they understand is immediate input, okay? They're not going to sit there reasoning, reasoning, reasoning, hoping they get you. They need to learn right away. Parents are authority. You need to obey, okay?</p><p>As the child gets older, that changes. It turns almost, phases out of the rod and it turns into verbal, okay? But in a dictatorial home, that rod is there all the time, okay? And so the parents end up becoming very demanding. The police, I know there's police individuals here.</p><p>We don't see you in a bad light, okay? In a sense, they're looking for bad guys, okay? They're looking for you to mess up. And if you parent like that, just watching for the next mess up, you are going to cause children to not live by principle. They'll be living in fear of your eyes.</p><p>And that's why there are children where they'll be like, oh, yes, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. And as soon as there's freedom, they go buck wild, right? Why? That means that there was kind of a training where you watch my mood. You watch my anger. And so in a kind of dictatorial kind of home, it's law-based.</p><p>It's full of just, like, instruction. You figure it out without a grace to support them. How do you accomplish this, right? Okay, why am I talking about this? Because this kind of dictatorial home is typically man-centered upon the parent. If you don't listen to me, you frustrate me. Don't make me mad.</p><p>I've heard that kind of stuff, right? You don't want to get me angry. Like, there's threats. Parents. Scripture tells us even in one to another, give up threatening. Do not threaten your children. The way it should work is there should be such consistency, okay, that they know by principle, when there's disobedience, there are consequences.</p><p>Okay? Not by principle, when there's disobedience, dad's going to lose it and fly off the handle. That shouldn't be their thought. They should be rising up above to the principles of God beyond you, okay? And so, therefore, in our parenting, it's so important to kind of think, like, is my irritation right now purely because of my inconvenience?</p><p>Is this me dictating, like, you better listen to me, right? Next, I think the more pervasive issues we have in our generation is more permissiveness on a gradient scale, right? Parents who rarely punish. Parents who are afraid of harming the self-esteem of the child. Parents who are afraid of upsetting the child, okay?</p><p>Just purely afraid, like, oh my gosh, I'm going to damage this kid, you know? Or parents who just, like, are so slow to react that they always lose the opportunity and they never get to it. That was me. Early on, I would just be like, what is this kid doing?</p><p>And then I would just be processing, like, what am I supposed to do right now, you know? And then I would just kind of, half of it was, I got to be honest with you, half of it was laziness. Like, oh my gosh, I'm so tired. I'm not going to do, like, a 20-minute session with this kid right now.</p><p>Like, why? Because my job is to talk all day. I don't want to talk for another 20 minutes. You know what I'm saying? So, to try to take my son to the bathroom for 20 minutes to talk to him, what's going on? Why are you so upset? What did you do?</p><p>Like, all that kind of stuff. I was just tired. And so, what ends up happening is, there were no consequences. Everything was a buy. Guess what happens? The results are, the children are self-consumed. The children are unruly. And interestingly enough, children who are in neglect of training actually learn to manipulate very quickly.</p><p>They learn to, because again, children you know are smart. Children are so smart. If they have cutes, they know how to use it. If they can see that you're emotional, they know how to be like, "I think Appa hates me." And you're like, "Where did you learn how to manipulate me like that?" They'll start accusing you like, "I think you don't know what you're doing." Like, the kids will start interpreting things so fast.</p><p>And then you realize, when there isn't strong strength of correction, they learn to manipulate very quickly. So, there was a great author who was an individual who we were close with, Wayne Johnston. He wrote a book called Biblical Parenting. And he just kind of wrote a segment on the God-centered home.</p><p>And I wanted to just paint for you the picture. And then for today, say, today is like vision day. Today is broader foundation of just God's goals, okay? He was describing that the parents are a light of salvation. Joyful for their salvation so much that, no, it wasn't the clean house that they were so concerned about.</p><p>They were so concerned about the salvation of the children, and the kids knew it. They knew their own responsibility to teach and train from Scripture, and the law of the house was God's words and not their preferences. What they demanded wasn't, "I told you," right? "Eight o'clock, you're in bed, washed up right now." God's law was the greatest thing that caused, right?</p><p>That kind of unsettling, like all that kind of stuff. And God himself was the God of the parents and God of the children. The house was filled with Christ's love. There were consequences for sins, but there was direction, instruction, and the truth of grace and help to change and loving restoration.</p><p>This home is filled with the application of God's word. This house is filled with the application of God's presence. This is the kind of God-centered home that we hope to present. If some of you guys had a certain very meticulous vision of your home, you know? I'm going to say a couple things, not assuming where you are, but confessing where I was.</p><p>A lot of my visions were, like, as a man, at a certain point when my boys are 10, we're going to have a house with a big backyard, three-bedroom minimum, you know? We're going to do this and that. My boys are going to learn how to change oil. And as a man, it's like, they're going to have grease on their hands, you know?</p><p>They're going to learn how to do this and that. And it's like, okay, cool, great, you know? But I've got to be honest with you. You guys kind of, you know, as I'm saying it even, I feel a little silly that I had those visions in my head. But all of that's just like, meh.</p><p>What am I going to do if they're in 12th grade about to leave my presence to go to college? They know how to change oil, but they hate God. They think the Bible doesn't make sense. They have all the typical, like, excuses, like, oh, then God's fair. The Bible's chock full of errors and all that kind of stuff.</p><p>What am I going to do? What have I made? Nothing. The answer is nothing. There's an answer to that question is I've made nothing. So, parents, by way of wrapping up, reviewing, today I wanted to encourage you. Do not be discouraged because your child acts in the flesh. For the rest of your life, your child will act in the flesh.</p><p>Right? Even when they're grown 45-year-old, you know, adults with their own kids, they may respond in the flesh. But you will be faithful. You will be faithful to advise them when they're older, counsel them. You'll be faithful to correct them and train them. Success, well, success is faithfulness. Okay?</p><p>Now, the next sections are going to talk about everything from your foundational theology. So, the next section next week is going to be about the perspectives of godly parenting. After that will be the characteristics, your character trait of the godly parent. And then, finally, the practices of the godly parent.</p><p>Those things we just have to be faithful in. Because God said for you to love Him, be filled with His Word and teach diligently. And in that way, we pray. We just pray our hearts out that we will have God-focused homes. Amen? Let's take a moment to pray. Heavenly Father, I hope that this evening was a time of encouragement.</p><p>And that we will be mutually edifying towards each other. Father God, we have children that, you know, in various range of ages, development. Sometimes various expressions of sin and more. Sometimes, Lord God, you grant us the grace to see the children mature and develop even in their spiritual state.</p><p>For all of it, God, we thank you for giving us this responsibility. For all of it, Lord, we praise you for granting to us this grace. To be used by you as under-shepherds to minister. I pray, Father God, that even if our hearts are a bit broken because we know we've neglected important things, help us to rededicate ourselves.</p><p>Even if, Father God, we had failures, failures of our own self-control and whatnot, I pray that we would rededicate ourselves. And God, your call for us has not been to play your part and bear the fruit, but to obey your call to be faithful. Help us, Lord, to be steady, to follow after you.</p><p>We thank you in Christ's name. Amen. Okay. Well, thank you, everybody. The last thing I want to say is for the questions you may have after each session, again, you can email me to marklimb at bariancc.com. Not today, but for the next week, if I can work in a Q&A section, I will.</p><p>And if I feel like, oh, you know, there's actually a lot of great questions coming in, I may put just an end segment where do we open Q&A. Okay? All right. Thank you, everybody. We appreciate your time. We appreciate your time.</p></div></div></body></html>
