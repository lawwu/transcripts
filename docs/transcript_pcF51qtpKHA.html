(laughing) - Yes. - Why, do you think ego is powerful or dangerous in science? - I think both, both, both. I think you have to have both arrogance and humility. You have to have the arrogance to say, I can do this.</p><p>Nature is difficult, nature is very, very hard. I'm smart enough, I can do it. I can win the battle with nature. On the other hand, I think you also have to have the humility to know that you're very likely to be wrong on any given occasion. Everything you're thinking could suddenly change.</p><p>Young people can come along and say things you won't understand and you'll be lost and flabbergasted. So I think it's a combination of both. You better recognize that you're very limited and you better be able to say to yourself, I'm not so limited that I can't win this battle with nature.</p><p>It takes a special kind of person who can manage both of those, I would say. - And I would say there's echoes of that in your own work, a little bit of ego, a little bit of outside of the box, humble thinking. - I hope so. - So was there a time where you felt, you looked at yourself and asked, am I completely wrong about this?</p><p>- Oh yeah, about the whole thing or about specific things? - The whole thing. Wait, which whole thing? - Me and me and my ability to do this thing. - Oh, those kinds of doubts. First of all, did you have those kinds of doubts? - No, I had different kind of doubts.</p><p>I came from a very working class background and I was uncomfortable in academia for a long time. But they weren't doubts about my ability or my, they were just the discomfort in being in an environment that my family hadn't participated in. I knew nothing about as a young person.</p><p>I didn't learn that there was such a thing called physics until I was almost 20 years old. - Yeah. - So I did have certain kind of doubts, but not about my ability. I don't think I was too worried about whether I would succeed or not. I never felt this insecurity, am I ever gonna get a job?</p><p>That had never occurred to me that I wouldn't.
