And so I buy this laundromat, but I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHdQ74Jw_j8&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">don't use my own cash to do it.

And at the end of three years,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHdQ74Jw_j8&t=129" target="_blank">00:02:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">great, you have your full 100K. And at the end of the three years, I own the business outright.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHdQ74Jw_j8&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is very common.

So think about your neighborhood wedding photographer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHdQ74Jw_j8&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">right?

It's a great little business for them, right? That's their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHdQ74Jw_j8&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">business. They do $100,000 a year. And when you take out their salary, which at this point,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHdQ74Jw_j8&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">they pay themselves the full amount, but let's say you take out their salary of like $60,000,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHdQ74Jw_j8&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">$70,000, that leaves $30,000 to $40,000 profit. That person, when they're done being a wedding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHdQ74Jw_j8&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">photographer and a high school photo photographer, they probably just stop and go do something else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHdQ74Jw_j8&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">But those contracts with the high schools are worth something, that residual revenue is worth</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHdQ74Jw_j8&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">something, their gear is worth something, their website, the SEO that's built up, all of these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHdQ74Jw_j8&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">jobs have inherent value to them.

But there's not a lot of that right now. So that wedding photographer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHdQ74Jw_j8&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">can't find you, the young new photographer that would love to buy that business because you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHdQ74Jw_j8&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the young photographer, are just thinking, "Oh, I'm just going to go start my own."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHdQ74Jw_j8&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">As opposed to, "What if I could buy it?
