I'm here with my guy, Bones. - My guy, MP STEVE. - Appreciate you on the podcast, my boy. - Yo. - Man, so I remember when you got drafted, you came in the locker room, said what's up to everybody, and we clicked, I think. I really appreciated your authenticity, and I noticed that just from the jump when we first met. - Yeah. - And then you just proved it over and over, like no matter what's going on, you're always gonna be Bones. When you're in the game, it don't matter who's in the game, you're gonna be Bones. And I just feel like we clicked, so I appreciate you hopping on the podcast, my brother. - Yeah, for sure. You know, definitely, being drafted by the Nuggets, it was definitely huge for me, you know. It was a blessing, you know, just overcoming what I overcame, you know, in my life. And then being drafted, 26th pick by the Nuggets, it was big for me, man, it was everything. I didn't really know what to expect, you know, coming to Denver. I thought it was really cold, but I got on the plane, and it seemed like the sun was out. I'm like, damn, this is different. It seemed like it's hot out. - Yeah. - But, you know, the first time I came to the arena, I think the first person I saw was you when I walked into the pool room, and I'm like, what's up, NP? But we definitely just clicked from there. You know, Genuine Vibes and Genuine Souls always, you know, connect with Genuine Souls, and ever since then, it's just been like a lock, for sure. - No, for sure. I remember, bro, like, I realized you were a killer, and like, it was your rookie season, right? And I think we were in training camp in San Diego, and I'll never forget this. I think I came down and like, hit like a heasy pull-up, but I think you were on the side, like, waiting for me to pass it, and you was like, I hit the shot, but you were like, Mike, like, I can do that, too. You can pass the pass, like, okay, like, he's cold. Like, and this is your rookie season, like, and you just were so confident, bro. So, it was like, it was a joy to watch you play, and like, be your teammate, you know? And then, so, I think I kind of was hurt during the time when you, when they were talking about the trade rumors, and when you, that's cool, that's his phone? Yeah, I think I was hurt during the time the trade rumors came around, so I really didn't know what happened, but man, now you're, you end up going to LA, and I've been tuned in, obviously, but how has everything been for you over there? Are you enjoying it? - Yeah, yeah, it's been lovely, man. It's been dope, obviously, coming from Denver, a situation where I thrived in, you know? I was having fun playing over there, stuff like that, but I just felt like it just needed a change for me, needed different scenery, and obviously, over here in LA, I think it's a beautiful thing for me. I'm learning under four future Hall of Famers, just staying ready, staying patient. Obviously, last year, I came around February time. You know, it was kind of hard just to learn, you know, it wasn't hard learning the plays or learning, you know, I mean, obviously, if you're a Hooper, you know you're gonna fit in with whatever, but just having to move from one state to another, one team to another, you know, having to learn the new staff, new players, everybody names, the play calls, it's tough, you know? And obviously, on top of that, you're still trying to perform, and you know, still trying to, you know, earn that roster spot as well, too, coming in from another team, but I feel like I did that, and obviously, this year, you know, just playing well off the bat, and then, you know, a trade happened, and you know, you just get bumped down and out of the rotation, but I feel like it's, you know, even though it may not look like it's a good thing for me, I still look at it as a good thing, 'cause I'm still learning under four future Hall of Famers, and I know my time will come, so I'm really not, you know, too down on it. Obviously, I wanna play, but I ain't too down, though. - Yeah, no, you always smiling, you always have had a good attitude about everything, even, you know, when things, like in Denver, you know, you know how the NBA is. Even in Denver, when things weren't going good, you always maintained a smile, and so I've been checking up on you, even in L.A., just because even times last year, you weren't playing as much as you were supposed to, or whatever, and now, but you have always just maintained, like, the attitude, the good attitude, and you're young, bro, you're gonna end up, you're gonna end up doing your thing, but that leads me to a question, like, you played so well, you know, obviously, in the off-season, you be killing every run, you know, and you just go, and, you know, you're like the highlight of the summer, everybody be looking at the Bones Highlands, Pro-Am videos, or whatever. How do you maintain, like, is the NBA, for people that don't know the NBA, is it as fun as the summer, like, is basketball as fun to you in the NBA, when you're playing, or not? Like, is it as fun as when you're doing your thing, in the summertime? - Yeah, I see what you're saying. That's a great question. I would say it's kinda different. You know, by the same time, I feel like if I had, you know, the keys, or if I had to, you know, just go out there and just be yourself, and, you know, with no leash on you, no minute thing going on, I feel like it'd be the same thing that's going on in the summertime, but the summertime, you just playing, you just playing, I feel like everybody's so in tune with me, you know, they love seeing me play, and just be free, and you know, they be like, man, if he just had, you know, the leash off of him, if he just go, he'd be-- - Everybody knows. - Yeah, everybody know, you know, but, you know, at the same time, I'm just waiting my turn, waiting patiently, but, man, the summertime, you know, who's be so fun, 'cause I could just really just go out there and just be me, you know? Even though I'd be me in the league, too, but it's more in spurt, like, it's like the whole time, the whole game, I'm just wilding. - Oh, yeah, you born in somebody's head. - I'm just wilding. - Did you always, like, okay, so, obviously, nowadays, a lot of people grow up with trainers, and they grow up with, you know, they go through drills. Your game is so unique, because the way you grew up, where you grew up, hooping, you know, on a park. How did that, because most, like, hoopers that grow up that way don't make it to the NBA. They don't know how to defend to structure and all that. How did you kind of grow up, and how did your game, like, how is it the way it is? Because the way you handle the ball is so unique, the way you, you know, the showtime, the flashiness. - Facts. - Like, is that just the way you grew up, or how did you grow up hooping? - Yeah, that's definitely the way I grew up. I grew up on a lot of park basketball, a lot of recreational basketball. Recreational basketball, however you say it. But, you know, I grew up on a lot of that, honestly, just playing, going to gyms, you know, playing one-on-one, two-on-two, three-on-threes, you know, literally all day. Like, sunup, sundown, you know. At first, like, it was kind of hard to get on the court, you know, 'cause they're like, you gotta wait your turn, you know, you're younger, you know. And I'm just on the sideline, just practicing my moves, you know, I'm just shooting the ball in the air, stuff like that, but just watching, just live basketball. You know, I've been taking so many notes and stuff, just young, and I knew, like, once I be able to get on the court, I knew I'd be ready. But, man, just how it just translated to the NBA, just honestly in the gym and just working. You know, try to, like, simplify some things, you know. You know, obviously, sometimes you can be a little flashy, you can show your flashes of, you know, being fancy here and there on a fast break. You can throw a dime, you can turn around, you know, just get the crowd into it. That's how I always been, you know. I never wanted to, like, change that or, you know, let somebody change that part of me because I'm a very, you know, entertaining player. A lot of people like seeing me play. They love watching me. So, it's like, I never just changed that because, oh, this doesn't fit the criteria of, you know, a coach like this or, you know, somebody don't like the way I play, dah, dah, dah. Nah, that's never been me because at the end of the day, it's like, I'm not gonna change who I am, you know. This is what got me here. I'm not just gonna change who I am now, you know, just because I made it to the league. No, I'm gonna forever be me. So, you know, that's definitely how I grew up, though. You know, a lot of park basketball. - Yeah, nah. Like I said, bro, that's one thing I admire. Like, can't nobody tell you, like, your confidence and just the swag you play with. Can't nobody tell you you're not the coldest. For people that don't know, like, me and Bones would have shooting contests after every shoot-around. - I'm crying. - Every shoot-around, we would do our little shoot-contest, me and him. Sometimes, other people would join, but they never would win. But I could say Bones is one of the only people, like, I've shot against. It's you, Steph, and, like, maybe one other person. - Yeah, probably Trey. - Trey, Trey. But, like, that can consistently beat me. Like, he would beat me most days. I would be so hot. But, like, as flashy as your game is, like, it's still very, very polished. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure. - Who did you grow up, like, who did you grow up idolizing? Who'd you try to model your game after? - You know, that's such a tough question. 'Cause I really never try to, like, modelize my game after nobody. I love watching hoop, though, you know? But, like, I love taking, like, flat, like, game, like, or my moves from different players and stuff like that. But I never went, like, oh, yeah, I just wanna be just like him. Like, this is my idol, da-da-da, you know? That's never been me. But a guy who, like, I always watch was Hot Sauce. Hot Sauce is the only guy, you know, I just watch. And that's somebody, like, I come home from school, you know, I eat a bowl of cereal. You know, I turn him on, on the phone, I prop the phone up, and after I finish eating my cereal, I grab the basketball and go in the mirror, and I just practice all his moves and stuff. With his big shirt on, you know, the big shirts he used to wear. - He was cold, he was cold, though. - Fatsy was cold. - So that makes sense, then, why you hoop the way you hoop. - I used to always just watch him, bro, and I'd just go to the gym and try to practice his moves, and it was working. But, like, I didn't wanna be too much, like, you know, doing way too much. Yeah, you know, but I still, like, try to, like, try to amplify some of that in my game, and that gave me, like, my flair, like, my swag, you know, like, you know, it gave me that, nah, I can't nobody, like, fuck me on the court type shit. You know, that gave me that vibe, though. - Yeah, it's a video that went viral, a YouTube video. I'd just seen it, like, like, I didn't even know about it 'til I started playing with you, but it's a viral video of you playing one-on-one. They was some bums, but you was going head dudes, and I think you were younger, and they was getting hot. - Yeah. - Yeah, y'all can look it up, Bones Island one-on-one. - I definitely know it was one you talking about, for sure. I just was watching it the other day. - But, like, how old were you during that? Like, was that, like, a normal thing for you to just go to the park and be playing one-on-one with dudes, and the cameras be out and all that? - Yeah, so, like, it's a big back story to that. So, you know, for everybody who don't know, this was a video that went viral. I was about 17 years old. But it's a league called Tech Rock League. It's a league that I played in growing up. A lot of, you know, kids went from Wilmington to Delaware, even, you know, Philadelphia area, you know, Tri-State area. A lot of people come down and play in the league. And, you know, it was one game that's going on, and we were waiting 'til it was done. And it was, like, me, it was, like, six other people, and it was the two owners that, you know, made the Tech Rock League up, you know? And, you know, we just conversating about basketball, you know, then they got to the comparison game. And I'm, like, I'm staying out of it. I ain't saying nothing. I ain't saying nothing. I'm staying out of it, you know? But then I got brought up, and I'm, like, nah. That's, like, hey, nah, y'all tripping. I'm not comparing to nobody. And they just kept saying, yeah, you know, I can beat him one-on-one. You know, I can beat, you know, Bones one-on-one, and da-da-da. And I'm, like, you tripping. It's a court right here. We can go check out right now. It's a court literally right here. We walked on the court, and the first guy, you know, I just feel like, you know, I don't know. I think it felt like his pride got in the way. - It did, it did. - He got in the way. - He was playing way, bro. - His pride got in the way too much. But the second guy, who was seven, though, his pride was way higher, though. Like, he knew, like, he just let the people where he was from, you know, he's from Philadelphia, but he let the people, like, get in his ear. Yeah, go out there and, you know, play and stuff. - He was trying to play it mad hard. - Mad hard. (laughing) And I'm, like, you know, it's not going to end how you want it to end. I'm just, like, nah. And I didn't even know that, like, this was going to be a viral video, though, bro. I was just going out there, just being myself, all the people around that was watching, everybody just being there. So, we didn't know that the guy who recorded the video, we didn't know he was going to drop it, or he was actually recording, you know? But it got so much attention and stuff. I'm, like, nah, he definitely going to drop this. And ever since then, that joint just blew up, bro. - That video is OD. - But you know what's crazy, though, bro? A lot of people, like, they, like, oh, that's the guy from the video that went viral. Like, they look at me now, like, wow, that's the guy from the video. - That's how viral that video is? - Yes, bro, like, to this day, like, that's the guy from the video that went viral. I'm, like, damn, they remember that video? That's crazy, bro. - Nah, it's a hilarious video, bro, 'cause it's just like you now, like, the way you talking crazy to dudes. And they were so hot, like, they were so mad, bro. - They definitely was. - But nah, nah, back to the league, like, I was watching a podcast, I think it was Emmanuel Moutier on someone's podcast, and he was just talking about he lost his love for the game. And, like, you've always been, like, you can see in that video, you can see, even the way you hoop now, your love for the game. He was talking about he lost his love for the game because of how political the league is. He was like, I would be killing somebody in practice every day, but the coach tells me I'm not gonna play right now. And, like, obviously, we've talked about Tyloo. Tyloo's from Missouri, like, that's my guy. That's like, he's from 30 minutes down the street from where I'm from, and he's the most chillest dude ever. - Yeah, he is chill, for sure. - But do you feel like, not just in your situation, but now that you've been in the NBA, how political do you feel like it is? Like, is it dudes to you, like, every day could be killing in practice that literally don't play in the game, or do you think the best players always play? - Yeah, it's definitely a political game, but it's something that you just can't control, bro. Like, you know, I could be killing every day in practice, you know, but it's just like, it's just gonna go how it go, because maybe somebody been there, you know, years, or maybe you're on a contract that's way bigger than yours, and it's just gonna go the way it goes. But, I mean, it's something that you really just can't control. Maybe he got a couple years over you, and you just getting in the league, or you're just your second year, but you killing, though. But, he on a crazy contract, you know, but he playing over you, playing, you know, mad minutes. But it's something that you, excuse me, it's really something that you just can't control, bro. - Right. - It's tough, you know, 'cause it's like, man, I wish I was playing a little bit more, you know. You know, I feel like I deserve to play a little bit more. You know, I'm already killing it with the minutes that I'm getting. Why can't I get a little bit, like, 10 more, you know? - Yeah. - Like, I feel like I deserve it, you know. But, man, it's definitely a political game, but it's just something that you just can't get caught up in, man. You just gotta stay, like, level-headed, you know, just stay out of that, man. - And you never let that affect, like, your joy? - Yeah. - You don't let it affect your joy? - Nah, not at all. You know me, bro. Like, I ain't gonna let nothing shake me, bro. It's like, but at the same time, it just be kinda tough, though, it do, because, like, you know, you just wanna play, bro. And that's me, like, I just wanna hoot, you know. So, it's like, ah, this political game could definitely get tough, but, man, it's something you just really can't control, bro. It's really something you can't, facts. - Nah, 100%, nah. You, I mean, you know, like, you a star. Everybody knows, I think I was watching PG's podcast, and he was talking about the way you play, how you are as a star. And you got, like you said, y'all got four Hall of Famers right now, like. - Yeah, bro. - And y'all still figuring it out, but whether it's there or somewhere else, like, you gonna blossom. So, it's never any stress in that area. I wanna turn to, like, your faith, because you do have an unshakable joy, which is something I've always appreciated about you. Even, like, when you were with us, I'd be down sometimes, you would keep my spirits lifted if something was wrong. - Facts. - Even if you weren't playing, you still were cheering me on in the game. - Facts. - But you tweet, or you put on Instagram very boldly, like, about your faith. - Yeah. - Like, in God, and just how important that is to you. Has that always been, like, an important part of your life, and is that kinda what keeps you kinda, like, level-headed through everything? - Man, yeah, man, that's the biggest part of my life, honestly, man, 'cause I done been through so much, but, you know, Jesus has never, you know, forsaken me at all. Like, he always been there for me, like, regardless, like, how, you know, impossible something may seem, how, like, un-extraordinary something may seem. It's like, he's just always there for me. And it's like, I can never, like, turn on him, no matter if, like, things get, you know, worse for me, or maybe I don't like how something's going, you know, or maybe some life problems that I'm going through. I just know, like, I'm always be, you know, straight, because I got, you know, God on my side, and it's never gonna make me, like, turn away from, you know, him because something not going my way. You know, I feel like a lot of people nowadays, like, they quick to, like, you know, why me, or, you know, why am I going through this, you know, but not even knowing, like, maybe this can, you know, help you, you know, on your path going forward. - Diversity can, like, shape you. - Yeah, exactly, you know, and I feel like that's something I'm going through right now. Like, this right now, it's shaping me right now. You know, it's building resilience in me, you know, it's building patience in me, you know, and it's building, like, just even more high character, you know, so it's something that I definitely, you know, appreciate right now, even though I wanna play, but at the same time, I know God is, you know, strengthening me, you know, getting stronger off the floor, you know, and stuff like that, so it's, I feel like it's really, it has helped me, but I think definitely never shake, though, at all. - Never, nah. You, we were talking about this before the podcast started, just about how, like, the fans, even in Denver, how people can be so for you. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - In life, in general, any NBA player deals with this. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - That people can be so for you, but as soon as you do one thing they don't like or they perceive something that's not even how it was, they turn on you, and I think we've talked about a little bit, even the Denver fans, 'cause you were a fan favorite. Like, every time you hopped on the floor, you're going crazy, and just the fact that you received backlash for any negativity, I asked AG this in my podcast the other day, how do you deal with the positivity and negativity? 'Cause there's been so much positivity surrounding you, but then one thing goes wrong, and now there's negativity, do you, how do you deal with all that? - So, honestly, man, I just be taking it like, all right, they just showing love because I'm killing, you know, or they, at this moment, they showing me love, but I don't let it get too head over heels, like, ah, I'm so in, you know, with the, you know, how they treating me and stuff like that. Like, obviously I love it, but it always, like, you know, something go wrong, they just gonna turn on you. It's just like, it's just what happens, bro. It happens to literally, like, you know, Hall of Famers who played and stuff like that. - The best players in the world. - The best players, bro. So it's like, of course it can happen to me, so I don't be too, like, locked in on it. Of course, like, I appreciate, you know, fan bases that, you know, take me in and, like, really cheer me on. They appreciate my game, they appreciate how fun I have on the floor, you know. Speaking of Denver fans, you know, when I was over there, you know, I checked in and they, they weren't, like, rowdy every time. Like, they love watching me play, but obviously the trade went down and it happened. Now it's, everybody just, like, hate me, like, you know, but I feel like they don't really, I feel like they don't really hate me. They still got love for me, but it's just the fact that I'm just not there anymore, it's making 'em kinda like, damn, like, we just gonna go at it, we just gonna keep, you know, going at it, even stuff like that, but I still got love for Denver, bro. Like, it took me in with open arms. Like, I never just say, like, F Denver. Like, that's never, you know, me, that, that won't ever come out my mouth. It took me in with open arms. Every time I checked on the floor, I had fun, you know, so. - Right. - Yeah, I don't know, it's something that, like, you just gotta, you just gotta just hoop, bro. You can't really get into the whole fan thing and all that, you know, you just can't get into that, bro. - Facts. You talked before, you was, like, talking about what has shaped you into this person is the things you've gone through. I remember, yeah, back in San Diego, when we was just chopping it up on the training table. I'll never forget this conversation. Like, I don't know how it came up, but you talked about what you went through and you was telling me, like, this is what, this is why I am, this is how I am, this is why I smile so much. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Can you talk a little bit to people, because I think, like, more than just a basketball player, like, you inspire so many people because, and people don't even know your story like that, but I do, and I, to see you smile through that, to see the way you take care of your mom and your nephew, like, people don't even know where all that comes from. Can you a little bit talk about the incident during high school? - Yeah, facts. So, back in 2018, you know, I had went through a house fire tragedy, you know what happened, and, you know, I was watching March Madness in my room, and I was on the phone with one of my friends, and, you know, I'm just literally just chilling, just laying back, and it's like a, I forget what day it was. You know, it was like a Saturday or not, I forget which one of those days it was, but, you know, I'm just chilling back, and it's one of those days where everybody just be, you know, chilling in the crib, like, nobody bothering each other, you know, everybody just resting and stuff like that, and, you know, I'm watching the game and stuff, and just chilling, and I just get up out my bed 'cause I start smelling, like, you know, smoke just surrounding just, like, my, like, just outside, like, and I'm like, damn, like, what's that smell? But, you know, like, that type of smell is normal for, you know, where I grew up, you know, and it's normal, people think it's a barbecue, you know, or it's a cookout going on, so I'm like, yeah, it's normal, so I just sat back in my bed, and it started getting more intense, intense, intense, I'm like, damn, what's that smell? Like, that's not like a barbecue, it smell like something burning, like something on fire. So, you know, I get out of my bed, and I had, you know, went to my door, and I had opened my door, and I just see all these flames just bursting, and I'm like, oh, shit, what the hell going on? So I instantly had to close the door, and I had went into my room, and I had to just sit there and just, like, think, like, damn, what the fuck am I supposed to do? And mind you, what's already clicking in my head is my grandma and my two baby cousins is in the other room, and I'm like, damn, like, how can I get over there to their room and see, you know, try to save them, or, you know, see what I can do, what plan I can do? But, you know, in movies, you can just think so, you know, they got all this time to think, you know, they go from one scene, you know, of the fire or something, and them try to, you know, escape that, and then they go to another scene, and then they come back to the fire, and then, it don't work like that, you know? That was something that, like, man, I really had to, like, think fast, you know, with such little time. And, you know, I'm just sitting down, I'm trying to really figure out how I'm gonna do this, but I live in an old house, so I'm like, the windows ain't gonna open, like, them windows never open, so I'm like, yeah, it might be over with for me. So I went to one of the windows to try to open, but, like, it didn't open, and now the smoke and everything is really getting, like, inside the room. Flames is starting to come in, the walls is getting hot. As I'm touching the windows, it's a little hot, so I'm like, ah, like, you know, I touched the first window, it didn't open. Now I'm really, like, cloudy, and I can't really see, you know? And I try to touch the second one, it's hot. I'm trying to open it, I'm like, nah, I'm just gonna go, like, it's really not opening for me. I dropped to my knees, I'm like, God, like, I really don't understand why this is happening to me. Like, I feel like I did everything I was, you know, supposed to do. I feel like I'm a great person to people. You know, I always, you know, give. You know, I never really, you know, I don't ask to receive from anybody. You know, I always wanna do my deeds, you know, in your honor. So I just be like, dang, man, this is, you know, crazy to happen to me. And, you know, as I'm just sitting down, I'm just praying, I'm like, man, if it's my time to go, I'm just gonna go, you know? But I just hear that voice in my head, like, get up, like, I got you, get up. And it's like, it's not your time to go yet. And he's like, you know, that window's gonna open to you, the third one. So I'm like, it's no way, bro, it's no way. So I get up, I get up, I go to the window, and I just try to just open it, and it's open. I'm like, wow, this is crazy. So I open up, I see somebody outside. I'm like, my house is on fire, my house is on fire. Come save me. He's like, you gotta jump, you gotta jump. I'm like, I can't jump, it's too high. It's a three-story floor house. I'm like, I cannot jump. You gotta jump, we need you, you our last hope. When I heard that, I'm like, damn, bro, like, I really am the last hope from Wilmington, Delaware. So small, everybody depending on me to make it, and stuff like that. So I'm just like, all right, fuck it. But after he said that, though, lie to you not, I went back in the room, got on, you know, my knees. I'm like, man, I'm just gonna go, I can't jump, it's too high. Just hear a voice in my head, God, just get up, just get up, just get up. I just said, fuck it, went out the window. I just jumped head first. I had to turn my patella tendon, I hit my knees on the bricks. I tried to get up and crawl, I couldn't walk. I tried to call to the car, you know, to the lady who had a phone. I'm like, call my mom, call my mom. My mom was at a place called Main Event. And, you know, she was there with, like, a couple of my other family members, cousins and stuff, just having, like, a fun day. I forgot my mom's phone number. So I'm like, I don't know what's going on. My head's spinning, you know, I can't walk, I can't do anything, you know. So I'm like, damn, I forgot my mom's phone number. Anybody know my mom's number? It just clicked in my head, I called mom. You know, number literally just clicked in my head, it was so crazy. I called mom, the house on fire. She drove so fast back to the crib. I just seen my mom just come, what's going on? House on fire, da, da, da. My mom in there with the baby, with the baby cousin, stuff like that. You know, her nephews. And that shit was just so crazy, bro. And then their mom, she came from McDonald's 'cause they had got food for them. And she came from McDonald's, she seen the house on fire. She dropped the McDonald's to the floor. I just see her trying to run in there to try to save her mom or her sons. It's like, damn, this shit is crazy. Then once it all, like probably 10 minutes go past, I had seen my grandmother and my baby brother walk out. Not walk out, but get carried out in the ambulance thing. I mean, the little walker thing, the little stretcher thing. I just seen, you know, just all of them just covered up in just charcoal. I'm like, damn, like, this is like crazy. But it was such just a, like, a tough thing for me, man. Even to this day, like, it's really been like hard. You know, sometimes I can't speak about it, sometimes I can't. Every time I speak about it, it's so hard. Like, it just still be like flashbacks in the back of my head. It's so hard to get my words out, you know. It be tough, man, but, you know, I never like, like, just to this day, like, that's why I'm so big on, you know, speaking on, you know, God and, you know, having that faith in God. 'Cause that, like, I'm really not supposed to be here. So, you know, I know, you know, my calling is, you know, bringing people back home to Jesus and believing in him and believing that, you know, whatever you're going through, you know, it's always a brighter side. He always can pull you through. So, that's something that, you know, I know it's my calling, but I do that through basketball. - Bro, like, every time I hear that story, like, it just, it touches my heart. Not just because of what you've been through, but how you turn that around, bro. Like, I don't know too many people that would take that and turn it around into what you've turned it around to and become the person through it that you've become. And, like, just giving people back at the crib, like, just hope and people just, how bold you are about your faith, like. - Yeah. - I forget what game it was, and you had the whole hood there, bro. - Yeah, it was the sixth game. - Like, it was all behind you, bro. You, it's like 50, how many people was in the crowd? - Bro, it was a whole world in there. - Bro, and I was like, the fact that this dude, like, overcame what he came. - Five fighters was there too. - That story is like, man, people, that's like a story from a movie, like. - Yeah. - Is it, is that, like, part of the reason you and just your mom and your nephews are so close? - Yeah, bro, like, we just all best friends, bro. We, like, closer than close, bro. Like, I really, my mom is my best friend, bro. But, like, you know, people see me with my little nephew. You know, I call him my baby brother. He's really my cousin, but I call him my nephew, my baby brother, like, he's just everything in one, bro. But I really call him my angel on earth because he survived the house fire. - He has the burn, right? - Yeah, on his face, yeah, on his skin too. He was the one that survived the house fire. My grandmother was covering him, but the other one had passed away. You know, his brother, he passed away, but, you know, by the grace of God, you know, Izzy had survived. He had a big, like, scar on the side of his face, but yeah, he survived, and he was only three weeks old, bro. So, like, can't nobody tell me that, you know, God ain't real at all. Can't nobody tell me that. And I'm just like, damn, like, to this day, he just like me, bro, like, smiling, you know. He gives so many people joy. Like, you would never know what he been through. You would never know what he overcame, you know. And it's like, damn, he just like me, bro. But that's another reason why, like, man, like, we really so close, and when people see it through, you know, the media, or people see it in person, like, yeah, he really doesn't play about them. Like, they all so close. - So, what's, through all of this, like, now, like, through basketball, you just use basketball as, like, a vessel for, to inspire? Is that what you would say? - Yeah, yeah, literally. You know, just to get my story, you know, heard to, just different people across the, just the nation, bro. Like, just trying to reel in people to, you know, Jesus Christ, man, you know, like, it's, we in end times, bro, so I know, you know, it's almost, you know, rallying up, so. - It's almost a wrap. - Yeah, so I'm just trying to use my, you know, my story, you know, with my gift, and just try to, you know, tally in as much people as I can to, you know, home to Christ. So, that's something that I'm really just, you know, taking pride in. - Well, you inspire me, bro, like, 'cause you right, I agree with you that this, the time and the age that we're in, and the fact that nowadays, good is pretty much looked at as bad, and bad is looked at as good. - Good is insane. - Bro, I could get on social media, and the things that people are, like, glorifying as good, are literally evil, and evil is good. And, like, that's what it talks about in the Bible, is end times, so, like, even just talking right now, like, you inspire me to wanna, like, help bring people in, and that's why, like, this podcast to me is important, because, like, I could have a bad basketball game and not feel like doing a podcast, but if people listen to this podcast, and they hear our stories, because we're two people that have been through a lot of adversity, like, I should not, like, for me, in my story, I should not even be in the NBA, either. Like, yeah, I was the number one player in high school, but after the three back surgeries, and now, you know, coming back from that, like, there's guys that are done after one, and there's guys, you know, the brace that I'm wearing, like, no one in the history of NBA has even attempted to play in a brace like that, and I'm trying to hoop, and it's painful, it's hard, like, adversity's hard, but the fact that it inspires someone, like, I feel like our purpose should be to get, like, our story out there to get people to keep going, but like you said, the main thing is bringing people towards Christ, so, like, I think the fact that you shared your story, and people get to know you, like, that's the most important thing. It's hard to keep that perspective, though, like, - Yeah. - It's hard to keep that perspective. - It really is, but, you know, it's something that I just take pride in, bro. Like, I really take pride in just trying to, you know, reel people in, man, just with my story, but, you know, I know this is a podcast where you ask me questions, but I know you've just been through a lot, too, bro, like, just everything that you've been through. You know, even when I was over there in Denver, I had seen you, you know, recovering and stuff, you know, before, you know, you had signed your big deal and stuff like that, I'm like, you know, Mike is in here trying to, you know, get himself going and get back, but, you know, how was that, you know, for you, as far as, like, just trying to, you know, your back injury, but on top of that, still, like, you know, wearing a brace, you know, right before you're about to go to training camp and trying to, like, 'cause you didn't play a season, you know, or you didn't play, like, the whole season, 'cause the season just started, then it happened, you know, and then just trying to get back out there. - Yeah, nobody could tell me that God isn't real, either, but, like, when people ask me for, like, a story on why, I say, like, the contract thing, because, yeah, like, I've hooped in this brace or whatever, like, I've hooped and I've done, like, well, like, obviously, I'm still trying to grow, still trying to get better, still trying to heal my body, but I signed that contract right before I had another injury, like, and you know in the NBA, like, if that injury had come, 'cause I didn't play that whole season right after I signed the contract, and everybody's talking about, "Oh, it's the worst contract in NBA history," you know, people talking crazy, but if I had gotten hurt maybe three weeks prior, then, boom, that big contract, and I think the reason God allowed me to have that contract, and sometimes it's annoying, because sometimes I never even cared to have money like that. - Exactly, I'm so the same way, bro, I just hooped, bro. - I always wanted to hoop, but now, like, once you sign a big contract, people want you to live up to it, and they expect you to be, like, consistent every game, not knowing what you're going through off the court, and not knowing what you're, so that has been kind of hard. People don't know, like, how everything I've gone through, how much-- - And you're still trying to overcome that, too, as well, yeah. - But, like, I think, no one could tell me that God not real, because he allowed me to get that contract, because he knew, for me, you have your gifts, one of my gifts is, like, being generous, so. - Yeah, yeah, facts. - I've been able to use my money, and I'm still trying to think of more ways to use it, like, in a way that God would be happy with. I've been able to help my family, been able to do this, and I never was trying to hold it onto myself, but the hard part is, like, man, people just, it's the people that don't understand. We understand it, bro, and it's just, it's annoying, because they'd be, like, yo, you signed a big contract, you're supposed to do this, that, this, that, and it's, but it's, like, bro, you don't even, like, I didn't even ask for it, but I would've hooped for free. You could've given me a, you didn't got, you didn't even have to give me any millions of dollars, and I still would've hooped. - Still would've hooped, bro, but this is something that they just don't see, and don't understand, bro. You know, they looking from the outside in, and not really looking at, you know, the inside, and really what, you know, we go through on a daily basis, you know, what we're really dealing with, you know, and trying to overcome, still to this day, like, nobody know how painful this, you know, still to this day, how that's feeling, you know, your back, and your foot. They just care about, oh, he need to go out there and perform, he need to da-da-da, which they not even understanding. You going out there, you sacrificing your body, you know, which, you know, some people don't even like to do. They sit out the whole season 'til they right. - 'Til they feeling perfect. - 'Til they feeling perfect, bro. So I'm saying, but, like, I salute you for that, just going out there, and just, you know, trying to sacrifice your body, because I know what you're going through, but, you know, fans that's not paying attention to the game, or not paying attention to you, you know, as a person, they just looking through the TV, oh, he missed all these shots, he da-da-da. But then, when you're making all these shots, they ain't nowhere near to be found, so it's like, what you gonna say now? - Then you the next best, you, it's crazy. - Bro, it's pathetic, bro. That's why, like, I don't get into all that, bro. I just let people just be, oh, bro. I don't care, bro, I could care less, bro. They fans for a reason, bro. - People are so crazy, bro. - That's why they called fans, bro. - And, like, you made the point earlier, like, you could be the best fan in the world. You could literally be, well, I don't really see people talking too crazy about Nicola, 'cause he just, well, he don't even be on social media, but, like, I see people talk crazy about every player. Giannis, Bron, KD, any player can get talked crazy about, so it really is just about, just taking it in stride and dealing with the highs and the lows, like, we, at the end of the day, we're blessed. Like, who cares what this person is in their crib, typing on the phone, like, who really is worried about what they're saying? - I don't get into all that. I'm not gonna lie, all that just be for clickbait, bro. I don't get into all that. I just stay in my lane, bro. They got it. - Right. - They got it, bro. - I think this has been, like, super inspiring. Like, I don't like to keep people on the podcast too long. I just, when I get people on here, I have specific questions that I wanna ask. - Yeah, yeah, for sure. - But I think, for me and you, we bond over the fact that we've both been through adversity and come out the other side. We're really both not supposed to be here, like, after things that we've been through. - Yeah. - And you inspire me to continue to put my message out there. You're very bold with yours, like, on social media. And I feel like that's something that you rarely see now, 'cause people are so worried about being canceled or they come off too strong. You know, the day and age we live in, people are so, like, man, people are out there now, bro. - Oh, it's bad. - If you are one way, like, you can just get, and you've never been someone who cared about this, so I'm the same way. That's why I do this podcast. I wanna say what I feel without, I'm not worried about stepping on anybody's toes, 'cause we never gonna change, like, our opinions. So I appreciate you getting on here and saying what you need to say, bro. - Yeah, I like this podcast, bro. I'm glad you're doing this, man. It's something that, you know, 'cause a lot of people don't even know, like, they just think, oh, we just supposed to just do basketball. It's basketball, basketball, basketball, basketball. That's not how it goes. Because we made it to the league, that's not how it goes. - Shut up and dribble, nigga. You know what the comment said? Like, shut up and dribble. - I want you to say nothing. - Me and AG put the parlay clip on there, put the parlay clip about, like, man. I asked him, like, bro, do you ever trip about the comments of people talking about the parlay and people talking about, oh, you messed up their parlay and you lost them money? And we put that on Instagram, and I'm expecting people to be like, man, like, people shouldn't be on that, whatever. I seen the comment, shut up and dribble, nigga. I was like, yo, are you kidding me? - Bro, they ruthless, bro, they don't care, bro. They really don't care. - But I just think we both are just, just literally just play basketball. Like, we have voices, too. Like, we have things that, other than basketball, that we're into, you know. For you, it's podcasts. For me, you know, it's making music and stuff like that. Just trying to just, you know, let people hear my message through my music. But, you know, that's something that, you know, I salute you on, too, man, just starting a podcast and just getting people on here and, like, you know, letting them, you know, you're using your platform to, you know, help me get my story out there. That's something that I appreciate, too, bro. Thank you for having me, for sure. - For real, bro, now, real quick, 'cause I did want to touch on the music real quick before you dip. So, you hoop, but you also do the music on the side. Is that something, like, therapeutic to you? Are you trying to get a message out there? What is the whole music thing about? 'Cause you're actually nice. - Yeah. (laughs) - Remember I was singing a song, though? - Yeah. (laughs) - Yeah, bro, so what's the whole music about? - Oh, man, so, like, you know, back, you know, in 2018, you know, with the tragedy thing that I was telling you about, you know, what happened to me, you know, my family. I was on, like, a house arrest, like, bed rest, basically. Like, I couldn't, like, leave the house, you know, I was recovering, you know, with my patella tendon. I was down for, like, six, seven months, bro. And I really couldn't do nothing, but I was in a crib with all my boys and shit, so I was just chilling. But I always had, like, a voice where I can, like, you know, sing and, like, harmonize beats and stuff like that. And so, I'm like, man, maybe I can give it a shot. But, like, my homeboys, they could, like, they really know how to rap. So, I'm like, all right, let me try this hook thing. I'ma just make the hook, and y'all make the verses, and we gon' see where we go from there. So, you know, I just start writing hooks down, and it just went from there, and a lot of people like, man, like, this John Hart. Like, we rockin' with this, y'all was flowin', bro. But this was, like, 2018, 2019. We started doing shows, bro. Like, getting paid for shows. (laughs) - Like, back at the crib? - Yes, bro, we was going around the whole Wilmington, bro, getting paid for shows, bro. We was turning it up, bro. Like, yes, bro, we was having a ball. I'm in there with the brace on, with the crutches performing. (laughs) - Bro, I was going, I ain't gonna lie, I had a lot of fun. Even though, like, that was a very low moment of my life, like, I really had a lot of fun, though. Like, 2018, 2019. But that really got me into the music, though, bro. Then I dropped a single, and it went crazy. - Which one is that again? - It's called, "We Gon' Shine." - What's the one I was singing that one, though? - It might be, it might be, is it the new one? - Nah, it's the older one, I think. I gotta look it up. But where do you wanna take the music? You wanna, like, actually, like, this is, like, a real thing you do? - Yeah, 'cause, like, the message that I put in my songs, bro, they're so inspiring to other people, like, you know, what they're going through. And they can relate to me through my music. So it's like, damn, like, I feel what he's saying. You know, just the background, how I came up and stuff. You know, what I've been through in my life. You know, just putting that all in a song. They like, yeah, like, that's something I can listen to. You know, 'cause I really don't sound like, you know, I sound like a real rapper, bro. And they like, yeah. (laughs) Like, damn, this music is really gold, bro. So I'm like, damn, I'm gonna just keep putting music out. I haven't dropped an album for, like, a year. They was on my ass about dropping an album. - And then you put the thing on the 'Gram, the little clip, and people was going crazy. - Yes, bro, the little Discard video that I had dropped. But, yeah, they were going crazy over the music, bro. They love it, bro. So I'm gonna definitely just keep going with it. I feel like it's gonna be great worldwide. I can't wait 'til so many more people hear my music, bro. - Especially when you get back and you're killing on the court like you're going to very soon. - Facts. - And then you're doing the music on top. Bro, keep sharing your message. Like, even though your story is so painful, like, that is an inspiring story, bro. And it's a testimony to God. Like, God says, like, your testimony will bring, people's testimony will bring other people to him. So that is, you know, you can really do that, bro. But I appreciate you for being you, dog. I appreciate you. I know you was scared to hop on the podcast. - Yeah, I was scared. - I hope I didn't ask you too many crazy questions, bro. - No, it was perfect, bro. It was perfect, man. I had a dope time here, bro. So I thank you for that, bro, for sure. - Curious Mike out. ♪ The name's FPJ ♪ - Yes, sir. (hip hop music) Yes, sir. - My God, dog. It's a great job, dog. Fact. - Bro, I appreciate you, bro. - Yeah, for sure, man. You my guy. I ain't gonna lie. I really don't be doing the podcast. - I know, 'cause it's-- - But it just always blow up, bro. - I know, bro. - And you know, everybody does everything for clickbait, bro. - Everything. You know, I'm not finna put, "Oh, Bones Highlands talks about--" - Yeah, that's it. - About, you know, like-- - Oh my God, bro. - I really wanted to get you on here. The main thing was, like, your story, bro, 'cause I know it's not something you really talk about a lot, but it is, like, bro. You can change people's lives with your story, bro. - I feel like once a lot of people, like, were over here, they gonna be like, "Damn." Like, a lot of people, to this day, like, "Damn, that shit's fucking crazy." Like, what really made it, like, viral when we played in Philly, bro, and all the people came, and you know, I had explained my story, but I had dropped, you know, tears, you know, in the press conference. You know, I couldn't hold it in, bro. I just dropped tears, bro, and that really, like, blew up, man. A lot of people had caught up to my story, and like, "Damn, this kid is, like, inspiring." Like, it's no way he's still going. He's still smiling. He's just this joyful kid and shit like that. - I can't believe that, bro. Like, you literally just-- - Yeah. - You literally just was in your room chilling, and then you look out the door, and the flames were just going crazy. - Watch, man. I've never seen nothing like it in my life, bro. Just imagine you open a door, bro, and it's like, are you seeing this orange, blue, and, like, red? - Isn't that the craziest thing? - That was really, like, some movie shit. I watch movies, bro. It's like, they got all the time in the world, bro, to, like, just do all this fucking thinking, and it's like, you don't have that time, bro. I probably was in that room for, like, three minutes, bro. - And then you just was ready to give up and just-- - Yeah, bro, I was gonna go, bro. I'm not gonna lie. - I can't believe that, bro. - I was gonna go. Like, the whole room was just cloudy and just full of, like, black smoke just coming in. I'm like, "Nah." But, you know, God's voice is so powerful, bro. - Bro, you heard it. You heard it. - Yes, bro. I swear, I was sitting there on my knees, bro, just ready just to go, bro. I just was like, "Damn, like, all right. "If it's my time, it's my time." Like, you know, I feel like, you know, when God gives his time to people, it's like, you know, he's calling them home. So I'm like, "All right, it is what it is. "Like, I'm just gonna go." But, bro, his voice so powerful, bro. I just heard it in my head, bro. Just get up. I got you. Like, just get up. - And then the reason your little nephew survived was because your grandma-- - My grandma was-- - Hovering over him. - Hovered over him. - Yeah. - And she's burnt, charcoal, and then he survived. - Yep, mm-hmm, right over top, bro. - I can't believe, you said he was three weeks old. - He was three weeks, yeah. - I just can't believe, like, the smoke inhalation. - That's the grace of God. That was so crazy. Like, literally went to the hospital that night. Like, my grandma, she didn't, like, say she passed away yet. I think it, like, got to her, like, almost the next day, like, the middle of the night, and said she passed. But, like, I just kept hearing my, like, my nephew, he's, like, he has a chance to make it. Like, he's alive. Like, I'm like, "Wow, this is fucking crazy, bro." Like, but they sent up my other baby cousin that passed, but we literally had one more, just, like, just here. That's just the grace of God, bro. Like, it's just crazy. - Wait, who ran in? Was it the ambulance that ran in there and got them, or who was it? - Yeah, yeah, the ambulance ran in there and got them. But it, like, I live, like, literally down the street from the fire station. They took so long to get there. I'm like, bro, like, I swear to God, I can walk down there. Like, I'm like, bro, it's literally two blocks away. I don't understand what the fuck is taking so long, but they took forever to get there. But yeah, when they had walked out and walked them out and on a little stretcher thing, man, that shit was, like, really scary to see, dawg.
