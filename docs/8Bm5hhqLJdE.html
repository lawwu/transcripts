But a question that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bm5hhqLJdE&t=34" target="_blank">00:00:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">has really been bothering me and is on my heart is this, would God still have died for me even</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bm5hhqLJdE&t=40" target="_blank">00:00:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">if it didn't, hypothetically speaking, bring him any glory?" Let me give a couple reasons why</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bm5hhqLJdE&t=48" target="_blank">00:00:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">if Amber thinks deeply about this question, I don't think she will want to ask it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bm5hhqLJdE&t=56" target="_blank">00:00:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think she would even want to contemplate this possibility if she could. So here's the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bm5hhqLJdE&t=64" target="_blank">00:01:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">reasons I say that. There's two of them. Number one, I doubt that anything good can come from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bm5hhqLJdE&t=74" target="_blank">00:01:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">trying to hypothesize about possibilities in the New Testament that do not exist and cannot exist.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bm5hhqLJdE&t=85" target="_blank">00:01:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">This is especially true of hypotheses that require God to be viewed in a way that doesn't exist,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bm5hhqLJdE&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">a way that the New Testament excludes. It would be like breaking the first commandment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bm5hhqLJdE&t=100" target="_blank">00:01:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">to have no other gods before you. We would be trying to imagine a world in which we have created</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bm5hhqLJdE&t=108" target="_blank">00:01:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">an idol, that is, a God who's not the true God. So my first reason for saying I doubt that Amber</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bm5hhqLJdE&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">wants to pursue this question is that no good is going to come from the mental effort to create a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bm5hhqLJdE&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">world in which your mind is dominated by an idol. Number two, this is more important, I think.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bm5hhqLJdE&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">The main reason I think that she would not want to pursue this question if she thought more deeply</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bm5hhqLJdE&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">about it is that her underlying assumption is probably mistaken. Now, I can't be sure, of course,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bm5hhqLJdE&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">of what her underlying assumption is, but let me venture. She can test it. It sounds like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bm5hhqLJdE&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">she wants to be loved by God—who doesn't?—and feels that this love from God is somehow compromised</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bm5hhqLJdE&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.560</a></span> | <span class="t">or lessened by the fact that in loving her, he's exalting or magnifying or displaying his own glory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bm5hhqLJdE&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that's the bottom line issue for Amber. So I think she's asking something like this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bm5hhqLJdE&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Would God still want me, value me, or bless me, even if his glory was not exalted or magnified</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bm5hhqLJdE&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">or displayed in that kind of love? But right here, it is so crucial that we penetrate to the bottom</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bm5hhqLJdE&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">of what God's love for Amber and me really is. Amber seems to feel that the essence of God's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bm5hhqLJdE&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">love for her will be experienced when she feels wanted by God for who she is. Would he want me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bm5hhqLJdE&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">even if his glory were not magnified in wanting me? Now, think about that. What does wanting me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bm5hhqLJdE&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">mean? Does it mean he wants me in order to use me like a slave to run his errands?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bm5hhqLJdE&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Does wanting me mean because he sees in me so much beauty that it enriches him to have me?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bm5hhqLJdE&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Does it mean it gives him pleasure to bless me and make me happy? Now, I think the answer to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bm5hhqLJdE&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that third question—the first two is no, and I think the answer to that third question is yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bm5hhqLJdE&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">God delights for us to be happy. He wants us. He wants us. He calls us a treasure. He wants us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bm5hhqLJdE&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">not to use us to meet his needs—he doesn't have any—but to make us glad as he meets our needs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bm5hhqLJdE&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And what are our deepest needs? What would make Amber and John Piper truly happy?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bm5hhqLJdE&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">God knows what the answer is, and he made us this way. What will make us most happy is being with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bm5hhqLJdE&t=328" target="_blank">00:05:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">God, seeing God, the glory of God, enjoying God. But this means that all the greatness and all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bm5hhqLJdE&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">goodness and all the truth and justice and wisdom and beauty, glory of God must be preserved and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bm5hhqLJdE&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">magnified in saving us precisely so that in having us for himself, he might be able to satisfy us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bm5hhqLJdE&t=357" target="_blank">00:05:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">with himself. So I don't think Amber wants to even contemplate a universe, a world,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bm5hhqLJdE&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">in which there is a different kind of God than this.

There is no better</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bm5hhqLJdE&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">love for us than the way God really loves us.
