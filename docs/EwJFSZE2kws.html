It was very far ahead of where we were at the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwJFSZE2kws&t=40" target="_blank">00:00:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And I don't know, I didn't really have the financial sophistication to really even engage</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwJFSZE2kws&t=47" target="_blank">00:00:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">with that kind of debate. I think I sort of deep down believed in what we were doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwJFSZE2kws&t=53" target="_blank">00:00:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And I did some analysis. I was like, "Okay, well, what would I go do if I wasn't doing this?" It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwJFSZE2kws&t=61" target="_blank">00:01:01.520</a></span> | <span class="t">like, "Well, I really like building things, and I like helping people communicate, and I like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwJFSZE2kws&t=65" target="_blank">00:01:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">understanding what's going on with people and the dynamics between people. So I think if I sold this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwJFSZE2kws&t=71" target="_blank">00:01:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">company, I'd just go build another company like this." And I kind of like the one I have. So I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwJFSZE2kws&t=77" target="_blank">00:01:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">mean, why? But I don't know. I think a lot of the biggest bets that people make are often just based</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwJFSZE2kws&t=87" target="_blank">00:01:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">on conviction and values. It's actually usually very hard to do the analyses trying to connect</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwJFSZE2kws&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the dots forward. You didn't sell the company for a billion dollars, and like the metaverse,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwJFSZE2kws&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">you knew we were going to do this even though the market was hammering you for it. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwJFSZE2kws&t=102" target="_blank">00:01:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm actually curious, what is the source of that edge? And you said, "Oh, values, I have this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwJFSZE2kws&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">intuition." But everybody says that, right? If you had to say something that's specific to you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwJFSZE2kws&t=111" target="_blank">00:01:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">how would you express what that is? Why were you so convinced about the metaverse?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwJFSZE2kws&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I think that those are different questions. So what are the things that kind of power me?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwJFSZE2kws&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I think we've talked about a bunch of things. I just really like building things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwJFSZE2kws&t=129" target="_blank">00:02:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I specifically like building things around how people communicate and sort of understanding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwJFSZE2kws&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">how people express themselves and how people work.

I think a lot of other people in the industry studied computer science.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwJFSZE2kws&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">It's always been sort of the intersection of those two things for me. But I think it's also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwJFSZE2kws&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of this really deep drive. I don't know how to explain it, but I just feel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwJFSZE2kws&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">constitutionally like I'm doing something wrong if I'm not building something new.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwJFSZE2kws&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Even when we're putting together the business case for investing $100 billion in AI or some huge</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwJFSZE2kws&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">amount in the metaverse, it's like, yeah, I mean, we have plans that I think make it pretty clear</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwJFSZE2kws&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">that if our stuff works, it'll be a good investment. But you can't know for certain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwJFSZE2kws&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">from the outset. There's all these arguments that people have, whether it's with advisors or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwJFSZE2kws&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">different folks. It's like, well, how are you confident enough to do this? And it's like, well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwJFSZE2kws&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the day I stop trying to build new things, I'm just done.
