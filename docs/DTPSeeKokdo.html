opposite sense, that rather than an example of creative destruction, which would be a mitzvah of entrepreneurship, we have an act of destruction, destruction.</span></div><div class="c"><span

standpoint, to describe Doge as an ideological purge of progressivism, performing an act of, or performing the job of efficiency, rather than a department of actual efficiency itself.</span></div><div

influential voices representing the left wing of American politics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.300</a></span> | <span class="t">He is a columnist for the New York Times, author of Why We're Polarized, and host of the Ezra Klein Show.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Derek is a writer at The Atlantic, author of Hitmakers and On Work, and host of the Plain English Podcast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Together, they've written a new book, simply titled Abundance, that lays out a kind of manifesto for the left.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.820</a></span> | <span class="t">It is already a controversial, widely debated book, but I think it puts forward a powerful vision for what the Democratic Party could stand for in the coming election.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.420</a></span> | <span class="t">If I may, let me comment on the fact that sometimes in this podcast, I delve into the dark realm of politics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Indeed, politics often divides us, and frankly, brings out the worst in some very smart people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Plus, to me, it is frustrating how much of the political discourse is drama, and how little of it is rigorous, empathetic discussion of policy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I hate this, but I guess I understand why.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.340</a></span> | <span class="t">If the other side is called either Hitler or Stalin, unlined by swarms of chanting mobs, it's hard to carry out a nuanced discussion about immigration, healthcare, housing, education, foreign policy, and so on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.960</a></span> | <span class="t">On top of that, anytime I talk about politics, half the audience is pissed off at me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And no, there is no audience capture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I get shit on equally by different groups across the political spectrum, depending on the guest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Why, I don't know, but I'm slowly coming to accept that this is the way of the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.900</a></span> | <span class="t">I try to maintain my cool, return hate with compassion, and learn from the criticism and the general madness of it all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Still, I think it's valuable to sometimes talk about politics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.440</a></span> | <span class="t">It's an important part to the big picture of human civilization, but indeed, it is only still a small part.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.400</a></span> | <span class="t">My happy place is talking to scientists, engineers, programmers, video game designers, historians, philosophers, musicians, athletes, filmmakers, and so on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I apologize for the occasional detour into politics, especially over the past few months.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=333" target="_blank">00:05:33.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I did a few conversations with world leaders, and I have a few more coming up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=338" target="_blank">00:05:38.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So, there will be a few more political podcasts coming out, in part so I can be better prepared to deeply understand the mind, the life, and the perspective of each world leader.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I hope you come along with me on this journey into the darkness of politics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.460</a></span> | <span class="t">As I try to shine a light on the complex human mess of it all, hoping to understand us humans better,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.200</a></span> | <span class="t">always backed, of course, by deep, rigorous research and by empathy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=364" target="_blank">00:06:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Long-term, I hope for political discussions to be only a small percentage of this

don't deserve all of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=456" target="_blank">00:07:36.820</a></span> | <span class="t">We got

<span class="t">But at a very fundamental level, that we are sitting here is unfair.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=466" target="_blank">00:07:46.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And that so many other people are in conditions that are much worse, much more precarious, much more exploited is unfair.</span></div><div

not necessarily be to turn that unfairness into perfect equality, but to rectify that unfairness into a kind of universal dignity, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=490" target="_blank">00:08:10.760</a></span> | <span class="t">The left is fundamentally more skeptical of capitalism and particularly unchecked forms of capitalism than the right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=496" target="_blank">00:08:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I always think this is hard to talk about because what we call unchecked capitalism is nevertheless very much supported by government.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=502" target="_blank">00:08:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think in a way, markets are things that are enforced by government, whether they are how you set the rules of them is what ends up differing between the left and the right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=512" target="_blank">00:08:32.580</a></span> | <span class="t">But the left tends to be more worried about the fact that you could get rich building coal-fired power plants, belching pollution into the air, and you could get rich laying down solar panels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=524" target="_blank">00:08:44.980</a></span> |

target="_blank">00:08:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there's a set of goals about regulating the unchecked potential of capitalism that also relates to sort of exploitation of workers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=537" target="_blank">00:08:57.740</a></span> | <span class="t">There's very fundamental questions about how much people get paid, how much power they have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=543" target="_blank">00:09:03.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, the rectification of economic and other forms of power is very fundamental to the left.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=548" target="_blank">00:09:08.760</a></span> | <span class="t">When you think about what the minimum wage is, I am a successful podcast

the New York Times, I have a certain amount of market power in that negotiation because other firms want to hire me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=560" target="_blank">00:09:20.360</a></span> | <span class="t">When you are a minimum wage worker, the reason we have a minimum wage is in part to rectify a power problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=567" target="_blank">00:09:27.740</a></span> | <span class="t">A lot of workers do not have market power.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=569" target="_blank">00:09:29.940</a></span> | <span class="t">They do not have a bunch of job opportunities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=572" target="_blank">00:09:32.000</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=579" target="_blank">00:09:39.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So trying to rectify power imbalances is, I think, another thing folks on the left take more seriously.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=584" target="_blank">00:09:44.440</a></span> | <span class="t">That would be a start of things that I think broadly unite the, maybe let's call it the intuitions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=590"

environment, the luck of the draw, the things that happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=615"

some role or a lot of role for government to help you when that unfairness strikes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=629"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=636" target="_blank">00:10:36.420</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the left is more comfortable with a larger government as long as it's effective and efficient, at least in this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=642" target="_blank">00:10:42.620</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:10:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">It was Republicans who acquiesced to that larger government in the 1950s.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=653" target="_blank">00:10:53.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And then starting in the 1970s, 1980s, it's typically been conservatives who've tried to constrict governments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=659" target="_blank">00:10:59.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes

fear cultural radicalism or the destruction of society.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=694" target="_blank">00:11:34.780</a></span> |

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=700" target="_blank">00:11:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And at the level of government, that can mean change in terms of creating new programs that don't previously exist.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=705" target="_blank">00:11:45.780</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=711" target="_blank">00:11:51.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Just in the last few years, it was Biden who tried to add a bunch of programs, whether it was infrastructure, the Chips and Science Act, the IRA, and then Trump comes into office and is unwinding it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=721" target="_blank">00:12:01.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I also think they tolerate different things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=724" target="_blank">00:12:04.420</a></span> | <span class="t">I think liberals are more likely to tolerate a little bit of overreach, a little bit of radicalism in terms of trying to push society into a world where it hasn't been.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=733" target="_blank">00:12:13.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I think conservatives are more likely to tolerate injustice.</span></div><div

inequality in the nature of the world, and we're not going to try to overcorrect for it with our policies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=745" target="_blank">00:12:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I think that even at a layer above what Ezra was articulating with the policy differences between liberals and conservatives, there's almost like an archetypal difference between what they fear and value and tolerate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=762" target="_blank">00:12:42.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Liberals fearing injustice, seeking change, tolerating sometimes a bit of what people might think of as overreach, while conservatives fear that overreach, value tradition, and often tolerate injustice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=774" target="_blank">00:12:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">The only thing I would say is that I do think this sort of the left likes big government, the right likes small government oversimplifies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=781" target="_blank">00:13:01.880</a></span> | <span class="t">The left is pretty comfortable with an expansive government that is trying to correct for some of the imbalances of power and injustices and imbalances of luck I talked about earlier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=792" target="_blank">00:13:12.660</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=806" target="_blank">00:13:26.580</a></span> | <span class="t">But the right's view that on the one hand the government is incompetent, and on the other hand we could send our army across oceans, invade Afghanistan and Iraq, and then rebuild these societies we don't understand into fully functioning liberal democracies that will be our allies, was an extraordinary level of trust in a very big government.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=827" target="_blank">00:13:47.220</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, that was expensive, that took manpower, that was compared to, we're going to set up, you know, the Affordable Care Act in America, that took a lot more faith in the U.S. government being able to do something that was extraordinarily difficult.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=840" target="_blank">00:14:00.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But the left has more confidence in the government of the check, and the right has more confidence in the government of the gun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=846" target="_blank">00:14:06.200</a></span> | <span

primary,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=1325" target="_blank">00:22:05.900</a></span> | <span class="t">there was still time for

2020 amidst just a very different political equilibrium, a sense that you had a transitionary moment between two versions of the Democratic Party.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=1366" target="_blank">00:22:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe Joe Biden reaching a little bit back to the past, to these sort of lunch pail,

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=1379" target="_blank">00:22:59.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you have this sort of weird set of historical factors like operating at the

target="_blank">00:23:10.120</a></span> | <span class="t">There is Biden as Obama's vice president, who nevertheless did not run in the election after Obama.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=1397" target="_blank">00:23:17.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I think a lot of people look back at 2016 and think, you know what, if Biden had been the candidate, he would have beaten Trump and we would live in a different reality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=1404" target="_blank">00:23:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And then Biden chose Harris as an effort to shore up his own at least assumed weaknesses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=1411" target="_blank">00:23:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. He's a white man in the Democratic Party at a time when the Democratic Party is diversifying.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=1416" target="_blank">00:23:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And when the view of how you win elections is you put is you put back together the Obama coalition and the Obama coalition is young people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=1424" target="_blank">00:23:44.140</a></span> | <span class="t">It's, you know, voters of color and it's enough working class white voters and then college educated white voters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=1431" target="_blank">00:23:51.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. That's the Obama coalition.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=1432" target="_blank">00:23:52.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And so Biden picks Harris, you know, for different reasons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=1436" target="_blank">00:23:56.700</a></span> | <span class="t">My view at that time was I was sort of a Tammy Duckworth person and thought I should have picked Tammy Duckworth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=1440" target="_blank">00:24:00.860</a></span> | <span class="t">But but there are different people out there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=1444" target="_blank">00:24:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the kind of moment that Harris was running in just sort of dissipates.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=1448" target="_blank">00:24:08.840</a></span> | <span class="t">First, she has a particular background from California where she's a tough on crime.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=1454" target="_blank">00:24:14.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Her book is called Smart on Crime Prosecutor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=1456" target="_blank">00:24:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But she runs in the Democratic Party at a time when it's turned on that kind of politics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=1461" target="_blank">00:24:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">People want a lot from her personally, but they don't want a sort of prosecutorial character.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=1469" target="_blank">00:24:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So she sort of abandons that and never, I think, really finds another political identity, certainly before she begins running, you know, in 2024 that works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=1476" target="_blank">00:24:36.760</a></span> | <span class="t">But she's a talented

performer on the stump.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=1480" target="_blank">00:24:40.900</a></span> | <span class="t">But she doesn't really have a theory of politics and policy that she's identified with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=1486" target="_blank">00:24:46.060</a></span> | <span class="t">But she's a way for Biden to signal that he understands that him being, you know, in 2020, a 78-year-old white guy, he understands the future is not him or at least not just him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=1495" target="_blank">00:24:55.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And he's sort of trying to make a coalitional pick that speaks to his own, you know, potential weaknesses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=1502" target="_blank">00:25:02.300</a></span> | <span class="t">I think by 2024, you have two problems, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span

had been running in a primary for, you know, a year and a half, having to fend off Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg and whomever else, she either would have figured out how to do it, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=1552" target="_blank">00:25:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Primaries are periods of

target="_blank">00:25:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">But she doesn't get any of that, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

won.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=1565" target="_blank">00:26:05.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Whether you think Biden's

Party that is making some of its leaders perform this sort of coalitional calculation when they're communicating, such that it makes them less interested in appearing in settings that might cost them, that might not benefit them in exactly the sort of pre-calculated way they have to get their message across.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

that goes well, if you talk to Wes Moore, let's say, and there is a five-minute segment where he articulates some vision of liberalism in the 2020s that everyone says,</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=2885" target="_blank">00:48:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And in fact, the risk valence entirely switches.</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=2904" target="_blank">00:48:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">The person who throws the first stone in a riot has to be very

reality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=3286" target="_blank">00:54:46.380</a></span> | <span class="t">I think one thing you're

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=3299" target="_blank">00:54:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">The last chapter of the book, we talk about an idea that is picked up from a historian named Gary Garstle, which is an idea of political orders.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=3307" target="_blank">00:55:07.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And political orders are periods that have a sort of structure of consensus and a structure of a zone of conflict.</span></div><div

if only tacitly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=3320" target="_blank">00:55:20.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So you have a New Deal order.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=3322" target="_blank">00:55:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">New Deal order is founded by FDR.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=3325" target="_blank">00:55:25.480</a></span> | <span class="t">It is entrenched when Dwight

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=3335" target="_blank">00:55:35.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So those are sort of right there, the three ingredients typically of an order.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=3339" target="_blank">00:55:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You have a party that starts it, an opposition party that accepts key premises, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=3345" target="_blank">00:55:45.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Dwight Eisenhower doesn't come in and say, we're going to roll back the whole New Deal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=3348" target="_blank">00:55:48.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's often held in place by an external antagonist, in that case, the Soviet Union.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=3352" target="_blank">00:55:52.820</a></span> | <span class="t">You have then, you have in the 70s, stagflation, the Vietnam War, a series of problems that the New Deal order no longer seems able to handle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=3360" target="_blank">00:56:00.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So you have the rise of what he calls the neoliberal order.</span></div><div

target="_blank">00:56:11.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And it really is entrenched by Bill Clinton.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=3373" target="_blank">00:56:13.880</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, the era of big government is over.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=3376" target="_blank">00:56:16.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And partially, it's entrenched also by the fall of the Soviet Union, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=3380" target="_blank">00:56:20.200</a></span> | <span class="t">The fall of the Soviet Union is like this proof point that the sort of capitalists were right, that markets are the way of the future.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

assumptions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=3394" target="_blank">00:56:34.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there are arguments about what the markets should be doing, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=3396" target="_blank">00:56:36.740</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, Obamacare is about creating sort of markets and health insurance, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=3399" target="_blank">00:56:39.660</a></span> | <span class="t">You can use markets for very progressive ends.</span></div><div class="c"><span

crisis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=3420" target="_blank">00:57:00.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And it botches, in many ways, the answer to the financial crisis, puts too little demand in the economy, lets a sort of recession linger and a very slow recovery linger for too long.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

redistribution, I really think this is an important point because there's a great new paper by David Schleicher,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=4493" target="_blank">01:14:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and I'm so sorry because I'm forgetting his co-author, their law

victory of gentry law, we used to have a law that was very dynamic when it came to property and land.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=4503" target="_blank">01:15:03.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It was very different than how things were in Britain.</span></div><div

century, we moved American law to be much more for what they call the gentry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=4511"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=4515" target="_blank">01:15:15.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And we do that through a million things, covenants and HOAs and all these sort of contracts who make people enter into so they can't even build on their own land.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=4522" target="_blank">01:15:22.700</a></span> | <span class="t">But one of the things that just happens when you constrict the supply of housing is that people who got in when the getting was good, you know, I mean, it's a classic story in New York and L.A. and in SF.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=4533" target="_blank">01:15:33.580</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, you bought a place in 1977 for $220,000, and now it's worth $2.7 million, and maybe you'll pass it on to your kids or you'll sell it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=4543" target="_blank">01:15:43.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But the working-class families

right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=4654" target="_blank">01:17:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">It covered much more than

aggressive redistribution.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=4691" target="_blank">01:18:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, there

often what we want to do, to do more redistribution, if you're redistributing some kind of thing that gives you access to a good or a service, you need to expand the good or the

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=6849" target="_blank">01:54:09.720</a></span> | <span class="t">But one reason we've selected for so many lawyers, and America has a lot of lawyers, is we became a society that needs a lot of lawyers, because we are a society that is stable, affluent, and have become, like, very into bargaining.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=6860" target="_blank">01:54:20.140</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, Donald Trump is a real estate developer.</span></div><div

the reason you don't have all that many huge firms building housing in many, many states simultaneously, is it requires a lot of relationships in the individual city you're in.</span></div><div

great biography of Donald Trump, Confidence Man, which focuses a lot on his time as a real estate magnate in New York, you see, like, Donald Trump doesn't build a ton of stuff in other states.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=6887" target="_blank">01:54:47.560</a></span> | <span class="t">He actually builds in other

construction and creation something that is the output of negotiations, rather than, like, very clear standards and rules where if you've done it, you can just do it, you get a lot of lawyers, you get a lot of management consultants, you get a lot of finance people, because that's what society is selecting for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=6917" target="_blank">01:55:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what you've made it possible to have agency and freedom in.</span></div><div

things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=6922" target="_blank">01:55:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">This is coming from Nick Bagley, who's a University of Michigan law professor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=6927" target="_blank">01:55:27.020</a></span> | <span class="t">But between Walter Mondale and Tim Walls, there's not a single person on a Democratic presidential ticket who didn't go to law school, not one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=6936" target="_blank">01:55:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, the Democratic Party in particular is a party of lawyers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=6938" target="_blank">01:55:38.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And lawyers look at things from the legal perspective.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=6941" target="_blank">01:55:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And the legal perspective is that government is legitimate by following process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=6945" target="_blank">01:55:45.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And Bagley's point is that government attains legitimacy, at least in part, through outcomes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=6952" target="_blank">01:55:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And when you prize process so high over outcomes, you think you're acting legitimately, but actually it would have made you legitimate in the view of the people, is that you built the thing you told them you were going to build.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=6961" target="_blank">01:56:01.460</a></span> | <span class="t">You made it possible to live affordably in the city.</span></div><div

populist strongmen who say, I alone can fix it, because they've kind of given up on this procedural liberalism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=6971" target="_blank">01:56:11.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, they didn't deliver for them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=6972" target="_blank">01:56:12.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So you keep telling them, you know, we're the ones who know how to run government, and they don't see it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=6976" target="_blank">01:56:16.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And eventually somebody else comes and says, I'm going to bust through the walls of this thing like the Kool-Aid man, and they win.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

believe, like as Derek said a minute ago, this has become non democratically responsive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=7385" target="_blank">02:03:05.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Like and the way it becomes democratically responsive is deeply responsive to the president.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=7390" target="_blank">02:03:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">The president represents a different politics than Joe Biden's

criticisms I have for Donald Trump and and the Trump administration is there's a natural circles of sycophancy that forms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=7432" target="_blank">02:03:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, every president has their personality and psychological

that I think is important to say about Trump is that the difference between Trump and, say, Biden or Trump and Obama is not that Trump will negotiate with Putin and Obama wouldn't.</span></div><div

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=9307" target="_blank">02:35:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, I am very much on the view of you talk to everybody.</span></div><div

that, like, it was clear that the Biden administration needed to be pushing for negotiations over Ukraine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=9318" target="_blank">02:35:18.120</a></span> | <span class="t">There was not going to be some endgame here where Ukraine got all of its territory back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=9323" target="_blank">02:35:23.500</a></span> | <span class="t">But, but, but, but, I don't think it is reasonable to look at what he is doing and say that is the norm that he has broken.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=9333" target="_blank">02:35:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">The idea that we should have negotiations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=9335" target="_blank">02:35:35.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, many different presidents have done many surprising things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=9338" target="_blank">02:35:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And he's rolled back a bunch of those things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=9340" target="_blank">02:35:40.260</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, Republicans have been very unfriendly to the opening that began with Cuba.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=9345" target="_blank">02:35:45.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. And that was like a big deal in American foreign policy, something Obama did against very heavy criticism, something that cost him and cost Democrats in Florida and among Cuban voters in the following election.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=9356" target="_blank">02:35:56.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So when I, I just don't think that that's that unusual thing with Trump.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=9359" target="_blank">02:35:59.740</a></span> | <span class="t">I also just want to say with the tariffs, you sort of wanted to cut the tariffs off from Doge and cut the tariffs off from this broader agenda.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=9365" target="_blank">02:36:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And one reason I don't is that I think the way to understand tariffs, look, you can be accomplishing many different things with tariffs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=9373" target="_blank">02:36:13.220</a></span> | <span class="t">One thing, which was a theory that, that you heard from some people around Trump and, and, and sort of fit what he said on the campaign trail, which was Trump's position on the campaign trail was that he was going to lay down 10 to 20% tariffs on all imported goods and 65% tariffs on imported goods from China.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=9389" target="_blank">02:36:29.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think that's a bad idea for a bunch of different reasons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=9392" target="_blank">02:36:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But what that is, is a stable change in the cost structure for all corporations and all trade.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=9398" target="_blank">02:36:38.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And then different players can make different investment decisions in the longterm based on this new cost structure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=9403" target="_blank">02:36:43.380</a></span> | <span class="t">What he's doing is, as Derek said, and I've had these funny experiences where I'm literally doing a podcast with a tariffs expert and I'll be talking about like the auto parts problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=9414" target="_blank">02:36:54.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And then my producer would be like, uh, he just, you know, delayed the tariff on the auto parts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=9420" target="_blank">02:37:00.160</a></span> | <span class="t">What he's doing with these tariffs that you move on and you move off and you negotiate over endlessly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=9425" target="_blank">02:37:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I've been told this again, by people around him is their view is that America had leverage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=9431" target="_blank">02:37:11.120</a></span> | <span class="t">It wasn't using and tariffs in particular are a form of executive control.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=9435" target="_blank">02:37:15.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Trade deals need to be negotiated and ratified with Congress.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=9439" target="_blank">02:37:19.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Trade deals are, are, are something you have to do with the rest of the system, but tariffs are something Trump can do unilaterally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=9445" target="_blank">02:37:25.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And one thing Trump wants is control.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=9446" target="_blank">02:37:26.660</a></span> | <span class="t">That is the through line of virtually everything in his politics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=9450" target="_blank">02:37:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Tariffs are a leverage based form of foreign policy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=9453" target="_blank">02:37:33.060</a></span> | <span class="t">They are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=9453" target="_blank">02:37:33.880</a></span> | <span class="t">America has the biggest economy in the world that anybody who's going to get into a trade war with us is going to suffer worse than we will.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=9461" target="_blank">02:37:41.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's something where the president can use the tariffs because of authority granted by Congress some time ago for other purposes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=9467" target="_blank">02:37:47.640</a></span> | <span class="t">He can use them with a huge amount of discretion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=9470" target="_blank">02:37:50.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can use them on the one hand to say, well, I think that we've lost too much manufacturing and the dollar is undervalued in other places.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=9476" target="_blank">02:37:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we want to use tariffs to make the cost structure differently so that people to locate more of the supply chains and the intermediate manufacturing in the United States.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=9486" target="_blank">02:38:06.580</a></span> | <span class="t">But you can also use a tariff to say Columbia has to take the people we're deporting and they have to take them in chains.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=9491" target="_blank">02:38:11.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=9492" target="_blank">02:38:12.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And Donald Trump is doing both things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=9494" target="_blank">02:38:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reason I think it's important to keep those in mind is that what Donald Trump wants, what connects a lot of different things, is that he wants leverage over things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=9501"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=9515" target="_blank">02:38:35.260</a></span> | <span class="t">But what he had over Eric Adams, he realized, was a leverage that he could get the

target="_blank">02:38:42.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So Donald Trump stepped in to save like the like the Democrat, the corrupt Democratic mayor of New York City, because not because they have a deep ideological alliance, but because then Donald Trump would have power over New York City and its policy that he wouldn't otherwise have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10621" target="_blank">02:57:01.480</a></span> | <span class="t">If you go back, if you listen to that debate on my show at Vox, I introved that debate by saying,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10626" target="_blank">02:57:06.300</a></span> | <span class="t">look, I disagree with Harris on like this specific conversation he had with Charles Murray about race and IQ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10632" target="_blank">02:57:12.020</a></span> | <span class="t">But he's good on meditation.</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10637" target="_blank">02:57:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know if I said AI back then, but I think he's good on AI.</span></div><div

Wayback Machine that Sam really thought like he really somehow got where I was wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10650" target="_blank">02:57:30.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And I thought I offered like a lot of like tries for de-escalation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10653" target="_blank">02:57:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can he did me weirdly the favor of publishing our whole email

target="_blank">02:57:41.300</a></span> | <span class="t">What I admired about him since I think the thing that he's been good on is he's been very independent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10667" target="_blank">02:57:47.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So Sam at that time, there was sort of the emergence around then of this thing that people then called the intellectual dark web.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10673" target="_blank">02:57:53.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was like Sam and the Weinstein brothers and Ben Shapiro.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10678" target="_blank">02:57:58.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And I forget who was part of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10681" target="_blank">02:58:01.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And as a bunch of those people, I think, I mean, it kind of split up over time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10685" target="_blank">02:58:05.540</a></span> | <span class="t">But Harris has done a good job not falling into conspiracy as the Weinstein brothers did, not letting his anger at the left blind him to the failures of the right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10699" target="_blank">02:58:19.100</a></span> | <span class="t">He's a guy, you know, I guess both for better and for worse, as we all are, but he is perfectly willing to stand alone in a crowd.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10705" target="_blank">02:58:25.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Like I haven't listened to that much of his stuff lately, but my sense is he's been like quite clear eyed from my perspective on Donald Trump.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10711" target="_blank">02:58:31.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So I don't think Sam, my view is not that Sam Harris is in general a bad actor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10715" target="_blank">02:58:35.620</a></span> | <span class="t">It just isn't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10716" target="_blank">02:58:36.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, he's been like difficult to categorize and fearless about it, meaning like he doesn't, he deliberately resists audience capture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10728" target="_blank">02:58:48.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So yeah, which is a hard thing to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10730" target="_blank">02:58:50.060</a></span> | <span class="t">I think I saw a clip of him on this show sort of like going after Trump and it became like a big whole thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10735" target="_blank">02:58:55.040</a></span> | <span

very consistent on that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10737" target="_blank">02:58:57.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's, let's try to find the interesting thing here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10740" target="_blank">02:59:00.780</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">02:59:04.860</a></span> | <span class="t">He studies intelligence and it was a very detailed non-policy discussion about IQ tests and all that kind of stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10755" target="_blank">02:59:15.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And there I did.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10756" target="_blank">02:59:16.700</a></span> | <span class="t">I tried extremely hard to be very nuanced because that felt like an uncomfortable topic back then.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10763" target="_blank">02:59:23.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It doesn't feel so uncomfortable now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10765" target="_blank">02:59:25.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you think the Overton window has expanded?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10768" target="_blank">02:59:28.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you think the kind of things we're willing to talk about now?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10772" target="_blank">02:59:32.020</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, this has to do with the Trump moment also.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10774" target="_blank">02:59:34.460</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the place where the topic seems to me to have changed in my ambient awareness of it is two things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10782" target="_blank">02:59:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">One is a sense of the Flynn effect, which is, yeah, it's hard to individually change your IQ, but there is a very well-documented effect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10789" target="_blank">02:59:49.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And I talked to James Flynn before I talked to Sam.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10791" target="_blank">02:59:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">There is a very well-documented effect where IQs have been rising over time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10796" target="_blank">02:59:56.600</a></span> | <span class="t">There's good evidence now that that has stopped.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10800" target="_blank">03:00:00.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, this is ambiently my sense, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10804" target="_blank">03:00:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I've read some things like in passing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10805" target="_blank">03:00:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I have not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10806" target="_blank">03:00:06.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I did not come to this podcast preparing to talk about IQ or I would have prepared very carefully.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10810" target="_blank">03:00:10.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there was an interesting FT article just the other day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10813" target="_blank">03:00:13.240</a></span> | <span class="t">It was like, have we passed peak human intelligence?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10816" target="_blank">03:00:16.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And my sense is not is that that wasn't about IQ, although, again, like I don't remember exactly what was in it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10821" target="_blank">03:00:21.300</a></span> | <span class="t">I kind of glanced at it and put it aside to read more later.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10823" target="_blank">03:00:23.780</a></span> | <span class="t">But that literacy scores are going down and a number of test scores are going down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10827" target="_blank">03:00:27.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And the sort of sense of the piece was that we are making ourselves stupider by endlessly staring at screens and social media, which I think is probably right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10837" target="_blank">03:00:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I've had this sort of line since becoming aware of that piece in my head that we spend a lot of time talking about how to get smarter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10844" target="_blank">03:00:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and not enough time talking about how to avoid getting dumber.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10848" target="_blank">03:00:48.020</a></span> | <span class="t">But we do a lot of things that a lot of things that we think make us smarter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10851" target="_blank">03:00:51.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Like I would say having social media on our phones because like, oh, you're getting all this information all the time that in fact make us dumber.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10857" target="_blank">03:00:57.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Because it's not just that the information is bad, but the lack of concentration, the constant distraction, the sort of lack of focus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10865" target="_blank">03:01:05.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And so my sense is that there is a different kind of conversation here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10869" target="_blank">03:01:09.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not sure it's really an IQ conversation, but that there is a sense that we are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10874" target="_blank">03:01:14.420</a></span> | <span class="t">inflicting a possibly global, certainly societal, cognitive wound on ourselves, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10882" target="_blank">03:01:22.620</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what John Height's book is a little bit about, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10884" target="_blank">03:01:24.580</a></span> | <span class="t">That's sort of more coming at it from a behavioral standpoint.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10886" target="_blank">03:01:26.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But we have, you know, the Flynn effect reflects, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10890" target="_blank">03:01:30.820</a></span> | <span

<span class="t">The Flynn effect reflects societies putting on, as he, I think, put it, the scientific spectacles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10899" target="_blank">03:01:39.580</a></span> | <span class="t">You create societies where we prize things like reading, abstract intelligence, symbolic logic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10905" target="_blank">03:01:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You teach people and them a lot, and we get better and better and better at doing it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10909" target="_blank">03:01:49.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And I mean, reading changes the brain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10911" target="_blank">03:01:51.720</a></span> | <span class="t">It changes the physical structure of the brain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10913" target="_blank">03:01:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">You're hijacking parts of the mind meant for other purposes to do this kind of interpretive work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10918" target="_blank">03:01:58.440</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's, of course, possible just as we became societally connected and then made more and more widespread technologies like literacy that changed our brains and led to the increase in this thing we call G, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10930" target="_blank">03:02:10.520</a></span> | <span class="t">G

things, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10933" target="_blank">03:02:13.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, I'm really shitty at knowing which direction I'm going into this sort of part of my brain that does navigation is terribly atrophied compared to somebody in a more, in a society that did not have Google

concern about AI is we're going to make ourselves much stupider without realizing it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=10965" target="_blank">03:02:45.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Because the things that are easy to automate in AI, which is like getting the AI to summarize the reading of something or getting AI to write

think if you look at what's happening right now in mRNA cancer vaccines, in CAR T cell therapy for redesigning T cells to attack cancers, if you look at the GLP-1 drug revolution and some of these studies that have been done on the fact that GLP-1 drugs, while they were initially synthesized from lizard venom to help people with type 2 diabetes, turn out to have these effects that seem to reduce body-wide inflammation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=11218" target="_blank">03:06:58.440</a></span> | <span class="t">That

those 10,000 materials can do or synthesize knowledge so people can combine it and say, we're going to take a little bit of CRISPR over here and a little bit of cancer science over here to develop a

us infinite solar energy, the sun's actual energy in a particular location.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=11363"

target="_blank">03:09:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And I do I am incredibly optimistic that we might be at the cusp of a real golden age in taking all these little ingredients that we've spent decades on, whether it's genomics and proteomics and a little bit of AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=11392" target="_blank">03:09:52.760</a></span> | <span class="t">We're at the at a moment right now, I hope we can have this explosion of combinatorial intelligence and that hopefully in an optimistic way,

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=11410" target="_blank">03:10:10.220</a></span> | <span class="t">These are discoveries that are going to happen inside of institutions and how those institutions work and how they're funded.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=11417" target="_blank">03:10:17.640</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=11423" target="_blank">03:10:23.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's why I think it's really important to not only be obsessed with what the technology can do, but how it's instantiated in the institutions that we have, because it ultimately is institutions and individuals that build the world, not technology acting on its own.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=11436" target="_blank">03:10:36.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, and I should say that you make a really great case for investing in weird science, meaning stuff that doesn't on the surface make sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=11443" target="_blank">03:10:43.340</a></span> | <span class="t">We said lizard venom, you know, there's all this popular criticism of scientific projects that sound like a waste of money, when in reality, at least in the scientific realm, projects that seem like they don't have any positive effect might actually end up being the ones that transform human civilization as we know it, because of the unintended discoveries that happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=11466" target="_blank">03:11:06.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And all the eureka moments, all the special discoveries happen, truly, when you're just passionately pursuing a cool thing in science, that's how scientific minds work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=11478" target="_blank">03:11:18.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it makes sense to invest in things that, in exploring weird shit, the weird mysteries of the universe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo&t=11487" target="_blank">03:11:27.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So anyway, Ezra, what gives you hope?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

the advantages of the 90s of, you know, much of the life that I have grown up in is that much of the structure of technology of global governance was fairly stable.</span></div><div class="c"><span

sort of miss, sort of feel about the way history is accelerated is that things have just all gotten faster and less predictable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

we do invent and deploy the clean energy technologies that deliver energy abundance, not just a kind of answer to the worst of climate change, but genuine energy abundance, unlocking new things like
