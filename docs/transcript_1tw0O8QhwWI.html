For the choir director, El Shoshanim, a duth of Asaph, a psalm. Oh shepherd of Israel, give ear. You who guide Joseph like a flock. You who are enthroned above the cherubim, shine forth. Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up your might and come to save us.</p><p>Oh God, restore us. And cause your face to shine upon us that we would be saved. Oh Yahweh, God of hosts, how long will you smolder against the prayer of your people? You have fed them with the bread of tears and you have made them to drink tears in large measure.</p><p>You set us as an object of strife to our neighbors and our enemies mock us among themselves. Oh God of hosts, restore us. And cause your face to shine upon us that we might be saved. You removed a vine from Egypt. You drove out the nations and then you planted it.</p><p>You cleared the ground before it and it took deep root and filled the land. The mountains were covered with its shadow. And the cedars of God with its boughs. It sent out its branches to the sea and it shoots to the river. Why have you broken down its hedges so that all who pass that way pick its fruit?</p><p>A boar from the forest devours it and whatever moves in the field feeds on it. Oh God of hosts, return now, we beseech you. Look down from heaven and see and visit this vine. Even the sapling which your right hand has planted. And on the son whom you have strengthened for yourself.</p><p>It is burned with fire, it is cut down. They perish at the rebuke of your face. Let your hand be upon the man of your right hand. Upon the son of man whom you made strong for yourself. Then we shall not turn back from you. Revive us and we will call upon your name.</p><p>Oh Yahweh, God of hosts, restore us. Cause your face to shine upon us that we might be saved. Be saved. (silence)</p></div></div></body></html>
