We argued with each other. We warned each other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1teOI0x6C8&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Tolerance in that situation meant, "I think you are wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1teOI0x6C8&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.000</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:04:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I will not support the use of anybody else using force or coercion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1teOI0x6C8&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I won't support the government or any agency or mob to compel or coerce you to change your mind."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1teOI0x6C8&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what tolerance meant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1teOI0x6C8&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Both people claiming to believe something that is more true, more right, more beautiful than the other person, and both of them defending the freedom of the other person to believe what they consider to be false.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1teOI0x6C8&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, the new tolerance does not start with the assumption that there is such a thing as objective truth or objective right and wrong or objective beauty and ugliness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1teOI0x6C8&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Therefore, it does not start with the assumption that any given viewpoint or belief is objectively better than one that is believing something different, because there is no objective truth or morality out there for an idea to conform to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1teOI0x6C8&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the old tolerance becomes impossible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1teOI0x6C8&t=322" target="_blank">00:05:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Tolerance no longer means defending a person's freedom to tell me I'm wrong, but now means renouncing the right to tell anyone they are wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1teOI0x6C8&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The very concept of labeling a person's idea as wrong or defective or harmful or evil is considered intolerant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1teOI0x6C8&t=348" target="_blank">00:05:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the new tolerance is the requirement that nobody pass judgment on another person's beliefs or ideas as less true, less right, less beautiful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1teOI0x6C8&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reason I say this is a new form of intolerance is that in the new tolerance I am forbidden from expressing my belief that certain things are so, namely that your beliefs are wrong or harmful, dangerous.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1teOI0x6C8&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, the new tolerance sometimes goes so far as not just to forbid the expression of my belief that your belief is wrong, but goes further and forbids me even from believing that you are wrong, because they would say believing that shows I'm hateful and a danger to society</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1teOI0x6C8&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and eventually may be locked away or punished in some other way for simply holding a viewpoint.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1teOI0x6C8&t=417" target="_blank">00:06:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If you want to read more about the development of this new tolerance, then Don Carson's book, The Intolerance of Tolerance is the place to go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1teOI0x6C8&t=428" target="_blank">00:07:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So my answer to the question that was asked is absolutely Christians should be tolerant of other people's religious beliefs, namely with the old tolerance, not the new tolerance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1teOI0x6C8&t=440" target="_blank">00:07:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That is, we should be free to name each other's beliefs as false, defective, inferior, harmful, without being accused of hate or injustice or lack of love.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1teOI0x6C8&t=459" target="_blank">00:07:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, we must defend the fact that calling error ever may be the very loving thing to do if it's done in the right spirit, that is, a spirit that desires the good of the other person, not a hateful spirit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1teOI0x6C8&t=477" target="_blank">00:07:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We don't want bad things to happen to another person.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1teOI0x6C8&t=480" target="_blank">00:08:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We want good things to happen, and that's why we speak truth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1teOI0x6C8&t=484" target="_blank">00:08:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So saying that we definitely should be tolerant of other people's religious beliefs means that we should humbly and honestly tell them where we stand and how we understand where they stand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1teOI0x6C8&t=504" target="_blank">00:08:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and be as clear and open with the disagreement as possible, and that disagreement should not feel threatening politically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1teOI0x6C8&t=515" target="_blank">00:08:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And if we have thick enough skins, it wouldn't even have to destroy an ongoing relationship of open, honest, rough-and-tumble, give-and-take.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1teOI0x6C8&t=528" target="_blank">00:08:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And part of this tolerance that Christians should support is the insistence that we do not support the coercion of anyone's belief to be similar to our own.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1teOI0x6C8&t=545" target="_blank">00:09:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We persuade, we argue, we woo, we hold out warnings of what we think God or circumstances may bring about, and we plead.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1teOI0x6C8&t=555" target="_blank">00:09:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But we do not persecute, and we do not force, and we do not manipulate or do anything underhanded or try to bribe or do political maneuvering or use violence to change a person's mind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1teOI0x6C8&t=570" target="_blank">00:09:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what tolerance means that we believe in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1teOI0x6C8&t=574" target="_blank">00:09:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reason we believe in it—this is so important, I'll just say this finally—</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1teOI0x6C8&t=580" target="_blank">00:09:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the reason we believe in it is not simply—though this is important—it's not simply that it makes for a more civil order in a pluralistic society, protects us from violence,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1teOI0x6C8&t=595" target="_blank">00:09:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but even more essentially, it belongs to the very nature of Christianity that genuine faith in God, genuine allegiance to Jesus, genuine Christ-exalting obedience to God's Word is only possible if it is uncoerced and free.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1teOI0x6C8&t=621" target="_blank">00:10:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Therefore, the old kind of tolerance is built in to the very nature of Christianity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1teOI0x6C8&t=628" target="_blank">00:10:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the thing to grasp.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1teOI0x6C8&t=630" target="_blank">00:10:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And where so-called Christians have contradicted this tolerance in history by using force and compelling belief at the penalty of death or imprisonment,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1teOI0x6C8&t=643" target="_blank">00:10:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that has been an acting against the nature of Christianity, even if they call themselves Christians.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1teOI0x6C8&t=652" target="_blank">00:10:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'll say it again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1teOI0x6C8&t=653" target="_blank">00:10:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The answer to the question that was asked is, yes, Christians should be tolerant of other people's religious beliefs in the good, old, rough-and-tumble way of tolerance when it meant the right to express strong disagreement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1teOI0x6C8&t=672" target="_blank">00:11:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In the time when truth
