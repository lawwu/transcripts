How can we control what happens to the information that we put there?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEJOELcniY&t=75" target="_blank">00:01:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, look, always remember rule one of using the internet.

Whatever you put there and just assume everyone's going to see, would that be close?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEJOELcniY&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Rule one. Don't drink and type.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEJOELcniY&t=87" target="_blank">00:01:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Good rule.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEJOELcniY&t=88" target="_blank">00:01:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, look, assuming you're sober while you're there on Facebook, I think it's still important to think about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEJOELcniY&t=93" target="_blank">00:01:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">who's going to see this information sometime in the future.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEJOELcniY&t=96" target="_blank">00:01:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I know a lot of people, particularly in that kind of 16 to 24 age bracket, who put up stuff that I think in the future,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEJOELcniY&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">they might be sorry they put up. I know as an employer, one of the first things I do when I get a resume come in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEJOELcniY&t=109" target="_blank">00:01:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is I take a look on the internet and see what I can find out about them, see what the real them looks like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEJOELcniY&t=114" target="_blank">00:01:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, be aware that what you put on the internet is going to be seen by lots of people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEJOELcniY&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Also, be aware that sites like Facebook do give you privacy settings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEJOELcniY&t=123" target="_blank">00:02:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, by default, most stuff you put up there is available for everybody to look at.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEJOELcniY&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But you can turn that off by going into the privacy settings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEJOELcniY&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Alright, Jeremy, let's talk about email. Why is that so vulnerable and how can we keep it secure?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEJOELcniY&t=138" target="_blank">00:02:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Look, the big issue with email is that it was designed 30 years ago for academic and military networks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEJOELcniY&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It assumes trust.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEJOELcniY&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, for instance, when you get an email that says it's come from President Obama, it could have come from anybody.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEJOELcniY&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just like sending somebody a letter and writing on the back in the sender section sent from President Obama.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEJOELcniY&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's how secure it is, not secure at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEJOELcniY&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, just to answer your question about what can you do,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEJOELcniY&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">all of the email companies and big senders at the moment are trying really hard to deal with the situation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEJOELcniY&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, in fact, a really interesting company called True Domain in America has actually set up a new service</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEJOELcniY&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">where they're tracking all of the reputable senders</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEJOELcniY&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and they're getting them to sign, electronically sign, with mathematical algorithms their email.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEJOELcniY&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, in fact, quite serendipitously, Overnight Fastmail, which is my company, became the first company in the world</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEJOELcniY&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to start allowing customers to use this service.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEJOELcniY&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, that's one kind of thing you could use to protect yourself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEJOELcniY&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Sounds like something we should all look into.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEJOELcniY&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, but, I mean, regardless of whether, and I think all the email companies over time will start using this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEJOELcniY&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">regardless of whether yours does or not, just think about this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEJOELcniY&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Before you click on a link, it's in an email, think carefully.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEJOELcniY&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Perhaps you don't want to do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEJOELcniY&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What would be much better would be to open up your web browser and type it in manually.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEJOELcniY&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That way you can be sure that somebody hasn't actually hidden something in that link or in that attachment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEJOELcniY&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If it looks like it's come from a friend, tricky viruses pretend to come from your friends by using their address books, for instance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEJOELcniY&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Jeremy, good tips. We'll try and remember all of those. Thanks for your time this morning, Jeremy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pEJOELcniY&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you.</span></div></div></body></html>
