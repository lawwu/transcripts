If not to like, uh, and panel the most important debates about health policy of the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=689" target="_blank">00:11:29.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So, so what do you think was going on? I mean, the vac, the, the vaccine technology was developed at multiple sites, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=696" target="_blank">00:11:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I think Stanford had something to do with the development of the technology. Um, there were other universities that were involved in the development.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=702" target="_blank">00:11:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that were involved in the development of the technology as well. Right. And I think in the back of this conversation, I know what's buzzing, but let's just be direct here. You and I were, it was, there was a vaccine mandate at everyone that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=714" target="_blank">00:11:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">This is 2020.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=715" target="_blank">00:11:55.640</a></span> | <span class="t">2020 a bit, right. But eventually there was a vaccine mandate. If you wanted to keep your job, unless you had a religious or other, what was a medical reason, religious or medical reason, you were told you had to take the vaccine. People did what they did. Some people did. Some people, I know colleagues that falsified cards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=730" target="_blank">00:12:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I know, uh, colleagues that got nine vaccines, I, I, everything in between. Right. Um, but there, there was a, there were mandates. So to be clear, you were opposed to the lockdowns.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=741" target="_blank">00:12:21.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes. Um, and you were opposed to vaccine mandates. Were you also vocal about that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=747" target="_blank">00:12:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes. Cause that's even, I mean, that's even touchier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=749" target="_blank">00:12:29.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I was an expert witness in, uh, a number of cases on the vaccine mandates, including one that, uh, reached the Supreme Court and overturned the OSHA vaccine mandate. Um, so yeah, I mean, I was, I was locally opposed to the vaccine mandates. I was vocally opposed to the mask mandates. On the lockdowns, I am, I was vocally opposed to the school closures.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=767" target="_blank">00:12:47.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I emphasized the harm that the lockdowns did to the world's poor, right? So in April of 2020, there was a UN report, uh, that's, uh, that calculated that a hundred million people would, would be subject to starvation as a consequence of the economic dislocation caused by the lockdowns. I was opposed to that. Uh, I think the idea, um, idea that, uh, that the lockdowns were the right strategy. Well, they're, they're unique in world history of having lockdowns at the scale.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=795" target="_blank">00:13:15.640</a></span> | <span class="t">We had, um, and there were no part of previous pandemic plans where these such a lockdown of such a length of such a, uh, you know, at, at, at, of such a scale were no part of any previous pandemic plan or any, any previous pandemic management, uh, experience. Um, and it was very clear to me with my background in, uh, in, um, health policy that we were going to harm the poor. We were going to harm children and we're going to harm the working class at scale.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=823" target="_blank">00:13:43.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So the lockdowns were a luxury of the laptop class. Uh, and that's what I was advocating at the time. Um, the university wasn't just Stanford, you're right. But the, the, uh, in fact, there were almost no universities that, uh, that impaneled these kinds of, uh, discussions into 2022.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=840" target="_blank">00:14:00.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So what do you think happened? Do you think that, uh, that there was a fear? I'm not, I'm not ceding the question, leading the witness, whatever, but do you think that there was a fear among the academic and science community that if anyone, if, if it were allowed for people to, uh, to speak out or consider different aspects, uh, positive or negative about lockdowns or vaccine mandates, that somehow their existence would be at risk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=868" target="_blank">00:14:28.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Like that this got to an issue bigger than the lockdowns, um, and bigger than vaccines. Because I do, I think that this whole issue was really a question of whether or not we consider scientists experts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=881" target="_blank">00:14:41.820</a></span> | <span class="t">The word expert has become a very touchy thing. Like who gets to be called an expert, um, who, who designates which experts are really the experts. I mean, it's all, you know, all you have to do is accuse someone of misinformation and suddenly their expert card is taken away, even if they, uh, hold a position in a given area that they've.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=900" target="_blank">00:15:00.420</a></span> | <span class="t">I've been a tenured faculty member at Stanford School of Medicine for, uh, for decades, right? I've been a full professor, uh, with a long scientific back, like history of, of published papers in some of the top medical journals, the top, like statistics journals and the health policy journals and so on, economics journals. Um, and that wasn't enough, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=920" target="_blank">00:15:20.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, the, the problem is like you have, okay, let me just say one, one version of this that you can, you can go, uh, there are other, other, other aspects of play for, uh, like for instance,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=930" target="_blank">00:15:30.140</a></span> | <span class="t">I think people were genuinely scared. Scientists were genuinely scared for their own mortality, especially in the early days of the pandemic. And that, that clouded the way they thought about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=940" target="_blank">00:15:40.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Especially since there are a lot of older scientists. I'm not trying to pick on older, but there are a lot of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=944" target="_blank">00:15:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=945" target="_blank">00:15:45.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. And older people were dying more, correct?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=947" target="_blank">00:15:47.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. I mean, there's a, I mean, that was actually the most important epidemiological fact about COVID was that it was this very steep age gradient in the mortality profile. Young people, very low, low mortality risk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=959" target="_blank">00:15:59.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Older people, much higher mortality risk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=961" target="_blank">00:16:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">What was the rate of mortality among people, like 70 to 85 years old, roughly?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=965" target="_blank">00:16:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Five to 7%, somewhere in there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=967" target="_blank">00:16:07.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So not a trivial number.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=969" target="_blank">00:16:09.080</a></span> | <span class="t">No, it's huge. Like one in 20 to one in, you know, one in 18 or whatever, 14.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=973" target="_blank">00:16:13.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And that was due directly from COVID itself, not, not some, some confounding variable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=978" target="_blank">00:16:18.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Especially early in the pandemic, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=979" target="_blank">00:16:19.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=979" target="_blank">00:16:19.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So, so, so, okay. So, um, but I want to leave aside the personal fear, although I do think that played a tremendously important role in the, in the thinking about,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=989" target="_blank">00:16:29.020</a></span> | <span class="t">of, of scientists, especially since scientists as a class tend to be part of the laptop class, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=993" target="_blank">00:16:33.940</a></span> | <span class="t">People who have the, the economic resources to shield themselves from, for, for, for extended periods of time without any threat to their, their livelihood.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=1004" target="_blank">00:16:44.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's leave that aside and let's just focus on, on the, on the, what I think was, was a core dynamic, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=1014" target="_blank">00:16:54.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So, um, there's two norms, two ethical norms in science.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=1019" target="_blank">00:16:59.820</a></span> | <span class="t">It, it, and, and they were, they were, they competed with each other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=1022" target="_blank">00:17:02.920</a></span> | <span class="t">In science, free speech is an absolute must.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=1027" target="_blank">00:17:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">If you have an idea that's different from mine, you should be able to express it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=1032" target="_blank">00:17:12.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we can, you know, we, we can test each other's ideas out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=1036" target="_blank">00:17:16.200</a></span> | <span class="t">We can maybe devise an experiment to, to, to decide between us and whatever the experiment says, we'll say, okay, you're right and I'm wrong and, you know, I'll buy you dinner or something, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=1044" target="_blank">00:17:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, that's good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=1045" target="_blank">00:17:25.640</a></span> | <span class="t">That's, that's, that's how science advances.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=1047" target="_blank">00:17:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like through this kind of like, uh, this process of people talking to each other and having free speech, the ability to like come up with ideas and, and articulate them, uh, defend them is absolutely fundamental to the progress of science.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=1060" target="_blank">00:17:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Public health has a different ethical norm.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=1063" target="_blank">00:17:43.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Public health has an ethical norm of unanimity of messaging.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=1069" target="_blank">00:17:49.300</a></span> | <span class="t">The, the, the, the, the, this, this ethical norm has as its moral basis that the, that the communications that public health puts out are grounded in consensus science, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=1084" target="_blank">00:18:04.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So for instance, if I were, as I was a former professor at Stanford, I mean, emeritus professor at Stanford, I go out and say, oh, and the head director of the NIH, I go out and say, smoking is good for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=1092" target="_blank">00:18:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I've committed an ethical sin, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=1095" target="_blank">00:18:15.860</a></span> | <span class="t">I've done something really deeply wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=1097" target="_blank">00:18:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Because the scientific basis for the idea that smoking is a terrible thing for you, it really harms your health in, in, in, in concrete ways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=1103" target="_blank">00:18:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, that's, I mean, that's like rock solid in science.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=1108" target="_blank">00:18:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So the, the, the idea that I, as a person who works in public health, shouldn't go out and say smoking is good for you, that has a good ethical basis rooted in science.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=1122" target="_blank">00:18:42.740</a></span> | <span class="t">The idea that, uh, that, uh, that the, the, the, the vaccine will protect you from getting in and spreading COVID forever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=1140" target="_blank">00:19:00.060</a></span> | <span class="t">None of that was rooted in science.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=1142" target="_blank">00:19:02.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And yet the public health authorities of this country decided that they were going to enforce the same kind of ethical approach.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=1151" target="_blank">00:19:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">They have sort of ethical constrictions about that on those topics as they do to smoking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=1156" target="_blank">00:19:16.760</a></span> | <span class="t">When you say none of it was rooted in science, are you saying the science was mixed or there was literally no evidence?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=1162" target="_blank">00:19:22.520</a></span> | <span class="t">No, there's literally no science.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=1163" target="_blank">00:19:23.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So for instance, the idea that cloth masks prevent you from getting and spreading respiratory diseases.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=1168" target="_blank">00:19:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">There were a dozen randomized trials on flu before the pandemic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=1173" target="_blank">00:19:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And none of the, there was a Cochran report looking at the literature, the random, on, on, on masking and influenza.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=1182" target="_blank">00:19:42.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And they, and they concluded that the evidence was weak at best, that these kinds of cloth masking at, at, in population settings actually prevent anyone, the spread of influenza.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=1194" target="_blank">00:19:54.000</a></span> | <span

public health messaging, that's self-evidently not rooted in science, you're going to undermine the public trust in science and in public health.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=1254" target="_blank">00:20:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I will say, based on these voices that I hear from a lot, that's what they're asking for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=1259" target="_blank">00:20:59.880</a></span> | <span class="t">They're asking for the exact message that you're delivering now, which is, um, I, I'll, uh, state it differently.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=1265"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=1269" target="_blank">00:21:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And we should, we should absolutely say that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=1271" target="_blank">00:21:11.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=1271" target="_blank">00:21:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So for instance, uh, you wear a mask while you walk into the restaurant, you sit down to eat and you take your mask off and that protects you, protects you from getting and spreading COVID.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

you asked, is, could, could this public health messaging be dangerous?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=1297" target="_blank">00:21:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=1298"

conditions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=1304" target="_blank">00:21:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">It's the height of the

target="_blank">00:21:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And they're told if you wear a cloth mask, you're safe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=1311" target="_blank">00:21:51.800</a></span> | <span class="t">They go out in public and take risks that they otherwise would not have taken on the idea that they're safe wearing a cloth mask and they get COVID.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=1321" target="_blank">00:22:01.400</a></span> | <span class="t">The recommendation not rooted in science actually could end up killing people and probably did, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span

to, to, to, to, to somebody who's like, you know, uh, uh, who's, who's, who's not particularly, uh, I mean, particularly bothered by mask wearing, but they can still nevertheless end up causing harm.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=1344" target="_blank">00:22:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think it kind of did.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nCNPTkOOLA&t=1346" target="_blank">00:22:26.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank
