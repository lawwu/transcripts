How do I divide it up? So one, I don't get burned out and two, I can really check off those other really important boxes and have that adequate family time.</p><p>And I think what it is, is coming down to a couple of things. One is making sure that you always have that work-life balance. So there should be a set of non-negotiables that you have in your life on the personal side that are, take care of me first. And the second thing is, cut out the frivolous stuff.</p><p>Make time for family first, obviously. Set aside that date night once per week with your partner to get out there and make sure that you give them your undivided attention. And then the rest of that free time, go and pursue those passion projects with the aim of actually having a measurable, deliverable of launching something so you can see how the market reacts to it.</p></div></div></body></html>
