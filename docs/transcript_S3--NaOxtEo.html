Now, if you want to look at the annualized benefit, the deposit requirements were anywhere from about a month and a half to five months.</p><p>And so the annualized yield was about six to 12% on these bonuses. So what you'll see is that the lower dollar amounts you deposit, the higher kind of annualized yield you get. And so the outlier there was citizens, which would give you $500 for depositing $10,000 for five months.</p><p>And so if you annualize that, that's a 12% return, but it's only on $10,000. So if you have $10,000 and that's it, this is great. If you have a hundred thousand dollars, you'd need to find 10 offers like this, and that would probably be exhausting.</p></div></div></body></html>
