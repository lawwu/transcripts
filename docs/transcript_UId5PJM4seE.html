They tend to get pulled into the managerial matrix, which by the way, is when they stop being able to build new things, which is what causes the smart and aggressive people at those companies to leave and then come back to us and raise money and start a new right bourgeois capitalist company.</p><p>And so basically, like I viewed it as, I don't know, the economy is like 99% managerial, and if we can just keep the 1% of the old model alive, we'll keep getting new things. If the 1%, by the way, if we get snuffed, like if venture capital ever gets snuffed, it's outlawed or whatever, it just fails, right?</p><p>And there is no more venture capital. There's no more tech startups or whatever. And then at that point, the economy is going to be 100% managerial. And at that point, there will be no innovation forever. I think people might think they want that. I don't think they actually want that.</p><p>I don't think we want to live in that world.</p></div></div></body></html>
