They're very humble. Yes. Well, is it? Do you immediately? I'm suspicious. Why? I figure most people who are going to make something of themselves are arrogant. If they're willing to show it, there's a certain bravery or openness in that. I don't rule out the humble person doing great.</p><p>A lot of people who do great are humble, but I just get a wee bit like, what's up with you? You're not really humble. Are you? Oh, so like maybe the humility is a way of like avoiding confrontation. Like you don't have the confidence to actually show that you can be great.</p><p>So you're just right now. It might be efficient for them to avoid confrontation. Right. But I would just say I start thinking I don't know the real story. When I see a bit of arrogance, I'm less likely to think like it may in a way be feigned. But the feigning of arrogance is itself a kind of arrogance.</p><p>And in that sense, I'm still getting the genuine thing.</p></div></div></body></html>
