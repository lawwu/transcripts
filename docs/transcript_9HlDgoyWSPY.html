And I don't know anyone that has this card. I've never had this card. I've never had an account at Alliant. But the one interesting thing is it is a 2.5% cash back on everything card.</p><p>It does have a few hoops that you have to jump through, but no annual fee, no foreign transaction fees, does have some travel protections. It does not have a sign up bonus. And so if for whatever reason, none of the other options make sense for you. I said at the outset, I'm going to talk about cards that earn more than 2% on everything.</p><p>I think this qualifies because it's 2.5%. The only catch is it's only on up to $10,000 per billing cycle. I know that's plenty for most people. So I thought it was worth including. After that, it rolls over to 1.5%. The requirements you need to jump through to make this work is you do need to enroll in e-statements and then you do need to open up their high rate checking account, which is not very high rate.</p><p>It's 0.25%. And you need to have one deposit a month. And that could be a direct deposit, an ATM deposit, a mobile check deposit, or even a transfer from another bank. And you need to maintain a balance of $1,000 or more.</p></div></div></body></html>
