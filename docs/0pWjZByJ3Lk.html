target="_blank">00:04:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">have a reason to create multiple users on your account unless you want to kind of set up something</span></div><div class="c"><span

like create you know a notebook and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pWjZByJ3Lk&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">python script and put them in a git repository and you know just kind of go through that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pWjZByJ3Lk&t=305" target="_blank">00:05:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">workflow basically um so i normally create a directory to put my my git repository so what's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pWjZByJ3Lk&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">a git repository a git repository is a folder containing files and potentially subfolders</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pWjZByJ3Lk&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">which um uh basically uh to simplify slightly you can easily store somewhere else um and the most</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pWjZByJ3Lk&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">commonplace people store it uh is github.com how do they provide free storage of git repositories</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pWjZByJ3Lk&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">um and most interestingly git keeps a kind of a copy of every version of your files</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pWjZByJ3Lk&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and you can switch back to any previous version at any time so if you ever mess something up and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pWjZByJ3Lk&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">save it and then realize later oh i messed it up you can you can go back and get an old version</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pWjZByJ3Lk&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">so maybe before we create our own github repo we could look at a github repo so we could look at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pWjZByJ3Lk&t=371" target="_blank">00:06:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the fastai one so github as i say is just one particular company that stores git repositories</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pWjZByJ3Lk&t=378" target="_blank">00:06:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">for you um you don't have to use them there's also one called git lab um but um i don't know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pWjZByJ3Lk&t=387" target="_blank">00:06:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">most people use github so i think it's easier to go go you know be where everybody else is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pWjZByJ3Lk&t=392" target="_blank">00:06:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and so this is an example of repository um so or the name of the repository is fastai</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pWjZByJ3Lk&t=400" target="_blank">00:06:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and then that belongs to some particular person or organization in this case it belongs to an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pWjZByJ3Lk&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">organization the organization is called fastai um so if we get rid of the first of those the last</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pWjZByJ3Lk&t=412" target="_blank">00:06:52.560</a></span> | <span class="t">of those fastai's this is the organization fastai and you can see the 119 repositories that are in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pWjZByJ3Lk&t=418" target="_blank">00:06:58.720</a></span> | <span class="t">that organization so if i click on one say fast release see how the url's changed this is this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pWjZByJ3Lk&t=425" target="_blank">00:07:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">now the fastai's organization's repository called fast release so this pair of things with a slash</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pWjZByJ3Lk&t=432" target="_blank">00:07:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">is basically a unique identifier in git lab for a repository because it has the username or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pWjZByJ3Lk&t=439" target="_blank">00:07:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">organization and the repository so fastai is an organization my github username is jph00 and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pWjZByJ3Lk&t=448" target="_blank">00:07:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that also has repositories and so i can click on one like tiny pets and you can see this is now the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pWjZByJ3Lk&t=457" target="_blank">00:07:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">tiny pets repository in jph00 um okay so let's go back to the fastai repository</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pWjZByJ3Lk&t=464" target="_blank">00:07:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">so a repository as i mentioned contains folders and files and then folders can contain folders</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pWjZByJ3Lk&t=474" target="_blank">00:07:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and files they can

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pWjZByJ3Lk&t=488" target="_blank">00:08:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">particularly enforce that though um so that's what we see here there's a special file which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pWjZByJ3Lk&t=498" target="_blank">00:08:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is a file called readme or
