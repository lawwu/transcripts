And if you only have like so many words you can say a day, so many hours in the day, where is it worth the negotiating or dealmaking and where isn't it? And most people spend their time on really low level activities, coupon cutting, asking for a discount at a restaurant or whatever.</p><p>Okay, that's fine. But instead of doing that, you can just be a little bit more strategic upfront and think about if I negotiated my salary every single year, for sure, but maybe even twice a year, mid-year review time, I can never clip a coupon again and make more from just negotiating my salary.</p><p>And then a second level from that is if I could figure out how to negotiate, how to buy assets that cashflow and can do 100X or 300X return to me, then I don't even have to negotiate my salary that much because I just take the salary, use the salary, apply it to assets that I keep buying, those keep cashflowing for me.</p><p>So it's all about what level are you playing?</p></div></div></body></html>
