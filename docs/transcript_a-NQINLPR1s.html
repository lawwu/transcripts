Typically in a bear market, which we know happens roughly once every five years, the average loss is about 30%.</p><p>What you can also look forward to though is, you know, the gains can be pretty high in the good years. Five of the last 20 years, the stock market was up more than 20%. The average return was 26%. And so that's a pretty good year. Imagine compounding your asset, your net worth by that amount.</p><p>- Well, I think that is one area where real estate does stand out versus equities. That is unusual to see large drops in home prices. The real name of the game with real estate and the way you mitigate against volatility is just time. This is not a quick get in and get out strategy.</p><p>The risk of principal loss is actually, I think significantly less than in the stock market.</p></div></div></body></html>
