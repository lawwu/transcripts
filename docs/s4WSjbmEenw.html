I am working on that, but at least we have the time codes in there, so if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=76" target="_blank">00:01:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">want to jump ahead, you can find them.

All right,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to kick us off, I thought I'd talk a little bit about technology. So first off, iPhone 15 Pro is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=90" target="_blank">00:01:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">my core device. I send so many texts from my Mac. I could never really have an Android as much as I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=96" target="_blank">00:01:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">tried a few times. Honestly, because of that iMessage integration is probably the most important,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=101" target="_blank">00:01:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">but also now that I've just gotten so tied into it and then watching all these PCs crash during</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">this CrowdStrike rollout, haven't had any issues on a Mac. Love my Macs. Love my iPhone. Probably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">won't change that in the future. I really love AirPods. I actually lost my third-gen AirPods,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.600</a></span> | <span class="t">and I'm still happy enough with the second-gen ones, so I've just kept them. I did try the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=124" target="_blank">00:02:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Pro AirPods, and the AirPod Maxes didn't like those, returned them. On the computer side,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=129" target="_blank">00:02:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I use an M2 MacBook Air. Really love it. Got a great sticker on here. My other vehicle is a 401k.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Love that. Thanks to the Playing With Fire team who printed those stickers. I've had them on my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">computer ever since. Then let's see. I use a Magic Keyboard and a Magic Trackpad. I don't use an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.480</a></span> | <span class="t">actual mouse. I really want the new Magic Keyboard that has the built-in Touch ID, but I don't have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">that right now. I kind of wish I did, but it's one of those things that doesn't feel absolutely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">necessary. A couple other tech products I love that I have here. I've got this Anker Prime</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">charger, but I just love their products when it comes to charging your phone, battery backups,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.840</a></span> | <span class="t">everything like that. I have one of the, I guess this is the GAN Prime. I've just had great success</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">using them. Really big fan of those. I also have this great, Mercury sent me this Moft iPhone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">wallet that holds three cards and a couple dollar bills. It's a MagSafe charger. I really love this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">because you can fold it up and you can rest your phone on it sideways and up and down. Really love</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">this little tiny thing. On my desk, you'd see three other products. You'd see some Bose desktop</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">speakers. Honestly, I just like having good quality sound and my primary computer, I didn't even</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">mention this, is actually a Mac Mini. And so because it doesn't have audio built into it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I need some speakers. But the other two things, I have another Anker charger. I believe that this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Anker charger is called the Anker Wireless Power Wave. It's a magnetic charger. Also charges AirPods</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">if you had a MagSafe case, which I don't right now. And then I have an Elgato Stream Deck.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Now this is primarily a product made for gamers, but I absolutely love it. It's this tiny little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">device that sits on your desk and has 15 little LED buttons that you can control what they do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And so for me, if I look at it right now, I do a lot of recording and so I have it able to switch</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">cameras. So if you were to watch a video of this, you'd actually see that we have three cameras,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.520</a></span> | <span class="t">one looking at me, one looking at the desk from one side and one looking at desk from the other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">side. And so I can control that. I can control the microphone. I can mute myself. I can switch</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">between headphones and speakers. I can pause Spotify. I can mute my video or audio in a Zoom</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">call. So I have that over here too. I control the lights in this room if I wanted to. I've put all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">of these things in here. I have a couple of websites that'll quick pop open. One button just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">tabs to a couple of pages. I probably use it 50 times a day. I would highly recommend people that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">are kind of productivity efficiency people take a look at it. There's a bunch of different versions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">of Stream Decks, but I think I have the MK2 in black and I really, really like it. As for what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">is on my desk, I'm working at an Uplift desk. I got one of these back when we had a startup and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">it's just been a really solid desk for rising up and down. I like standing sometimes, sitting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">sometimes, well-built, no issues there. I'm sitting at a steel case gesture chair, which I tried a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">bunch of chairs a long time ago. And then when we were running a startup, we found this guy that I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">guess sells chairs, like premium desk chairs for offices. But we never asked where he got them. He</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">rolled up in like a beat up minivan and had these like $1,500 chairs for $500. And so we figured</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that we were hiring a bunch of people to sit at a desk all day, every day during the week that we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">should invest in quality chairs. And so when the company wound down, I took one of these steel case</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">gesture chairs home and I really like it. A few other AV things here that I'll get back to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=334" target="_blank">00:05:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">when I start talking about the podcast setup and all of that. I'm also only really trying to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">highlight my favorite things. So yeah, I might have a surge protector on this desk, but if it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">not something I really, really like, I'm not really going to highlight it because that doesn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">make sense. You might have a better recommendation than me. But when it comes to using the computer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=355" target="_blank">00:05:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to talk about some software on here that I really, really like. So first off,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I've gotten a couple emails recently about what storage backups I use. I don't think I have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=364" target="_blank">00:06:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">perfect solution for the cloud. So for a while I use Dropbox. And then when I started recording</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">videos for the podcast, we ran out of space. So I switched to Google drive because I got more space</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=375" target="_blank">00:06:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">with our Google workspace account for my phone. I back everything up on iCloud. I use photos and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">iCloud backup for messages and all that. So that's how I back up there. But the recent purchase that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=386" target="_blank">00:06:26.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I made that I am really, really happy with is the Synology 923 plus. It's a network attached</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">storage device. So it's called a disk station, DS923 plus. And imagine a little device that just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=402" target="_blank">00:06:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">has a bunch of hard drives in it that you can plug into your network at home. You can attach it to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">your computer as like a network storage drive. But the thing I love about it is that it syncs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">everything instantly with the cloud. So for example, if I'm finishing recording this episode</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=415" target="_blank">00:06:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and I take the audio and video files and I put them on that network drive, it's really fast</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=420" target="_blank">00:07:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">because it's local and it's connected via ethernet. But then that device backs everything up on it in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=427" target="_blank">00:07:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">a few folders with the cloud. So I also have three or four 22 terabyte drives in there in what's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=434" target="_blank">00:07:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">called a RAID array. So it doesn't actually use up all of the drives. I think I have three 22</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=440" target="_blank">00:07:20.560</a></span> | <span class="t">terabyte drives, but I only get 40 terabytes and it backs everything up such that if one of those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=446" target="_blank">00:07:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">drives failed, I didn't lose anything. So a lot of that archival footage from old VHS tapes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=452" target="_blank">00:07:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">old photos that are not in my current library, I put all of them there. Some of those folders</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=457" target="_blank">00:07:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">get auto backed up to Google drive. Some of them don't, but that is how I back up all of my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=462" target="_blank">00:07:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">important things on the computer. I'll try to get through this fast because I know not everyone is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=467" target="_blank">00:07:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">a Mac user, but I have an app I use every day, all the time called Alfred, which replaces the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=473" target="_blank">00:07:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">spotlight search, just has a bit more functionality than superhuman for email. It's totally the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=478" target="_blank">00:07:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">fastest email I've been using it for a long time. Highly, highly recommend everyone check it out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=484" target="_blank">00:08:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I think you could probably get back according to their website, four hours a week, maybe more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=488" target="_blank">00:08:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It is so fast. Some of the new AI features they've added, letting you query your email and just,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=495" target="_blank">00:08:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, auto write emails are so good. If someone said superhuman was going away,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=499" target="_blank">00:08:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">it might be one of the few products that I'd be like, no, like what? No, I don't want you like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=504" target="_blank">00:08:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">some things I could find alternatives with. For example, I use a loom to record a ton of videos</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">for work. I love loom. It's cross platform. Basically think of it as a really quick way</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=514" target="_blank">00:08:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to record your screen. So if you're trying to explain to someone how something works or how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=518" target="_blank">00:08:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">to do something or ask a question, I record a loom video. I send it to them. I use it a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=523" target="_blank">00:08:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">of times for async meetings. Someone says, Hey, I'd love if we could meet so you could review this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=528" target="_blank">00:08:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">project I'm working on. And then I'll just review the project, record myself for 10 minutes, send</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=532" target="_blank">00:08:52.560</a></span> | <span class="t">them the video. And now we've avoided a 30 minute meeting. I can record it whenever I want. I do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=537" target="_blank">00:08:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">that a lot. Uh, I love when people do that for me and we can kind of be more efficient. I recently</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=542" target="_blank">00:09:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">found this app called code Piper, which basically, if you have an iPhone and you've noticed when you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=547" target="_blank">00:09:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">get those two factor authentication codes, it auto pastes them into the, whatever you're doing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=553" target="_blank">00:09:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">whether it's, you're trying to fill it out on a website. It does that for the Mac. Also really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=557" target="_blank">00:09:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">love the code Piper app. If you have an iPhone and you know, when you get one of those six digit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=561" target="_blank">00:09:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">two factor authentication codes, code Piper does what happens on the iPhone naturally on your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=566" target="_blank">00:09:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">computer. So if you get a text and you need to put it into the browser and you're using Chrome or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=570" target="_blank">00:09:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">any other browser, it solves that. Another app I couldn't really live without is called rectangle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=575" target="_blank">00:09:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">It's basically a way to move things and manipulate things on your screen. So I press command option,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=582" target="_blank">00:09:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">right? And it jumps the window I'm looking at currently to the right side. And if I press it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=586" target="_blank">00:09:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">three times, it cycles between the right third, the right middle and the right two thirds. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=591" target="_blank">00:09:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">so if I'm trying to quickly split my screen between two apps, I can do it in a couple seconds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=596" target="_blank">00:09:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I love the rectangle app. It's absolutely free. They do have a pro version, but I don't even think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=600" target="_blank">00:10:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I have the pro version.

It is a recipe database, meal planning and grocery</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=611" target="_blank">00:10:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">tracking.

Also really love</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=641" target="_blank">00:10:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">another all platform app called one password. You guys have probably heard me talk about it for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=646" target="_blank">00:10:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">years.

I've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=651" target="_blank">00:10:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">forced everyone in my family to switch over.

Um, that's the main stuff. I'm going to talk briefly about Chrome</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=781" target="_blank">00:13:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">extensions because yes, apps are great, but there are some Chrome extensions that are really,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=785" target="_blank">00:13:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">really great. So one library extension, when you're browsing Amazon, it'll just show you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=791" target="_blank">00:13:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">all of the libraries that have that book in either checkout or ebook form.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=795" target="_blank">00:13:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Second is a app called points path. So when you're browsing Google flights, it actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=802" target="_blank">00:13:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">shows you all of the cost in points for the major U S airline. So like United American and Delta,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=808" target="_blank">00:13:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and it'll say, Hey, actually, you know, this flight's three 39, it's going to be 34,000</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=812" target="_blank">00:13:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">points. You should use cash, but Hey, this flight's three 39, and it's only 14,000 points</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=818" target="_blank">00:13:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and $6 in taxes.

Sometimes it's like 15, 20%, sometimes it's 2%,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=828" target="_blank">00:13:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">but almost every time it's some percent that you wouldn't have got back otherwise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=833" target="_blank">00:13:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you link your Amex account to Rakuten, instead of earning pennies, you can earn Amex</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=837" target="_blank">00:13:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">points. So if you would have gotten a hundred dollars in cash back, it would have actually been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=842" target="_blank">00:14:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">about 10,000 Amex points, which I think Amex points end up being worth more than a penny.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=847" target="_blank">00:14:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think it's a great deal.

We get most of our food from Costco,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=2505" target="_blank">00:41:45.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Amazon Fresh or Whole Foods.

It's just really good. I'm drinking the mushroom cola</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=2550" target="_blank">00:42:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">right now, which might sound crazy to some people that maybe don't like mushrooms, but is so good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=2556" target="_blank">00:42:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">in the kitchen.

Just like milk, a little sugar-free Jell-O or some xanthan gum</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=2592" target="_blank">00:43:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and protein powder. And it tastes just like ice cream. It's like a McFlurry, if that's your thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=2598" target="_blank">00:43:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I can't say enough of it.

Another product I love is the Breville Tea Maker. Now, think of a kettle that can boil</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=2609" target="_blank">00:43:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">water.

And you can set what kind of tea,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=2615" target="_blank">00:43:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and it'll boil the water, drop the basket with the loose-leaf tea in it, down, steep the tea,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=2621" target="_blank">00:43:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">bring it back up, keep it warm. We got this when I was working at a startup for the office 14 years</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=2628" target="_blank">00:43:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">ago, maybe. And that is the one we have. This thing has worked every year for 14 years in a row.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=2634" target="_blank">00:43:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Makes me really love Breville, to be honest.

Another product we have that I got as a gift, I don't remember when,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=2650" target="_blank">00:44:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">is the Waring Pro Double Belgian Waffle Maker.

Sometimes we use the Kodiak protein pancake waffle mix in it. Sometimes we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=2665" target="_blank">00:44:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">go off the cuff and make it from scratch. But this is a double Belgian waffle maker. And there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=2670" target="_blank">00:44:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">just something about Belgian waffles that are great, but making them one at a time when you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=2673" target="_blank">00:44:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">have a lot of people eating is slow.

Love this Belgian waffle</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=2678" target="_blank">00:44:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">maker.

So I don't like hard</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=2693" target="_blank">00:44:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">boiled eggs.

And then the last is, I've talked a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=2943" target="_blank">00:49:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">lot about how we have a au pair in the house, and we're going through the process of looking for our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=2947" target="_blank">00:49:07.600</a></span> | <span class="t">next au pair now. And for the next one, we've used Cultural Care as an au pair agency, and it's been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=2953" target="_blank">00:49:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">really great. You can filter on as many criteria as you want, connect with au pairs, interview them,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=2958" target="_blank">00:49:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">they kind of do all the sourcing so you don't have to worry about it. And they take care of all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=2961" target="_blank">00:49:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">logistics and the visa and that kind of stuff. So we've had a really great experience with all our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=2965" target="_blank">00:49:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">au pairs from Cultural Care. Not really a child, but we do have a dog. And three things that I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=2970" target="_blank">00:49:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">thought I'd flag there. One, Sunday's dog food. And we tried this new dog food Sundays a couple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=2976" target="_blank">00:49:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">years ago, and all the problems were gone.

So big fan of theirs. I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=2987" target="_blank">00:49:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">even know the brand, but we have this burrowing dog bed that's kind of like an igloo, if you would,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=2992" target="_blank">00:49:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">but it's really just pops up a little and the dog can like kind of snuggle under it. Our dog's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=2997" target="_blank">00:49:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">visual and absolutely loves this dog bed. And then last, there's a really cool product called</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=3002" target="_blank">00:50:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the Night Eyes Rad Dog, and it's a collar leash combo. If you're ever spending a lot of time in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=3008" target="_blank">00:50:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">like an off leash dog park, it's a collar, but it has a dog leash attached to the collar. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=3013" target="_blank">00:50:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">really like that product.

For all of our banking, I think my favorite picks are Brex and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=3058" target="_blank">00:50:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Mercury.

So this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=3140" target="_blank">00:52:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is like a nerdy optimizer's dream.

So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=3201" target="_blank">00:53:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">really awesome product there. For the podcast, for anyone interested, we have a bunch of different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=3207" target="_blank">00:53:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">things we use.

For editing the audio</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=3212" target="_blank">00:53:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and the video, I'm doing all of my side on Descript.

All the camera feeds route through this little device,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=3418" target="_blank">00:56:58.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and it's hooked up to a Samsung SSD or a solid state drive, and it records all the camera feeds</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=3426" target="_blank">00:57:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">separately from the SD cards that are in the camera just in case there was an SD card failure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=3431" target="_blank">00:57:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">If you go back to episode one with Lee Rowan on Travel Tips, you will find that that was the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=3437" target="_blank">00:57:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">second time we recorded that podcast because the first time the SD card failed, and there was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=3443" target="_blank">00:57:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">nothing I could do. I sent it to a repair company up in San Francisco, tried to salvage the data,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=3448" target="_blank">00:57:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">couldn't get it. Ever since then, every bit of audio I record, every video I record,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=3454" target="_blank">00:57:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">everything's redundant. We're getting two recordings for everything. That's how we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=3460" target="_blank">00:57:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">doing it. I think that's it. I think I've covered all the highlights of the products I use and love</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=3466" target="_blank">00:57:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">on a daily basis. There are so many more things. I'm sure if I just walked around the room,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=3470" target="_blank">00:57:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">there'd be other things. I'm curious if there are any categories I left off that people want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=3475" target="_blank">00:57:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">hear. I can save that for a future episode. Otherwise, thank you so much for listening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=3479" target="_blank">00:57:59.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I hope this was interesting. You can find links to everything I talked about in the show notes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WSjbmEenw&t=3483" target="_blank">00:58:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">including discounts and promo codes.
