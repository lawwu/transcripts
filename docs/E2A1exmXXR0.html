Spirit is inside of us, and he overcomes our old habits gradually to keep us humble.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2A1exmXXR0&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If you were to ask me, "Pastor John, why does God take so long to make me good?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2A1exmXXR0&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm 68 years old and I'm still asking that question.</span></div><div

good?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2A1exmXXR0&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And my answer is I think he keeps us humble and he keeps us broken and he keeps us desperate for himself and desperate for grace so that we don't get our pride up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2A1exmXXR0&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, here's something amazing from 1 John 1, 7.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2A1exmXXR0&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It says, "If we say we have no sin, we're not walking in the light.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2A1exmXXR0&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But if we're walking in the light, we confess our sins."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2A1exmXXR0&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, that's amazing because it says, "Therefore, walking in the light," that means having a good relationship with God, "includes confessing sin," which can't mean that walking in the light means sinlessness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2A1exmXXR0&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It

a good relationship with God is not that you don't ever sin, but that you recognize your sin because light is shining in your heart, and you confess it, and you say you're sorry to God for it, and you ask Jesus to cover it with his blood.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2A1exmXXR0&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.000</a></span> | <span

Christians must learn to deal with the fact that we continue to sin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2A1exmXXR0&t=349"
