them to be getting golds at the IMO, but I imagine it's something that looks a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnMPfCFp6TA&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.840</a></span> | <span class="t">bit like how AlphaGo is trained, where you have it, like, play with itself a whole bunch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
