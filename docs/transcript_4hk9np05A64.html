Is there something you wish, in the way the institutions were set up at the time and were cared for now, that you would maybe change?</p><p>There was a key opportunity in the unipolar moment. How should that have been used? How well was it used? I think it was myself and President Clinton who took the crucial decision to bring China into the world's trading framework. The G7 at the time was the G8, with Russia there, and China would always be invited.</p><p>I think we did try. I honestly think we tried a lot to recognize that we were going to live in a new world. The power was going to not shift from the West, in the sense that the West would become not powerful, but the East was going to become also powerful.</p><p>I think we kind of did understand that and worked towards that. The problem is that, and particularly in these last few years, certainly China and Russia have come to a position that is, in terms of fundamental values and systems, seemingly hostile to Western democracy. We live in a multipolar world today.</p><p>Personally, I think that's a good thing. I think in any event, it's an inevitable thing. I think it's really important always to give this message to China, for example. China, as of right, is one of the big powers in the world, and as of right, should have a huge influence.</p><p>I don't believe in trying to constrain or contain China, but we do have to accept that the Chinese system, as it presently is, is run on different lines to our own and is overtly, in some degree, hostile; which is why it's important for us to retain military and technological superiority, even though I believe passionately that it's important that we leave space for cooperation and engagement with China.</p><p>Now, how much could we have foreseen of all of this back in those days? I'm not sure, but I think sometimes one of the problems of the West is that we always see it through our own lens, and we always think, "Well, we could have done something different to change the world." But actually, the rest of the world operates on its own principles as well.</p><p>Sometimes the change happens not because we didn't do something, but because the rest of the world did.
