They were all selected. And I will tell you this story about a certain person</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdL5QZ3FHCI&t=1055" target="_blank">00:17:35.660</a></span> | <span class="t">there, because when they were taking the photograph, and I think maybe 45 or 50 of the 100 actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdL5QZ3FHCI&t=1062" target="_blank">00:17:42.620</a></span> | <span class="t">showed up at this big party. I was going to have Mike Nolan stand in for somebody for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdL5QZ3FHCI&t=1068" target="_blank">00:17:48.140</a></span> | <span class="t">the photo, but I said to this young woman, I've always had this attractive young woman</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdL5QZ3FHCI&t=1073" target="_blank">00:17:53.980</a></span> | <span class="t">at these things, I know, and I said, "You know, I feel like I'm a little boy with a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdL5QZ3FHCI&t=1081" target="_blank">00:18:01.980</a></span> | <span class="t">bunch of giants." And she said, "Oh, Mr. Vogel, I'm sure everybody in the room feels that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdL5QZ3FHCI&t=1086" target="_blank">00:18:06.980</a></span> | <span class="t">way." And I said, "I'll bet Jack Welch doesn't." His claim to fame is he's created the biggest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdL5QZ3FHCI&t=1099" target="_blank">00:18:19.020</a></span> | <span class="t">loss of shareholder capital market cap of any businessman in history, $400 billion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdL5QZ3FHCI&t=1105" target="_blank">00:18:25.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Gee, he's gone down. But he's irrepressible, I'll tell you that. He has a girlfriend, his</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdL5QZ3FHCI&t=1111" target="_blank">00:18:31.880</a></span> | <span class="t">young wife, whatever. So that's another award. Then we get to the icons from Philadelphia</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdL5QZ3FHCI&t=1120" target="_blank">00:18:40.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Inquirer, or from Investment News, I should say, first. And the other winner was Charles</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdL5QZ3FHCI&t=1125" target="_blank">00:18:45.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Schwab, who I think probably deserves it. And there were just the two of us, and he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdL5QZ3FHCI&t=1129" target="_blank">00:18:49.660</a></span> | <span class="t">didn't show up, so I got an extra five minutes to talk, which was nice. And then we had icons</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdL5QZ3FHCI&t=1135" target="_blank">00:18:55.940</a></span> | <span class="t">again here in Philadelphia. Philadelphia Business Hall of Fame, five leaders of impact has stretched</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdL5QZ3FHCI&t=1144" target="_blank">00:19:04.580</a></span> | <span class="t">beyond the city. And there they are. You'll see the fellow over on the left. So that was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdL5QZ3FHCI&t=1150" target="_blank">00:19:10.940</a></span> | <span class="t">very nice. Well, I keep thinking, "Icon, isn't that one of those things on your computer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdL5QZ3FHCI&t=1154" target="_blank">00:19:14.860</a></span> | <span class="t">that you go click?" So maybe that's what it's about. And that resulted in a nice article,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdL5QZ3FHCI&t=1162" target="_blank">00:19:22.060</a></span> | <span class="t">which you can see quickly here, a nice picture from the Inquirer. And then that was the third</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdL5QZ3FHCI&t=1169" target="_blank">00:19:29.020</a></span> | <span class="t">award. And the fourth one is coming up. And this award, I like the Forbes award, which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdL5QZ3FHCI&t=1177" target="_blank">00:19:37.300</a></span> | <span class="t">I thought was interesting. And not only the creative idea, but the impact that practical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdL5QZ3FHCI&t=1183" target="_blank">00:19:43.260</a></span> | <span class="t">application of the idea has made in improving the economic well-being of individuals and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdL5QZ3FHCI&t=1191" target="_blank">00:19:51.460</a></span> | <span class="t">industry or a nation. And that's the kind of award I would like to win. My wife said</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdL5QZ3FHCI&t=1197" target="_blank">00:19:57.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I couldn't go to Florida to get it, and I shouldn't have done it anyway. But then they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdL5QZ3FHCI&t=1202" target="_blank">00:20:02.060</a></span> | <span class="t">said they'd send a plane. We'll just send a plane, that's all. And so we're still negotiating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdL5QZ3FHCI&t=1210" target="_blank">00:20:10.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So whether I will have to do it by video, and I kind of like to do it there, because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdL5QZ3FHCI&t=1214" target="_blank">00:20:14.940</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm receiving it with Matt McQuown, who was big in the thinking of this product out of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdL5QZ3FHCI&t=1220" target="_blank">00:20:20.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Wells Fargo. And so I'd like to do it, and I guess that we probably will do it. But I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdL5QZ3FHCI&t=1227" target="_blank">00:20:27.980</a></span> | <span class="t">don't travel alone.

And so if Eve doesn't do it, and we have a good time together, don't we,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdL5QZ3FHCI&t=1245" target="_blank">00:20:45.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Mike? Absolutely, of course. I like that. Okay, that's enough awards, I think, for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdL5QZ3FHCI&t=1250" target="_blank">00:20:50.060</a></span> | <span class="t">moment, for a year. I don't know. For someone who wrote the book called Enough. And so the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdL5QZ3FHCI&t=1258" target="_blank">00:20:58.180</a></span> | <span class="t">big part of spreading the word is what I do myself, not what others do for me. And so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdL5QZ3FHCI&t=1263" target="_blank">00:21:03.820</a></span> | <span class="t">I include articles, editorials, speeches, and books that I've done, and we'll just review</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdL5QZ3FHCI&t=1267" target="_blank">00:21:07.420</a></span> | <span class="t">them very quickly. The articles is the cover story. You've probably seen it in Bloomberg</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdL5QZ3FHCI&t=1272" target="_blank">00:21:12.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Markets.

And so it was nice to see the cover story. It was a decent interview.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdL5QZ3FHCI&t=1286" target="_blank">00:21:26.140</a></span> | <span class="t">I probably said a few things I shouldn't have, which is what makes it decent. And then, I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdL5QZ3FHCI&t=1292" target="_blank">00:21:32.580</a></span> | <span class="t">mean, there are so many of these articles, I mean, you can't even keep up with them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdL5QZ3FHCI&t=1297" target="_blank">00:21:37.900</a></span> | <span class="t">But another one that was particularly nice was from BBC Britain, about 50 Inventions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdL5QZ3FHCI&t=1303" target="_blank">00:21:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that Shaped the Modern Economy.

But what happened, this is the text of the article, I'm just going to go through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdL5QZ3FHCI&t=1315" target="_blank">00:21:55.420</a></span> | <span class="t">a little bit. A practical businessman paid attention to an academic economist's suggestion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdL5QZ3FHCI&t=1321" target="_blank">00:22:01.860</a></span> | <span class="t">He then tells the story. What could be simpler and cheaper than an index fund recommended</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdL5QZ3FHCI&t=1326" target="_blank">00:22:06.340</a></span> | <span class="t">by the world's most expensive, most respected economist? And that would be Paul Samuelson,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdL5QZ3FHCI&t=1331" target="_blank">00:22:11.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Nobel Laureate.

He did the introduction to my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdL5QZ3FHCI&t=1376" target="_blank">00:22:56.260</a></span> | <span class="t">first book, which I don't think I've told you this story before, but I sent Dr. Samuelson</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdL5QZ3FHCI&t=1383" target="_blank">00:23:03.660</a></span> | <span class="t">to me the manuscript for my first book, Bogle and Mutual Funds.

John, this is Paul Samuelson. I don't do blurbs anymore. The blurb has been devalued,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdL5QZ3FHCI&t=1411" target="_blank">00:23:31.820</a></span> | <span class="t">a coin that has been devalued. However, I would like to do the introduction. And when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdL5QZ3FHCI&t=1418" target="_blank">00:23:38.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I was picked up off the floor, I said, well, can I have a day to think about that?

Millionaire,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdL5QZ3FHCI&t=1433" target="_blank">00:23:53.940</a></span> | <span class="t">German. Bonka, John.

Meister</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdL5QZ3FHCI&t=1445" target="_blank">00:24:05.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Bogle.
