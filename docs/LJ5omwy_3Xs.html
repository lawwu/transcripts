And that is so far from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=779" target="_blank">00:12:59.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the truth that I felt compelled to write a letter to the editor of the journal about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=783" target="_blank">00:13:03.080</a></span> | <span class="t">it.

And number two, I don't even agree with him. He's a very strong-minded,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=801" target="_blank">00:13:21.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and I can't say that I'm right and he's wrong. But what does one say about a hypothesis that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=807" target="_blank">00:13:27.080</a></span> | <span class="t">is sometimes right and sometimes wrong? Sometimes markets are efficient. Sometimes markets are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=813" target="_blank">00:13:33.080</a></span> | <span class="t">inefficient. And we never really quite know when, but we do know from the work I've done,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=818" target="_blank">00:13:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and I'm going to show you a little bit this morning, that in the long run, they're highly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=824" target="_blank">00:13:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">efficient, and in the short run, this is stock value relative to bonds, what kind of efficiency.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=830" target="_blank">00:13:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And in the short run, that could be years, even decades of inefficiency. So I don't subscribe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=835" target="_blank">00:13:55.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to the theory, and that gave rise for me to tell the journal that the EMH had nothing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=843" target="_blank">00:14:03.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to make an efficient markets hypothesis. So I had to come up with a nice resounding counter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=848" target="_blank">00:14:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to that, which I call the CMH, the cost matters hypothesis.

So I'm going to talk a little bit about Nobel One, which is Gene Fama. What</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=927" target="_blank">00:15:27.080</a></span> | <span class="t">does that thing say? Oh yeah. Oh, this is the interesting point. I told the journalist,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=935" target="_blank">00:15:35.080</a></span> | <span class="t">he likes indexing so much, maybe he's the father of indexing or something somehow. Why</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=940" target="_blank">00:15:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">did he start a non-index firm called BFA, Dimensional Fund Advisors? He believes there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=947" target="_blank">00:15:47.080</a></span> | <span class="t">are sections of the market that are permanently undervalued, persistently undervalued. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=954" target="_blank">00:15:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't have to believe that. And BFA has built a big business, a highly profitable</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=960" target="_blank">00:16:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">business, on the very idea that you can find a lot of Japanese small cap stocks, for example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=968" target="_blank">00:16:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">or value stocks, or small cap stocks generally. And sometimes he's right and sometimes he's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=973" target="_blank">00:16:13.080</a></span> | <span class="t">wrong. He doesn't tell you too much about the latter. So that first one, let me get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=979" target="_blank">00:16:19.080</a></span> | <span class="t">my copy of it here. I'm going to keep looking around and wait for the night. And then, what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=996" target="_blank">00:16:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">do I want to do next? We'll come to this in one second. He says, he doesn't believe there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1004" target="_blank">00:16:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">such thing as bubbles. And I'm going to show you there are such thing as bubbles, and anybody</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1009" target="_blank">00:16:49.080</a></span> | <span class="t">should be able to figure it out. So let's go to that next slide, Mike. Bob Shiller,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1020" target="_blank">00:17:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">who you probably know about. He has his way of looking at markets in 10-year or 15-year</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1025" target="_blank">00:17:05.080</a></span> | <span class="t">aggregate earnings. He's perfectly valuable. Sometimes he's right, sometimes he's wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1030" target="_blank">00:17:10.080</a></span> | <span class="t">But he is another Nobel laureate for the year. And he disagrees with Gene Common. And as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1039" target="_blank">00:17:19.080</a></span> | <span class="t">he says, he thinks efficient markets is the most damaging investment hypothesis in history.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1047" target="_blank">00:17:27.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So I did tell the journal in my book, I was a little over the top. I mean, that was Charlie</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1054" target="_blank">00:17:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Fawcett. So they raise these issues, and it's the issue of who two guys win the Nobel Prize,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1066" target="_blank">00:17:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and they disagree. Let me talk about, and Burt Malfield, because I'm wrong on this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1071" target="_blank">00:17:51.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you should know that. But let's see how I'm going to look at the markets if there are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1076" target="_blank">00:17:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">bubbles. Can there be bubbles? Well, one way to look at it is the economic capitalization</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1081" target="_blank">00:18:01.080</a></span> | <span class="t">relative to our gross domestic product, the reality of GDP, the national economy, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1088" target="_blank">00:18:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the total capitalization of the stock market. And it got up to, you can see that the market</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1095" target="_blank">00:18:15.080</a></span> | <span class="t">cap was twice the stock market, 1.82 times. And that was in the bubble of 2000, the tech</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1101" target="_blank">00:18:21.080</a></span> | <span class="t">bubble, and it came down below in 2009 to 8.84. Well, that's because stocks had a bubble</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1110" target="_blank">00:18:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">in them. The intrinsic value of stocks, measured by GDP, was vastly exceeded by the market</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1121" target="_blank">00:18:41.080</a></span> | <span class="t">value of stocks, people's expectations. So you can see hints of a bubble there. I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1126" target="_blank">00:18:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">think you need to look at this over long periods of time. But you can see there are big jumps</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1130" target="_blank">00:18:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">in those. I don't think it has a time factor in it. Actually, there are a lot of factors</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1134" target="_blank">00:18:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that go into it. But you can see what it was doing in 1929, what it was doing even when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1140" target="_blank">00:19:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the '40s began. You can see the '70, '72, '74 crash, '81 to '37. And the dimensions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1149" target="_blank">00:19:09.080</a></span> | <span class="t">of these things are not too far off. There's a cut in half, and again, cut in half in '82</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1154" target="_blank">00:19:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to '84. So there is persistent overvaluation, and then it changes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1161" target="_blank">00:19:21.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Another good one, people don't look at these things very often, and this is really quite</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1166" target="_blank">00:19:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">striking. This is the value of the prices Dow Jones averaged relative to... Did we get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1175" target="_blank">00:19:35.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that title right? No, we got the right title, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1178" target="_blank">00:19:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">It's the market valuation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1180" target="_blank">00:19:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. This is the market value of Dow relative to the book value of Dow. And we'll fix that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1188" target="_blank">00:19:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">up in round two, and I can repeat this to you tomorrow morning or something. And you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1193" target="_blank">00:19:53.080</a></span> | <span class="t">can see for eight times, the market value is eight times the book value, where a norm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1198" target="_blank">00:19:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">looks to be two and a half to three times. And things change over time, I know that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1203" target="_blank">00:20:03.080</a></span> | <span class="t">But eight times does seem, to any normal person at least, a little over the top. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1208" target="_blank">00:20:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">it reverts to normal, which is where it is now. And both of those things suggest that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1213" target="_blank">00:20:13.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the market is in broad range and fairly valued then. It's a hype, it's a hype of the world,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1218" target="_blank">00:20:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you don't really need to worry about it. But that's the way it seems to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1223" target="_blank">00:20:23.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And you've all seen, this is something you've seen before, and I just want to show you something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1227" target="_blank">00:20:27.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you've had. I've used this chart for a long, long time, and it's the sources of stock market</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1233" target="_blank">00:20:33.080</a></span> | <span class="t">returns over the decade. And you can see investment return. This is a long-term return created</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1239" target="_blank">00:20:39.080</a></span> | <span class="t">by business, in effect, dividend yield being entered, earnings growth that follows. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1244" target="_blank">00:20:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you can see it's pretty steady. You know, eight percent, six percent, big 14 there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1250" target="_blank">00:20:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, thanks, Bill. I'll try and keep my eye on that. And then this last decade, of course,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1255" target="_blank">00:20:55.080</a></span> | <span class="t">very poor, in part because it starts with such a terrible dividend yield. And you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1261" target="_blank">00:21:01.080</a></span> | <span class="t">see how it all comes out, dividend yield, earnings growth, and there's where the 9.3%</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1265" target="_blank">00:21:05.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you read about in the market comes from. The speculative return is whether those P/Es</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1270" target="_blank">00:21:10.080</a></span> | <span class="t">are rising, valuations are rising or falling. And you can see really an odd pattern of reversion</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1276" target="_blank">00:21:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">of the mean here. I don't know how much to read into it, but it's the way things happen</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1280" target="_blank">00:21:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">in the market. And that is, speculative return was a big drag on returns in the 1910s, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1286" target="_blank">00:21:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">it had almost exactly the same amount in the 1920s. Big drag on return in the '40s.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1292" target="_blank">00:21:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And on a slightly larger improvement in returns in the '50s. A big drag in the '70s.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1299" target="_blank">00:21:39.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Exactly commensurate increase in the '80s, taking 7.5% off the investment return and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1306" target="_blank">00:21:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">adding 7.7%. And then for the first time in history, repeats itself in the next decade.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1311" target="_blank">00:21:51.080</a></span> | <span class="t">That in itself is a warning sign. So you can see where these returns come from and what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1315" target="_blank">00:21:55.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you can count on. The whole point of this is it's all about fundamental returns, investment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1320" target="_blank">00:22:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">returns, owning corporate America, and not owning the markets. So we look at this, use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1327" target="_blank">00:22:07.080</a></span> | <span class="t">this chart, and I'll show you one new one. But you can see how closely in the long run</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1331" target="_blank">00:22:11.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the market return, total return on the market, tracks the investment return. The investment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1336" target="_blank">00:22:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">return clearly drives the market return. And if you divide one into one, those little jiggles</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1344" target="_blank">00:22:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">amount to something much bigger. It's the same chart, just worked out a different way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1348" target="_blank">00:22:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, you can see the investment return go way high up in the tech boom, and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1353" target="_blank">00:22:33.080</a></span> | <span class="t">back to more or less a normal phase. That one would be the exact. It starts at one end</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1359" target="_blank">00:22:39.080</a></span> | <span class="t">at 1.1, and it probably will end at 1.0, somewhere along the line. So you can have a pretty good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1365" target="_blank">00:22:45.080</a></span> | <span class="t">handle on long-term returns from buying corporate business.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1370" target="_blank">00:22:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Now one thing I had never plotted before, however, was the investment return, and this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1375" target="_blank">00:22:55.080</a></span> | <span class="t">chart, and just plotted the speculative returns separately. And you can see the investment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1380" target="_blank">00:23:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">return grows, and grows at a rate of around 9% a year. The speculative return is up, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1387" target="_blank">00:23:07.080</a></span> | <span class="t">it's down, and it's zero. So it's all a business of capturing the returns earned by corporate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1394" target="_blank">00:23:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">America, and not worrying about the valuations placed on those earnings by Wall Street. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1400" target="_blank">00:23:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">it's quite a remarkable chart. It goes nowhere. If one goes nowhere, this is what one would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1405" target="_blank">00:23:25.080</a></span> | <span class="t">expect in 113 years, in terms of the addition and subtraction of speculative return. It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1412" target="_blank">00:23:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">business return that drives it. And that's central to my own investment policies and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1417" target="_blank">00:23:37.080</a></span> | <span class="t">theories. And so it's worth thinking about that. I'll be using that chart a little bit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1422" target="_blank">00:23:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">more, just to try and get things across to academics and others.

There's a trend</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1966" target="_blank">00:32:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">going on here.

It's going to be very hard for a lot of people. BlackRock has a terrible job because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=1977" target="_blank">00:32:57.080</a></span> | <span class="t">they have two masters.

And that poses the issue with great clarity. Because they can't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=2000" target="_blank">00:33:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">say, "Yeah, we charge more, but we're better managers." Because they're managing an index</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=2007" target="_blank">00:33:27.080</a></span> | <span class="t">fund.

But it all worked and had to be done in a short period of time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=2991" target="_blank">00:49:51.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we had municipal bond fund multi-tier maturity with a huge difference in the bond</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=2997" target="_blank">00:49:57.080</a></span> | <span class="t">industry. And tax-managed funds, first of them. And so on. It all came out in the end</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=3006" target="_blank">00:50:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">very well, as you can see.

It's set to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=3026" target="_blank">00:50:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">be published, I think. And I didn't take all of this into account. But you can see, one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=3034" target="_blank">00:50:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">reason it's all confusing is that some of the costs are borne by the investor himself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=3040" target="_blank">00:50:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Don't go through the fund books.

And investor</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=3068" target="_blank">00:51:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">behavior, no doubt, my overall matrix. I mentioned it in the books. People get the idea. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=3074" target="_blank">00:51:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">there you can see the index enhancement after 40 years.

And that data will be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=3084" target="_blank">00:51:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">in there. Although I don't extend it for those last three factors in there. So it's an analytical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=3090" target="_blank">00:51:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">article.

So that's part of the project that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=3106" target="_blank">00:51:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I should have mentioned earlier. Another project, books. What are we saying here? Oh. Well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=3113" target="_blank">00:51:53.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't have anything else to do. Someone asked me to write a forward to their book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=3117" target="_blank">00:51:57.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So I've written forwards to a book by John Wasik called "Cain's Way to Wealth." And I've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=3127" target="_blank">00:52:07.080</a></span> | <span class="t">been very interested in Cain since my days at Princeton.

So I was happy to write that. And these people expect about 500 words. And I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=3136" target="_blank">00:52:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">wrote about 5,000. But that seems to be OK. And then we have a biography of Paul Callum.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=3147" target="_blank">00:52:27.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And actually, it's arguable. It's State Street, in fact. It was the oldest mutual fund before</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=3153" target="_blank">00:52:33.080</a></span> | <span class="t">MIT. Because it started operations earlier than MIT. It's the Best Investors Trust. It</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=3159" target="_blank">00:52:39.080</a></span> | <span class="t">got incorporated later. So an informal thing has been given to MIT, the oldest mutual fund,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=3165" target="_blank">00:52:45.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the first mutual fund.

Much more fiduciary, much more pure than Boston. I'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=3179" target="_blank">00:52:59.080</a></span> | <span class="t">use the expression. But it is today. And this is also a theme of my big money in Boston</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=3185" target="_blank">00:53:05.080</a></span> | <span class="t">speech. It went from being fiduciaries, prudent, puritanical, Boston trustee, to being this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=3192" target="_blank">00:53:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">great big marketing business.

I don't have to be a Quaker. But it's what's Quakerism about. It's about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=3217" target="_blank">00:53:37.080</a></span> | <span class="t">simplicity. And it's about thrift. And I think we live up to that. So we are bringing the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=3226" target="_blank">00:53:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">business back to work again, at least I think I hope. Now, like everything I do, there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=3233" target="_blank">00:53:53.080</a></span> | <span class="t">probably a little overstatement here, a little hyperbole.

And I don't really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=3238" target="_blank">00:53:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">expect anybody else to, but I think one of us will. So now let's go to, oh my goodness,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5omwy_3Xs&t=3248" target="_blank">00:54:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">we have a lot of stuff here.
