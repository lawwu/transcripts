Riding the Paris subway couldn't be easier. Surprisingly less crowded than we were expecting. We thought Paris was gonna be wild and crazy and there were a lot of people there, but it never felt like there were a lot of people there.</p><p>- I think Paris does tourism so well already that accommodating the influx of people there for the Olympics just felt very natural. I think it's also a great city to just do walkabouts. So we were there for the Olympics, but even if you're there not for the Olympics, I think it's just a great city to just put on your shoes and get out there and explore by walking.</p><p>There's so many cool neighborhoods and bars and restaurants and all of that.</p></div></div></body></html>
