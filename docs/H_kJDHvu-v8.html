We're going to be exploring</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=4" target="_blank">00:00:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">two of the common methods that we can use to filter indexes in Vector Similarity Search.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=12" target="_blank">00:00:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we're also going to explore Pinecone's new solution to filtering in Vector Search.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=25" target="_blank">00:00:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, in Vector Similarity Search, what we do is build representations of data, so that could be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=35" target="_blank">00:00:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">text, images, or cooking recipes, and we convert them into vectors. We then store those vectors</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=45" target="_blank">00:00:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">in an index, and what we typically want to do is perform some kind of search or comparison of all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=52" target="_blank">00:00:52.560</a></span> | <span class="t">the vectors within that index. So, for example, if you found this video or article through Google or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=61" target="_blank">00:01:01.200</a></span> | <span class="t">YouTube, you will have typed something, some sort of query, into one of those search engines. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=70" target="_blank">00:01:10.080</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe something like, "How do I filter in Vector Similarity Search?" Then whichever search engine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">you use most likely converted your query into a vector representation, and then it took that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=88" target="_blank">00:01:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">vector representation and compared it to all of the other vectors in its vector index. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=97" target="_blank">00:01:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">those could be pages, videos, and so on. It could be anything, really. And out of all of those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">index vectors, it was this video or this article which seemed to be one of the most similar vectors</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">to your query vector. And so, you were served this video or this article near the top of your search,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">you clicked on it, and now here we are. In search and recommender systems,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">there's almost always a need to apply some sort of filter. On Google, we can search based on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">categories such as news or shopping. We can search by date. We can search by language or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">region. And likewise, Netflix, Amazon, Spotify might want to compare users in specific regions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So, restricting the search scope to relevant vectors is, in many cases, an absolute necessity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And despite the very clear need for filtering, there isn't a particularly good approach for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">doing so. So, let's start having a look at the different types of filters available to us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So, during the video, we'll be covering each one of those. We have pre-filtering, post-filtering,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and Pinecone's new single-stage filtering. Now, what I want to just do here is have a look at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">what metadata filtering actually is. So, when we have a vector index, each vector is going to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">assigned some sort of metadata. And that can be anything. It could be a number, a date, text.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It can really be anything that we can use to filter our search. And what we want to do is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">search where this or some condition is true. So, for example, say we have a big corporation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">they have all these different departments, and there are loads of internal documents within</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">that corporation. Some of those documents are assigned to the engineering department, some of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.640</a></span> | <span class="t">them are assigned to HR, and so on. A user in that company might want to go into their search,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and sometimes they may want to search across all departments, but sometimes they might want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">apply some sort of filter. So, they might want to say, "I want the top K documents where the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">department is equal to engineering," or, "I want the top K where the department is not HR."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we can apply anything in these metadata filters. So, we may want documents that are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">quite recent. So, what we might say is we want the top K documents where the date is greater than or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">equal to 14 days ago. And then we can sort of mix and match all of those different metadata filters</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">as well. Now, to implement a metadata filter, we need two things really. We need our vector index,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=302" target="_blank">00:05:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">which is what you can see at the top here, and we also need our metadata index. Now, each of these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.120</a></span> | <span class="t">will be paired one by one. So, each vector will have its own metadata record, and what we would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=319" target="_blank">00:05:19.520</a></span> | <span class="t">do is we'd apply a condition to our metadata index, and that would remove a few of these.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=328" target="_blank">00:05:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we'd get rid of these, and then based on what we have removed here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">we would also remove those equivalent vectors from our vector index. And that's how our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">filter would get applied. But there are different orders and different ways of doing this, as we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">will take a look at now. So, the first one of those is we could have a look at a post filter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=361" target="_blank">00:06:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So, a post filter is nothing more than we take our query vector, which is over here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and we also take our metadata query over here. Now, we start by performing a approximate search</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">between our query vector and all of our index vectors over here, and we get the top K matches</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">there. So, let's say we wanted maybe 10 of those. And then what we do is we then add in our metadata</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">query. So, we add that in over here, and that creates a filter for us. So, then we filter those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">remaining vectors through our new filter, and that leaves us with the filtered top K. Now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=415" target="_blank">00:06:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">in this case, top K is not going to be, usually is not going to be the number we asked for. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=420" target="_blank">00:07:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">say over here, we have 10 top K matches. Here, we filter some of those out, so we might end up with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=428" target="_blank">00:07:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">four. And then we also have pre-filtering. Now, pre-filtering, we change the order a little bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=434" target="_blank">00:07:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We apply our filter before we do the search. So, we have our metadata query over here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=441" target="_blank">00:07:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">We use that to create a filter over here. We then apply that to our full vector index over here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=451" target="_blank">00:07:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and that leaves us with so many of our vectors. And then what we do is we search based on that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=457" target="_blank">00:07:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">but because we are not searching through the full data sets, we can't do approximate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=464" target="_blank">00:07:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">nearest neighbor search. So, we have to do an exhaustive search at this point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=468" target="_blank">00:07:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, let's start with the pre-filter process. So, here, like we saw before, we start with our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=475" target="_blank">00:07:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">metadata index. We apply our filter to this, identifying which positions satisfy our filter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=483" target="_blank">00:08:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">condition, and then we use this filtered metadata index to filter out the vectors which do not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=491" target="_blank">00:08:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">satisfy our condition. And as we kind of saw before, this is where the issue with pre-filtering</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=499" target="_blank">00:08:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">comes in. Because we have just filtered out some of the vectors or many of the vectors in our index,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=506" target="_blank">00:08:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">we no longer have the same index as what we started with. And we need the full index to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=513" target="_blank">00:08:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">apply our approximate search on. But as soon as we filter, we change the structure of that index. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=521" target="_blank">00:08:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">we can no longer perform an approximate nearest neighbor search, which means we're just doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=526" target="_blank">00:08:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">a brute force, exhaustive k-nearest neighbor search. Now, if our index is very small or the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=535" target="_blank">00:08:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">number of vectors that we have output after our filter is very small, this is probably okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=544" target="_blank">00:09:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">But as soon as we start working with big data sets, this is not going to be very manageable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=551" target="_blank">00:09:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And the only other alternative that we have here is to build an index for every possible</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=560" target="_blank">00:09:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">filter outcome, which is not really an option because it's just simply not realistic to build</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=568" target="_blank">00:09:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">that many indexes. So, pre-filtering, we have good accuracy, but it's very slow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=576" target="_blank">00:09:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, post-filtering is, of course, slightly different. So, in this case, we start with our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=584" target="_blank">00:09:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">vector index. Now, we can perform our approximate nearest neighbor search because we have the full</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=590" target="_blank">00:09:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">index. We haven't filtered anything yet. And that returns the top k vectors that we want. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=597" target="_blank">00:09:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">say we want 10 vectors at this point. And then what we do is we find all the vectors</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=605" target="_blank">00:10:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">through our metadata index that satisfy whatever metadata condition we have set.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=610" target="_blank">00:10:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we apply the filter to those top k vectors, so 10 vectors maybe. And, of course,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=618" target="_blank">00:10:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">at this point, what we are doing is we're reducing the number of vectors that we get out. So, we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=623" target="_blank">00:10:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">don't actually get 10 vectors. We, for example, could get four vectors. And in the worst case</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=630" target="_blank">00:10:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">scenario, that filter could rule out all of the vectors that we've returned. And in the end, we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=636" target="_blank">00:10:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">return nothing, even when in the index there could be some relevant vectors, which is obviously not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=646" target="_blank">00:10:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">very ideal. We can try and eliminate this problem by just increasing k a lot. So, of course, if we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=654" target="_blank">00:10:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">use a low k value, the chances of all of them being excluded when we apply our filter post</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=662" target="_blank">00:11:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">search is reasonably high. But if we increase k up to 1 million, it's much lower. But the only</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=671" target="_blank">00:11:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">problem with that is that our search becomes very slow. And the more we increase k to eliminate the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=679" target="_blank">00:11:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">problem, the slower it gets. So, in this case, we have unreliable accuracy or performance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=686" target="_blank">00:11:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">But it is faster, unless we increase k. So, now let's introduce single-stage</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=694" target="_blank">00:11:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">filtering by Pinecone. Now, we are going to go through some code and test this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=700" target="_blank">00:11:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But first, I just want to introduce what it is at a high level. So, it's a new filter built by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=708" target="_blank">00:11:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Pinecone. And at a high level, it works by merging the vector and metadata indexes. And it allows us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=716" target="_blank">00:11:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">to filter and then do an approximate nearest neighbor search. So, what we get there is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=724" target="_blank">00:12:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">accuracy of pre-filtering. And at the same time, the search speed is often faster than post-filtering</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=732" target="_blank">00:12:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">as well. So, we really do get the best of both with this new filter. But let's go and actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=740" target="_blank">00:12:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">try it out. Okay. So, we're going to be using Pinecone here. And all I've done here is imported</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=749" target="_blank">00:12:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Pinecone, import JSON, and I've imported my data here. So, this data, I've already uploaded or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=758" target="_blank">00:12:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">asserted to my Pinecone client. And what it is, is just the squad data set in both English and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=769" target="_blank">00:12:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Italian. Now, in there, we have a few different items. So, we have the record ID, we have the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=780" target="_blank">00:13:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">text, although I've just sold this locally. We have the vector, which has been asserted to Pinecone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=788" target="_blank">00:13:08.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we also have the metadata, which is with Pinecone as well. Now, if we take a look at what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=793" target="_blank">00:13:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">we have in the metadata, we see that we have the language. So, we have either English or Italian.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=806" target="_blank">00:13:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we also have the topic. Now, what I want to do is just test the new filtering. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=814" target="_blank">00:13:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">we're going to be filtering based on language, topic. And we also have another metadata item here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=823" target="_blank">00:13:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">which I don't have locally, which is just a randomly generated date. So, we can have a look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=829" target="_blank">00:13:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">at using some of the greater than or equals to, less than equals to filters that we can use in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=837" target="_blank">00:13:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Pinecone. So, the first thing I'm going to do is initialize my connection to Pinecone. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=846" target="_blank">00:14:06.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I write pinecone.init. I need to pass my API key, which I've loaded above,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=853" target="_blank">00:14:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and also the environment that I am working in. Now, of course, this will be different and depend</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=864" target="_blank">00:14:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">on which environment you are using. So, I've initialized there, and what I can do is I can now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=874" target="_blank">00:14:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">create a direct connection to a specific index within my Pinecone environment. Now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=880" target="_blank">00:14:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to be connecting to one that I've already made, which is called squad test.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=887" target="_blank">00:14:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And now what I'll be able to do is use this index object to perform my queries.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=894" target="_blank">00:14:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we're going to be performing a vector search here. So, what we need first is a query vector</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=903" target="_blank">00:15:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">to perform our search with. Now, I use the sentence transformers library to encode the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=911" target="_blank">00:15:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">already indexed vectors. So, what we're going to do is use the same model to encode our query vector.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=921" target="_blank">00:15:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So, write sentence transformer, and that embedding model is sentence transformer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=930" target="_blank">00:15:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And I use the stsb xlm-r-multilingual model. So, I will need to download this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=950" target="_blank">00:15:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so that is downloading now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=953" target="_blank">00:15:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And then what we want to do is create our query vector. So, I'm going to assign it to xq,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=960" target="_blank">00:16:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and all I need to do is write embedder,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=964" target="_blank">00:16:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">adopt encode, and then I pass in the query that I would like to perform. So, in this case,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=977" target="_blank">00:16:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to search for context in our dataset, which mentions something along the lines of early</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=987" target="_blank">00:16:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">engineering courses provided by American universities in the 1870s. So, I will execute that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=995" target="_blank">00:16:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And note that we're using a multilingual model here. So, we should find that we will return</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1004" target="_blank">00:16:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">both English and Italian results, but both of them should be something similar to this topic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1013" target="_blank">00:16:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we will return our results. We just write index.query,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1019" target="_blank">00:16:59.600</a></span> | <span class="t">and what we can also do before we even do that is we'll just convert xq into the format that we need.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1032" target="_blank">00:17:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, like this. And then in here, we just pass xq, and I'll say that I want my top k value to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1040" target="_blank">00:17:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">three. Now, remember, if we were using post-filtering here, if we set top k value of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1050" target="_blank">00:17:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">three, we would probably return less than three. So, with post-filtering, we would want to set</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1055" target="_blank">00:17:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">something stupidly high here, just to get maybe three samples, if we're lucky.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1062" target="_blank">00:17:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But, as we're using single-stage filtering, we only need to set top k equal to three.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1068" target="_blank">00:17:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we'll execute that, and let's return the results.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1074" target="_blank">00:17:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And you see here that we get our IDs. So, we get this ID, one, two, and three.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1084" target="_blank">00:18:04.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So, what we now want to do is we want to map that back to the data that we have stored locally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1089" target="_blank">00:18:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">To do that, we're going to write IDs equals iid for i in the results. So, we're just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1099" target="_blank">00:18:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">getting these IDs here. So, we're going results. We need to enter into the results key.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1110" target="_blank">00:18:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">We want to access the first position in that list, and then, in there, we want to access the matches.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1118" target="_blank">00:18:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, from there, we'll print IDs, see what we get. Okay, we get those three</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1128" target="_blank">00:18:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">IDs. And now, what we want to do is use the data that I imported up here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1138" target="_blank">00:18:58.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Just here. And we're going to use that to print out whatever it is that these IDs are referring</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1147" target="_blank">00:19:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">to. Now, what we have in our data at the moment is a big list, which is not that useful. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1155" target="_blank">00:19:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">it would be more useful if we just reformat that into a dictionary. So, I'll do that quickly. We're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1162" target="_blank">00:19:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">just going to write getSample is equal to xid. And then, in here, we will store our context</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1174" target="_blank">00:19:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and metadata. So, context and metadata. We don't need to store the vector in here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1188" target="_blank">00:19:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">because we can't read that anyway. So, it's not that useful for us. Let me say, for x in data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1198" target="_blank">00:19:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so it's not context. Let me come up here and have a look at what we have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1212" target="_blank">00:20:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's text. Yeah, okay. So, let's change that to text here and here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1219" target="_blank">00:20:19.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so now we can do, for i in IDs, I want to get the sample. So, getSample i.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1235" target="_blank">00:20:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And we'll just print that out. So, we see here that the first one we get is Italian.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1246" target="_blank">00:20:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And the translation for this is something to do with the College of Engineering</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1253" target="_blank">00:20:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">was instituted in 1920. So, we have college, engineering, that's good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1260" target="_blank">00:21:00.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we also have something along the lines of the College of Science from the 1870s. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1267" target="_blank">00:21:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">generally, this looks pretty relevant, I think. And then, down here, we have, this is Italian</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1276" target="_blank">00:21:16.640</a></span> | <span class="t">again, but we also have the English translation of this here as well. So, we can see straight away,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1283" target="_blank">00:21:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">School of Engineering, Public Engineering School, founded 1891, and it offered engineering degrees</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1291" target="_blank">00:21:31.520</a></span> | <span class="t">as early as 1873. So, that's, again, pretty relevant. Now, I don't understand Italian.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1301" target="_blank">00:21:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, my first filter here would probably be, okay, I only want to return the English results.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1309" target="_blank">00:21:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So, let's go ahead and do that. So, I'm going to say results equals, and let's just copy what we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1316" target="_blank">00:21:56.640</a></span> | <span class="t">had up here. So, we're not repeating ourselves. We just want to take the index query. We can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1324" target="_blank">00:22:04.240</a></span> | <span class="t">include result. No, we don't need it. Let's just take that. And all we need to do now is add our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1335" target="_blank">00:22:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">filter. So, we just write filter. And then, in here, we want to write. So, we have our metadata,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1343" target="_blank">00:22:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and we have our language. And we want to say that this must be equal to, so we use EQEN,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1351" target="_blank">00:22:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">which is English. So, we get our results, and we're going to want to do the same thing again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1360" target="_blank">00:22:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we want to get our IDs, and we want to print those out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1370" target="_blank">00:22:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And there we go. So, now, we're just getting English results. Now, that was pretty fast. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1379" target="_blank">00:22:59.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I think what is quite useful is to see how fast those two searches were.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1386" target="_blank">00:23:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, obviously, we're getting pretty relevant results here, where, again, we're returning three</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1391" target="_blank">00:23:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">results, even with our filter applied. So, that's good. So, it seems like we're getting the accuracy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1399" target="_blank">00:23:19.360</a></span> | <span class="t">of pre-filtering here. And let's have a look at the speed difference between the two approaches.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1407" target="_blank">00:23:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, we shouldn't see anything particularly major, because this is a very small index. We only have,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1413" target="_blank">00:23:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I think, 40,000 vectors here. So, we won't see anything significant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1420" target="_blank">00:23:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But at least we can check that we're not getting anything slow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1426" target="_blank">00:23:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So, let's have a look. And you see here that we're actually getting a slightly faster response</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1442" target="_blank">00:24:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">when we filter. And this is typical with Pinecone single-stage filtering. When we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1449" target="_blank">00:24:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">add a filter, usually, we'll actually get faster results, which is pretty insane. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1456" target="_blank">00:24:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">not only are we getting good speed, like post-filtering, but we're actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1461" target="_blank">00:24:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">making our search faster by adding a filter, which is neither post-filtering nor pre-filtering can do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1470" target="_blank">00:24:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">that. And again, at the same time, we're still getting that accuracy of pre-filtering. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1475" target="_blank">00:24:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">this is, in my opinion, pretty impressive. Now, we might also want to add another filter. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1486" target="_blank">00:24:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">at the moment, we're just adding one filter, which is fine. It works. But let's say I look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1494" target="_blank">00:24:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">at my results. And I know this is hard to read. But in here, we have the topic. We have University</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1500" target="_blank">00:25:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">of Kansas. OK, fine. Maybe I'm not interested in the University of Kansas. So, how about here?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1506" target="_blank">00:25:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">We have University of Notre Dame. Let's say I'm not even interested in these guys either.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1510" target="_blank">00:25:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Institute of Technology, let's say, OK, yeah, we can keep them. That's fine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1516" target="_blank">00:25:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I want to say, OK, I want everything that is one, in English, and two,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1522" target="_blank">00:25:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">not from the University of Kansas and not from the University of Notre Dame. So, to do that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1530" target="_blank">00:25:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I need to add another condition to my filter. So, to do that, all I need to do is say topic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1541" target="_blank">00:25:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">is not in this time. So, we're going to say not in. And then we pass a list here. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1548" target="_blank">00:25:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">a list of what we don't want to see, which was the University of Notre Dame</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1557" target="_blank">00:25:57.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and also the University of Kansas. OK, so let's add those two. And let's see what we get.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1570" target="_blank">00:26:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So, again, it seemed pretty fast. And we're getting University of Kansas here. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1575" target="_blank">00:26:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">that must mean that I have written something wrong. So, I think here, the topic filter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1586" target="_blank">00:26:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">in my pine cone index is actually maybe called title. Let's see. And this is also wrong. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1595" target="_blank">00:26:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">let's correct that. OK, so now we're getting something different. So, yes, this should be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1605" target="_blank">00:26:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">title in reality. So, Institute of Technology. Institute of Technology. And where is our other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1613" target="_blank">00:26:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">one? Institute of Technology here. Now, we're not returning University of Kansas and we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1618" target="_blank">00:26:58.560</a></span> | <span class="t">not returning University of Notre Dame, which is what we wanted. Now, there was also the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1625" target="_blank">00:27:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">date filter that I wanted to show you as well. So, we don't only need to filter based on strings,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1632" target="_blank">00:27:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">we can also filter based on numeric data times. And for me to show you this, I think it's best</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1640" target="_blank">00:27:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">if we ... It would also be better if we include our metadata here as well. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1649" target="_blank">00:27:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">we can just see it directly from our results. So, we know that we're returning relevant text.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1656" target="_blank">00:27:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, now let's just have a look at the metadata. So, I'm going to include metadata there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1667" target="_blank">00:27:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's just see what we get. So, we see now that we actually include the metadata in our results,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1675" target="_blank">00:27:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">which is also pretty cool. Now, we have a date, which is just a numeric value here. It's just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1682" target="_blank">00:28:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">something very simple. It just randomly generates. There's no actual relation between the date and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1688" target="_blank">00:28:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">this record. It's completely random. And we can see, okay, we have a date from 2016, 2008,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1698" target="_blank">00:28:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and we also have 2020 here as well. Now, the first thing that I might want to do is say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1704" target="_blank">00:28:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">okay, I want to return only the more recent date. So, let's say, okay, we add, we keep all of that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1713" target="_blank">00:28:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">all the other filters in there. And we might say, okay, but we also want date</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1721" target="_blank">00:28:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">to be greater than or equal to, let's say, what do we have here? We have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1734" target="_blank">00:28:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">what is the most recent. So, we have this 2021. Let's say we want to go for ones that are,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1741" target="_blank">00:29:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">let's say, 2018 onwards for now. So, 2018, 001. Okay. So, the very first day of 2018.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1753" target="_blank">00:29:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's search and see what we get. And we can see, yep, it's definitely filtering correctly there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1762" target="_blank">00:29:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, let's have a look at what the search time is for that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1765" target="_blank">00:29:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So, adding quite a few filter conditions here. So, let's just see what we get.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1776" target="_blank">00:29:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">We should also exclude that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1780" target="_blank">00:29:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And you see, it's actually slightly faster again, which is, again, it's pretty cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1791" target="_blank">00:29:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">But like I said, it's a small data set. When we do this on bigger data sets, the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1797" target="_blank">00:29:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">difference can be huge. Now, what we can also do is we can actually add another condition</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1805" target="_blank">00:30:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">within our date here. So, we can say, okay, we want it to be greater than or equals to 2018.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1812" target="_blank">00:30:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But let's say we want to search for records only in 2018. So, we might also say, okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1819" target="_blank">00:30:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">we want it to be greater than 2018, or the first day of 2018. We also want it to be less than or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1826" target="_blank">00:30:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">equal to the very last day in 2018. So, 2018, 12/31. And we will filter. And we see that now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1839" target="_blank">00:30:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">we're only returning records from 2018. So, again, super cool, and I think an incredibly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1849" target="_blank">00:30:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">useful functionality for vector similarity search. Now, we were just using a very small data set</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1859" target="_blank">00:30:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">there. So, I couldn't really show you how impressive the speedup can be when we're applying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1866" target="_blank">00:31:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">filters. But I do have this other index. Now, I'm not going to go through just coding everything,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1872" target="_blank">00:31:12.720</a></span> | <span class="t">because it's pretty straightforward. We have an index here, which is 1.2 million vectors,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1881" target="_blank">00:31:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and it has a single metadata field in there, which I've called Tag1. And that's just a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1887" target="_blank">00:31:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">randomly generated number or integer from 0 to 100. So, we, of course, initialize the connection</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1896" target="_blank">00:31:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">to our index in the first cell up here. And then over here, I'm just creating a random query vector.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1907" target="_blank">00:31:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So, first, this here is our unfiltered search. So, we get this 79.2 milliseconds. Now, again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1917" target="_blank">00:31:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">most of this is network latency, rather than the search time in the actual index.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1925" target="_blank">00:32:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But we will see the search time decrease pretty dramatically here. So, first, we'll say, okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1931" target="_blank">00:32:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">we want Tag1 to be greater than 30. So, we're going from 0 to 100. So, we're roughly removing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1939" target="_blank">00:32:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">probably about 30% of the vectors from our search. And we can see, okay, we just shaved off</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1946" target="_blank">00:32:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">8 milliseconds, which is impressive. And then we take that even further. So, we say, okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1953" target="_blank">00:32:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">we want it greater than 70. So, now, we're shaving off around 70% of our vectors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1958" target="_blank">00:32:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And our search time goes down to 56.6 milliseconds. Do it even further. So, about 90% here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1967" target="_blank">00:32:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">we go down to 54 milliseconds. And then here, I'm using the equals sign here. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1973" target="_blank">00:32:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm only searching for about 1% of the index. And it goes down to 51.6 milliseconds. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1982" target="_blank">00:33:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">incredibly impressive speed up there. And this is kind of what it looks like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1988" target="_blank">00:33:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we have the Tag1 GT value or greater than value on the left. And as we increase that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=1998" target="_blank">00:33:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">up this way, our time, our search time in milliseconds goes down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=2006" target="_blank">00:33:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, it is a little bit bumpy. It goes up and down a lot. I've tried to showcase that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=2013" target="_blank">00:33:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">In this graph. But the trend is quite clearly downwards. So, the more we filter, the faster</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=2022" target="_blank">00:33:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">our search, which is incredible. Now, that's it for this video covering pre-filtering,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=2030" target="_blank">00:33:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">post-filtering, and Pinecone's new single stage filtering. I hope this has been useful and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=2037" target="_blank">00:33:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">insightful. If you are interested in testing Pinecone out yourself, there is a link to Pinecone's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=2045" target="_blank">00:34:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">website in the description. But we'll leave it there for now. Thank you very much for watching.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_kJDHvu-v8&t=2051" target="_blank">00:34:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'll see you in the next one.</span></div></div></body></html>
