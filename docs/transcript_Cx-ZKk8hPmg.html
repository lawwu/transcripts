Well, in 2020, the defund the police movement gained a lot of momentum. And in early 2021, YouGov ran a survey and found that overall, Americans were very much against defunding the police. But when they broke down the results by income category, they found that the highest income Americans were by far the most supportive of defunding the police.</p><p>There was another survey of just Democratic voters and found that white Democrats were far more supportive of defunding the police than black and Hispanic Democrats. And so as a result, despite the fact that most people didn't want this, many cities across the US subsequently reduced spending for police departments.</p><p>And this has contributed to the violent crime wave that we've seen over the last couple of years. So in the US, relative to those earning $75,000 or more per year, the poorest Americans are seven times more likely to be victims of robbery, seven times more likely to be victims of aggravated assault, and 20 times more likely to be victims of sexual assault.</p><p>It's important here to understand that to not stop crime is to actually victimize the poor. This is a luxury belief. you</p></div></div></body></html>
