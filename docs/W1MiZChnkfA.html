So yeah, our talk is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=48" target="_blank">00:00:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">about, oh, one sec. Maybe we should have used the other clicker. Yeah, yeah. All right. That's okay. We'll use the laptop. So we're going to talk</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=58" target="_blank">00:00:58.240</a></span> | <span class="t">about some of the tough RAG problems in the legal frontier, sort of challenges, some solutions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=63" target="_blank">00:01:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and learnings from our experiences working together on it. So we'll start roughly with like sort of how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=67" target="_blank">00:01:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Harvey tackles retrieval, the types of problems there are, and then the challenges that come up with that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=71" target="_blank">00:01:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">all with like retrieval quality, scaling, security, all that good stuff, and then how we end up sort</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=76" target="_blank">00:01:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">of creating a system with good infrastructure to support that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So first of all, a quick intro to what Harvey is. We're a legal AI assistant. So we sell our sort of AI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=89" target="_blank">00:01:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">product to a bunch of law firms to help them do all kinds of legal tasks like draft, analyze documents,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=96" target="_blank">00:01:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of go through legal workflows. And a big part of that is processing data. So we handle data of all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=101" target="_blank">00:01:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">different sort of volumes and forms. The sort of different scales of that are, we have an assistant</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">product that's like on demand uploads, same way you might like on demand upload to any AI assistant tool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=111" target="_blank">00:01:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's like a smaller one to 50 range. We have these vaults, which are sort of larger scale project</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=117" target="_blank">00:01:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">contacts. So if there's like a big deal going on that the law firm's working on, or like a data room,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">where they need sort of all their contracts, all their, you know, litigation documents and emails in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">one place, that's a vault. And then the third is the largest scale, which is data corpuses,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">which are like knowledge bases around the world. So like legislation, case laws of a particular country,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.040</a></span> | <span class="t">all the sort of laws, taxes, regulations that go into it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=138" target="_blank">00:02:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So yeah, some big challenges that come up, come with that. One is scale, just very large amounts of data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Some of these documents are like super long and dense and packed with content.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Sparse versus dense, I'm sure it's like a sort of retrieval challenge that all of you deal with,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">of how to represent the data, how to retrieve over and index it. Query complexity is a big one. We got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">very sort of difficult expert queries. And I'll show an example of that in the next slide.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">The data is very domain specific and complex. There's sort of a lot of nitty gritty legal details</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that go into it. So we have to like work with domain experts and lawyers to understand it and try</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.160</a></span> | <span class="t">to like translate that into how we represent the data, how we, you know, index, query, pre-process over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">it. Data security and privacy is a big one. A lot of this data is sensitive for like confidential deals</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">or confidential, I don't know, IPOs, financial filing, stuff like that. So we have to respect all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that for our clients. And then of course, evaluation of how to make sure systems are actually good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So yeah, I'll show a quick demonstration of a retrieval quality challenge. So this is just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.720</a></span> | <span class="t">on the query side of like, this is maybe the average complexity of a query someone might issue in our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">product. They're much more complex and maybe simpler ones, but this is right in the middle. And you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">see that like, there's a lot of different components that go into this. There's sort of a semantic, well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">to read it out, it's like, what is the applicable regime to covered bonds issued before</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">9 July 2022 under the directive EU 2019-2062 and article 129 of the CRR. So, you know, that's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">handful. What goes into it is like, there's a semantic aspect. There's sort of implicit filtering going on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.240</a></span> | <span class="t">of like, you know, we want applicability before a certain date. There's a specialized data set being</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">referenced, which is EU laws and directives. There's kind of keyword matches of like the specific, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">regulation directive ID. It is multi-part in that it's sort of asking how this applies to two different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">regulations, like one directive, one article. And there's like domain jargon here, or this is like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">an abbreviation. I forget what it was, capital regulations something. I looked it up this morning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">But yeah, it's very complex. And we sort of need a system that can tackle all this complexity and sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">break down this query and use all the appropriate technologies for the different parts of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And yeah, so one common question we get sort of in response to this complexity is, how do you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">evaluate your systems? How do you make sure they're good? And that's actually where we spend a ton of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">time. It's, you know, not as much on the algorithms and the fancy egetic techniques, but more like how to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">validate them. And I'd say like investing in eval driven development is a huge, huge key to building</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">these systems and making sure they're good, especially when it's a tough domain that like you don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=305" target="_blank">00:05:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">inherently know much about as maybe an engineer or researcher. So I say there's no silver bullet eval,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">but we have like a whole range of them of like different task depths and complexities. So in sort</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">of one dimension, you have it being sort of higher fidelity, the more costly. And then the other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">direction, it's like more automated evals that are faster to iterate on. So as an example, like the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of high fidelity would be like expert reviews of just having them directly review outputs and analyze</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">them and write reports. So that's like super expensive, but super high quality. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe something between is like an expert labeled like set of criteria that you can maybe evaluate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">synthetically or evaluate in some automated way. So it's still expensive to curate, maybe a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">expensive to run, but more, more tractable. And then the third is sort of the fastest iteration,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">which is sort of more automated quantitative metrics like just, you know, retrieval precision recall,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=358" target="_blank">00:05:58.560</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of different, more deterministic success criteria of like, am I pulling documents from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the right folder? Is it the right section? Do they have the right keywords in them? Things like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=367" target="_blank">00:06:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And yeah, give you a quick sense also of sort of the scale and complexity on the data side,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">not only on the query side. So the data sets we integrate with are pretty massive. As you can see,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=382" target="_blank">00:06:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">we support like, you know, data sets across all different kinds of countries. And for each one,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=387" target="_blank">00:06:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">there's sort of complex filtering and organization and categorization that goes into it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=391" target="_blank">00:06:31.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So we sort of work with domain experts for all of this, but also try to apply automation whenever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">possible, like use their guidance to maybe come up with heuristics or LLM processing techniques</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=402" target="_blank">00:06:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">to be able to categorize all of this. And I'd say that the performance implications are pretty significant</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=409" target="_blank">00:06:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">as well. We need very good performance both online and offline. Online being like querying over this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=416" target="_blank">00:06:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you want good latency, and then offline being like ingestion, re-ingestion, running ML experiments for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=421" target="_blank">00:07:01.040</a></span> | <span class="t">different variations and such. And I'd say generally one of these corpuses can be like, yeah, tens of millions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=426" target="_blank">00:07:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">of docks. So yeah, pretty large scale. And each document is often quite large.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=431" target="_blank">00:07:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So I can talk quickly about kind of infrastructure needs to support this. So at this scale, of course,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=442" target="_blank">00:07:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">we, you know, we want infrastructure to be reliable, available for all our users at all times. I'm sure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=449" target="_blank">00:07:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">that's something that, you know, all products need. We also want smooth sort of onboarding and scaling,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=455" target="_blank">00:07:35.920</a></span> | <span class="t">where, you know, we definitely want our ML and data teams to be able to focus more on the sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=461" target="_blank">00:07:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the business logic and the quality and spinning up new applications and products for customers and,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=466" target="_blank">00:07:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, not too much about like the nitty-gritty details of the database or tuning that or manually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=472" target="_blank">00:07:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">scaling.

And then, of course, any sort of vector or or keyword or any</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=508" target="_blank">00:08:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">filtering database we need, we want to support good performance, query flexibility, scale, especially</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=514" target="_blank">00:08:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">for all the different kinds of query patterns I mentioned before, where it's like, you need exact</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=518" target="_blank">00:08:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">matches, you want semantic matches, you want filters, you might want sort of to sort of navigate it, maybe,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=524" target="_blank">00:08:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah, agentically or like in some dynamic way. So yeah, all that flexibility is important to us at scale.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=532" target="_blank">00:08:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's where LanceTV comes in. Cool. Thank you. Awesome. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=539" target="_blank">00:08:59.600</a></span> | <span class="t">sorry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=545" target="_blank">00:09:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. I'm going to try to hold this here, maybe. So there's no echo. Okay. Yeah. So as I was saying,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=555" target="_blank">00:09:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and so, you know, I work at LanceTV. And what we are delivering for AI is beyond what I call just a vector</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=566" target="_blank">00:09:26.720</a></span> | <span class="t">database, but what we call an AI native multimodal lake house. And so if you think about back to maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=573" target="_blank">00:09:33.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Jerry's talk, right, in addition to search, you also need a good foundation, a good platform for you to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=581" target="_blank">00:09:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">all of the other tasks that you need to do with your AI data. So this can be feature extraction,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=587" target="_blank">00:09:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">generating summaries, generating text descriptions from images, managing all that data. And you want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=595" target="_blank">00:09:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">to be able to do that all together. So what you really need is sort of this lake house architecture,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=600" target="_blank">00:10:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">where all the data can be stored in one place on object store. You can run search and retrieval</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=608" target="_blank">00:10:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">workloads. You can run analytical workloads. You can train off of that data. And of course,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=613" target="_blank">00:10:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">you can pre-process that data to iterate on new features that you can experiment for your applications</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=618" target="_blank">00:10:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and models. Specifically, too, in addition to these large batch offline use cases,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=628" target="_blank">00:10:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, lake house architectures generally are good for that, but not necessarily for online serving.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=634" target="_blank">00:10:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is where LanceTV distributed architecture comes in. And it's actually good for both offline and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=643" target="_blank">00:10:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">online context so that we can serve at massive scale from cloud object store. We can deliver</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=650" target="_blank">00:10:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">compute memory and storage separation. And we give you a simple API for sophisticated retrieval, whether</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=658" target="_blank">00:10:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you want to combine multiple vector columns, vector and full text search, and then do re-ranking on top of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=666" target="_blank">00:11:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">that. Those are all available with an API in Python or TypeScript that feels what folks have told me feels</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=676" target="_blank">00:11:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of like pandas or polar, like very familiar to data workers who are used to data frame type of APIs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=684" target="_blank">00:11:24.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And of course, for large tables, we support GPU indexing. So I think our record has been around something like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=692" target="_blank">00:11:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">three or four billion vectors in a single table that can be indexed in under two or three hours.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=700" target="_blank">00:11:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So all of that is to say, like, LanceTV excels at massive scale. And this is happening at a fraction of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=710" target="_blank">00:11:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">the cost because of the compute storage separation and because we take advantage of object store. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=719" target="_blank">00:11:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">so of course, and I talked about sort of having one place to put all of your AI data. So this is the only</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=726" target="_blank">00:12:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">database where you can put, you know, images and videos and audio track next to your embeddings,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=733" target="_blank">00:12:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">next to text data, next to your tabular data, time series data. You can put all of that in a single table.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=743" target="_blank">00:12:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you can, of course, use that as the single source of truth for all the different workloads</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=747" target="_blank">00:12:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that you want to do that do on that data from search to analytics to training and, of course,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=752" target="_blank">00:12:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">pre-processing or feature engineering. A lot of that is possible because of the open source</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=760" target="_blank">00:12:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">LANs format that we built from the ground up. So, you know, if you're working with multimodal data,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=766" target="_blank">00:12:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">whether it's documents, you know, PDF scan slides or just large, even large-scale videos,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=772" target="_blank">00:12:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">if you're doing that in, let's say, like Web Dataset or Iceberg Parquet, you're missing out on a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=780" target="_blank">00:13:00.240</a></span> | <span class="t">features and things like, you know, lack of random access or the inability to support large blob data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=788" target="_blank">00:13:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">or not being very efficient about schema evolution. So LANs format, by giving you all of those,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=797" target="_blank">00:13:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">right, it makes it so that you can store all of your data in one place rather than split up across</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=804" target="_blank">00:13:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">multiple parts. And so this is the, I would say, like the foundational innovation in LANs CB where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=813" target="_blank">00:13:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">without it, what we see a lot of AI teams doing is they have to have different copies of different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=818" target="_blank">00:13:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">parts of their data in different places, and they're spending a lot of their time and effort</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=822" target="_blank">00:13:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">just sort of keeping those pieces glued together and in sync with each other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=827" target="_blank">00:13:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. So, kind of, basically, you can think about LANs format as sort of parquet plus iceberg plus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=839" target="_blank">00:13:59.120</a></span> | <span class="t">secondary indices, but for AI data. And that gives you fast random access, which is good for search and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=845" target="_blank">00:14:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">shuffle. It still gives you fast scans, which is so good for analytics and, you know, data loading and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=851" target="_blank">00:14:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">training. And it's the only one out of this set that is uniquely good for storing blob data, or more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=859" target="_blank">00:14:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">importantly, a mix of large blob data and small, like scalar data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=865" target="_blank">00:14:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And by using Apache Arrow as the main interface, LANs format is already compatible with your current</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=874" target="_blank">00:14:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">data lake and lake house tools. So you can use Spark and Ray to write very large amounts of LANs data in a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=882" target="_blank">00:14:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">distributed fashion very quickly. You can use PyTorch to load that data for training or fine tuning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=889" target="_blank">00:14:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You can certainly query it using tools like, you know, pandas and pollers. All right. So I want you to take it back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=898" target="_blank">00:14:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so we're back? Okay. So I just wanted to share some general take home messages about building RAG for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=909" target="_blank">00:15:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">these sort of large scale domain specific use cases. So the first is that these domain specific challenges</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=914" target="_blank">00:15:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">require very creative solutions around understanding the data and also choosing sort of modeling and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=919" target="_blank">00:15:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">infrastructure around that. Like I mentioned about like trying to understand the structure of your data, what the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=923" target="_blank">00:15:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">use cases are, what the explicit and implicit query patterns are. So definitely spend time with that. Work with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=929" target="_blank">00:15:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">domain experts and try to sort of immerse yourself as much as possible in that. The second is to make sure you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=936" target="_blank">00:15:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">building for iteration speed and flexibility. I think this is a very new technology, very new industry, and a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=941" target="_blank">00:15:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">things are changing. New tools are coming out, new paradigms, new model context windows and everything. So you kind of want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=947" target="_blank">00:15:47.120</a></span> | <span class="t">set yourself up for flexibility and iteration speed. And you can kind of ground that in evaluation, where if you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=954" target="_blank">00:15:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">good evaluation sets or either procedures or automation around that, then you can iterate much faster and just get good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=959" target="_blank">00:15:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">signal on whether your systems are good or accurate. So definitely invest time in the evaluation to enable that iteration speed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=966" target="_blank">00:16:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, yeah, the third, which John covered is that new data infrastructure has to recognize that there's sort of this new world we're entering</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=974" target="_blank">00:16:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">with multimodal data, a lot heavier on vectors and embeddings. Workloads are very diverse and the scale is just going to keep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=981" target="_blank">00:16:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">getting larger and larger as we try to sort of ingest and query over all the data that exists, public and private.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=991" target="_blank">00:16:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, thanks for listening to our talk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1MiZChnkfA&t=993" target="_blank">00:16:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you for listening to our talk.</span></div></div></body></html>
