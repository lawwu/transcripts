Your first large-scale program, you wrote it in IBM 650 Assembler in the summer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=53" target="_blank">00:00:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">of 1957? I wrote it in decimal machine language. I didn't know about Assembler until a year later.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=60" target="_blank">00:01:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But the year, 1957, and the program is Tic-Tac-Toe. Yeah, and I learned about Assembler later that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=67" target="_blank">00:01:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">summer. I probably did. In 1957, hardly anybody had heard of Assembler. You looked at the user</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=71" target="_blank">00:01:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">manuals. How would you write a program for this machine? It would say 69, which meant load the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=81" target="_blank">00:01:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">distributor, and then you would give the address of the number you wanted to load into the distributor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=86" target="_blank">00:01:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Yesterday, my friend Doug Spicer at the Computer History Museum sent me a link to something that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">just went on YouTube. It was IBM's progress report from 1956, which is very contemporary with 1957.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And in 1956, IBM had donated to Stanford University an IBM 650, one of the first ones,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.720</a></span> | <span class="t">when they showed a picture of the assembly line for IBM 650s. And they said, "This is number 500</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=118" target="_blank">00:01:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">or something coming off the assembly line." And I had never seen so many IBM 650s. I did in this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">movie that's on YouTube now. And it showed the picture from Stanford. They said, "Look, we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=138" target="_blank">00:02:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">donated one of these to Stanford, one to MIT," and they mentioned one other college. And in December</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">of '56, they donated to my university, K-STEC. But anyway, they showed a picture then of a class</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">session where a guy was teaching programming. And on the blackboard, it said 69, 8,000. I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">he was teaching them how to write code for this IBM 650, which was in decimal numbers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So the instructions were 10 decimal digits. You had two digits that said what to do, four digits</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to say what to do it to, and four more digits to say where to get your next instruction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's a manual that describes what each of the numbers mean.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And the manual was actually... If the manual had been well-written, I probably never would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">have gone into computer science, but it was so badly written, I figured that I must have a talent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.280</a></span> | <span class="t">for it because I'm only a freshman and I could write a better manual. And-</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what you did.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I started working at the computer center and wrote some manuals then. But yeah, but this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">was the way we did it. And my first program then was June of 1957.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">The Tic-Tac-Toe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">No, that was the second program. The first program was factoring a number.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you dial a number on the switches. I mean, you sat at this big mainframe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and you turn the dials, set a number, and then it would punch out the factors of that number on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">cards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's the input is the number?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">The input was, yeah, the input was a number, a 10-digit number, and the output was its factors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And I wrote that program. I still have a copy of it somewhere.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">How many lines of code? Do you remember?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, yeah, it started out as about 20, but then I kept having to debug it. And I discovered</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">debugging, of course, when I wrote my first program.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">What does debugging look like on a program with just all numbers?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, you sit there and you... I don't remember how I got it into the machine,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">but I think there was a way to punch it on cards. So each instruction would be one card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe I could get seven instructions on a card, eight instructions, I don't know. But anyway,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">so I'm sitting there at the console of the machine. I mean, I'm doing this at night when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">nobody else is around.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Of course.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you have one set of switches where you dial the number I'm inputting, but there's another</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">switch that says, "Okay, now execute one instruction and show me what you did." Or there were another</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">four switches I'd say, "Stop if you get to that instruction." So I could say, "Now go until you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=333" target="_blank">00:05:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">get there again and watch." Okay, so I could watch. It would take that number and it would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">divide it by two. And if there's no remainder, then okay, two is a factor. So then I work on...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But if not divisible by two, divide by three. Okay, keep trying until you know you're at the end.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And you would find a bug if you were just surprised that something weird happened?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=361" target="_blank">00:06:01.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, certainly. I mean, first of all, I might have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">tried to divide by one instead of two. You're off by one error, as people make all the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=372" target="_blank">00:06:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But maybe I go to the wrong instruction. Maybe I left something in a register that I shouldn't have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=379" target="_blank">00:06:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">done. But the first bugs were pretty... Probably on the first night, I was able to get the factors</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=387" target="_blank">00:06:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">of 30 as equal to two, three, and five. Okay? Sorry to interrupt. So you're sitting there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">late at night.

So what's that like? So most of the world is sleeping,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and you have to be there at night because that's when you get access to the computer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=411" target="_blank">00:06:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Between my freshman and sophomore year, I didn't need sleep. I used to do all nighters.

I would just stay</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=425" target="_blank">00:07:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">up all night, and it would be done on Tuesday morning. I didn't get ulcers and stuff like that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=434" target="_blank">00:07:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">until later.

So I wrote</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=497" target="_blank">00:08:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">almost the entire manual for tech during downtime of that machine.

The kind of things we remember that stick</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=533" target="_blank">00:08:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">in our memory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=534" target="_blank">00:08:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, okay. Yeah. Well, I could tell you a bunch of Rodbrook stories too, but let's go back to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=540" target="_blank">00:09:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">650. So I'm debugging my first program and I had more bugs in it than number of lines of code. I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=553" target="_blank">00:09:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">mean, the number of lines of code kept growing. And let me explain. So I had to punch the answers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=558" target="_blank">00:09:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">on cards. So suppose I'm factoring the number 30, then I got to put two somewhere on the card. I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=569" target="_blank">00:09:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">got to put a three somewhere on the card. I got to put a five somewhere on the card. And you know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=574" target="_blank">00:09:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">what? It was my first program. I probably screwed up and it fell off the edge of the card or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=581" target="_blank">00:09:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">something like that. But I didn't realize that there are some tensioned numbers that have more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=588" target="_blank">00:09:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">than eight factors. And the card has only 80 columns. And so I need 10 columns for every</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=594" target="_blank">00:09:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">factor. So my first program didn't take account for the fact that I would have to punch more than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=599" target="_blank">00:09:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">one card. My first program just lined the stuff up in memory and then I punched the card. So by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=606" target="_blank">00:10:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the time I finished, I had to deal with lots of things. Also, if you put a large prime number in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=616" target="_blank">00:10:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">there, my program might have sat there for 10 minutes. The 650 was pretty slow. And so it would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=622" target="_blank">00:10:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">sit there spinning its wheels and you wouldn't know if it was in a loop or whatever. You said</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=626" target="_blank">00:10:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">10 digit is the input? 10 digits, yeah. So I think the largest is sort of 9999999997 or something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=634" target="_blank">00:10:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">like that. That would take me a while for that first one. Anyway, that was my first program.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=640" target="_blank">00:10:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, what was your goal with that program? Was there something you were hoping to find a large</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=646" target="_blank">00:10:46.560</a></span> | <span class="t">prime maybe or the opposite? No, my goal was to see the lights flashing and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=651" target="_blank">00:10:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">understand how this magical machine would be able to do something that took so long by hand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=658" target="_blank">00:10:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So what was your second program?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=659" target="_blank">00:10:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">My second program was a converted number from binary to decimal or something like that. It was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=669" target="_blank">00:11:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">much simpler. It didn't have that many bugs in it. My third program was Tic-Tac-Toe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=674" target="_blank">00:11:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. And it had some machines. So the Tic-Tac-Toe program is interesting on many levels,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=680" target="_blank">00:11:20.560</a></span> | <span class="t">but one of them is that it had some, you can call machine learning in it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=685" target="_blank">00:11:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">That's, yeah, that's right. I don't know how long it's going to be before the name of our field has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=694" target="_blank">00:11:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">changed from computer science to machine learning. But anyway, it was my first experience with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=702" target="_blank">00:11:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">machine learning. Okay, so here we had... Yeah. How does the program... Well, first of all,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=706" target="_blank">00:11:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">what is the problem you were solving? What is Tic-Tac-Toe? What are we talking about? And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=715" target="_blank">00:11:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">how is it designed? Right. So you've got a three by three grid and each can be in three states. It</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=724" target="_blank">00:12:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">can be empty or it can have an X or an O. Yeah. All right. So three to the ninth is a... Well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=732" target="_blank">00:12:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">what is... How big is it? I should know. But it's 81 times 81 times three. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=741" target="_blank">00:12:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">anyway, eight is like two to the third. So that would be like two to the sixth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=751" target="_blank">00:12:31.120</a></span> | <span class="t">But that'd be 64. Then you have to... Anyway. I love how you're doing the calculation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=758" target="_blank">00:12:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Anyway, the three comes from the fact that it's either empty, an X or an O. Right. And the 650</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=769" target="_blank">00:12:49.360</a></span> | <span class="t">was a machine that had only 2,010 digit words. You go from 0,0,0,0 to 1,9,9,9 and that's it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=782" target="_blank">00:13:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And each word, you have a 10 digit number. So that's not many bits. I mean, I got to have...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=790" target="_blank">00:13:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">In order to have a memory of every position I've seen, I need three to the ninth bits.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=798" target="_blank">00:13:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. But it was a decimal machine too. It didn't have bits. But it did have strange instruction</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=805" target="_blank">00:13:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">where if you had a 10 digit number, but all the digits were either eight or nine,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=810" target="_blank">00:13:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">you'd be 89988 or something like that. You could make a test whether it was eight or nine. That</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=820" target="_blank">00:13:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">was one of the strange things IBM engineers put into the machine. I have no idea why.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=825" target="_blank">00:13:45.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, hardly ever used. But anyway, I needed one digit for every position I'd seen. Zero meant it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=834" target="_blank">00:13:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">was a bad position. Nine meant it was a good position. I think I started out at five or six.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=841" target="_blank">00:14:01.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you win a game, then you increase the value of that position for you, but you decrease it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=850" target="_blank">00:14:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">for your opponent. But I had that much total memory for every possible position was one digit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=861" target="_blank">00:14:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And I had a total of 20,000 digits, which had to also include my program and all the logic and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=868" target="_blank">00:14:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">everything, including how to ask the user what the moves are and things like this. Okay. So I think I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=876" target="_blank">00:14:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">had to work it out. Every position in tic-tac-toe is equivalent to roughly eight others because you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=884" target="_blank">00:14:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">can rotate the board, which gives you a factor of four, and you can also flip it over.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=890" target="_blank">00:14:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's another factor too. So I might have needed only three to the ninth over eight positions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=898" target="_blank">00:14:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">plus a little bit. But anyway, that was a part of the program to squeeze it into this tiny...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=906" target="_blank">00:15:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So you tried to find an efficient representation that took account for that kind of rotation?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=912" target="_blank">00:15:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I had to, otherwise I couldn't do the learning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=914" target="_blank">00:15:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Wow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=916" target="_blank">00:15:16.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But I had three parts to my tic-tac-toe program, and I called it brain one, brain two, and brain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=924" target="_blank">00:15:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">three.

And then, before throwing it in the garbage. And then, so he said, "Oh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=1780" target="_blank">00:29:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah." He planned to keep it for posterity, but now he realized that posterity is a bit too much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=1786" target="_blank">00:29:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">for him to handle, so he sent it to me.

What's the conclusion? And I stated my philosophy is that the ideal thing is that it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=1857" target="_blank">00:30:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">something where the reader knows that there's probably a joke here if he only understood it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=1864" target="_blank">00:31:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and this is a motivation to understand, to think about it a little bit. But anyway,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=1871" target="_blank">00:31:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">very delicate humor.

He wrote down during the lunch on a napkin,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=3783" target="_blank">01:03:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">all of the facts about what he called numbers.

I thought it was incredibly beautiful. Later in 1972, my sabbatical year</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=3811" target="_blank">01:03:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">began and I went to Norway. In December of that year, in the middle of the night,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=3817" target="_blank">01:03:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the thought came to me, Conway's theory about numbers would be a great thing to teach students</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=3826" target="_blank">01:03:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">how to invent research and what the joys are of research.

At the end, in the morning, I woke up my wife and said, "Jill, I think I want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=3858" target="_blank">01:04:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">to write a book about Conway's theory.

So in January, I rented a room in a hotel in downtown Oslo. We</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=3887" target="_blank">01:04:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">were in sabbatical in Norway. And I rented the hotel in downtown Oslo and did nothing else</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=3896" target="_blank">01:04:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">except write up Conway's theory. And I changed the name to Surreal Numbers. So this book is now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=3903" target="_blank">01:05:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">published as Surreal Numbers. And we'd always wondered, "Would he like to have an affair in a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=3913" target="_blank">01:05:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">hotel room?" So we figured out that she would visit me twice during the week. Things like this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=3919" target="_blank">01:05:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, we would try to sneak in. This hotel was run by a mission organization. These ladies were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=3928" target="_blank">01:05:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">probably very strict. But anyway, so- Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=3930" target="_blank">01:05:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And- It's a wild week in every way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=3935" target="_blank">01:05:35.520</a></span> | <span class="t">But the thing is, I had lost that napkin in which he wrote the theory. But I looked for it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=3942" target="_blank">01:05:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">but I couldn't find it. So I tried to recreate from memory what he had told me at that lunch</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=3948" target="_blank">01:05:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">in Calgary. And as I wrote the book, I was going through exactly what the characters in the book</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=3957" target="_blank">01:05:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">were supposed to be doing. So I start with the two axioms and start out the whole thing. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=3962" target="_blank">01:06:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">everything is defined, flows from that, but you have to discover why. And every mistake that I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=3969" target="_blank">01:06:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">make as I'm trying to discover it, my characters make too. And so it's a long, long story. But I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=3978" target="_blank">01:06:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">worked through this week. And it was one of the most intense weeks of my life. And I described it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=3991" target="_blank">01:06:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">in other places.

And on the seventh day, I rested.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=3997" target="_blank">01:06:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And I sent to my secretary to type it.

There's something that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=4837" target="_blank">01:20:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">got my name attached to it called Knuth-Arrow notation, but it's a notation for very large</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=4844" target="_blank">01:20:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">numbers.

That'd</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=4934" target="_blank">01:22:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">be 16. Okay. So that's the double arrow. And now you can do a triple arrow, of course, and so on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=4948" target="_blank">01:22:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And I had this paper called, well, essentially big numbers. You try to impress your friend,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=4958" target="_blank">01:22:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">but by saying a number they never thought of before. And I gave a special name for it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=4966" target="_blank">01:22:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and designed a font for it that has script K and so on. But it really is 10, I think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=4973" target="_blank">01:22:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">like 10 quadruple arrow three or something like that. And I claim that that number is so mind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=4980" target="_blank">01:23:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">boggling that you can't comprehend how large it is. But anyway, I talked to Feynman about this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=4987" target="_blank">01:23:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and he said, "Oh, let's just use double arrow. But instead of taking integers, let's consider</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=4995" target="_blank">01:23:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">complex numbers." So you have, I mean, okay, X arrow, arrow two, that means X to the X.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5003" target="_blank">01:23:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But what about X double arrow 2.5? Well, that's not too hard to figure out. That's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5013" target="_blank">01:23:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">interpolate between those. But what about X double arrow I, or one plus I, or some complex number?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5024" target="_blank">01:23:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And so he claimed that there was no analytic function that would do the job.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5033" target="_blank">01:23:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">But I didn't know how he could claim that that wasn't true.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5040" target="_blank">01:24:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And his next question was, did then have a complex number of arrows?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5045" target="_blank">01:24:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5050" target="_blank">01:24:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Wow, okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5051" target="_blank">01:24:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's Feynman.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5053" target="_blank">01:24:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Can you describe what the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm does, and how did you come to develop</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5064" target="_blank">01:24:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">it?

Morris.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5130" target="_blank">01:25:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So we would go through and

look at the next word, and sure enough, it's an O, and then an R.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5140" target="_blank">01:25:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But then, too bad, the next letter is E.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5146" target="_blank">01:25:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So we missed out on Morris.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5150" target="_blank">01:25:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we go back and start looking for another.</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5155" target="_blank">01:25:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's the obvious way to do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5157" target="_blank">01:25:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5160" target="_blank">01:26:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And Jim Morris noticed there was a more clever way to do it.</span></div><div

that letter M at character position 1000.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5173" target="_blank">01:26:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So it was started next at character position 1001.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5178" target="_blank">01:26:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But he said, no, look, we already read the O and the R, and we know that they aren't M's.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5187" target="_blank">01:26:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So we don't have to read those over again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5192" target="_blank">01:26:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And this gets pretty tricky when the word isn't Morris, but it's more like abracadabra,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5201" target="_blank">01:26:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">where you have

several months later, somebody had looked at it, didn't look right,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5238" target="_blank">01:27:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and so they ripped it out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5239"

come up with a very peculiar theorem</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5304" target="_blank">01:28:24.400</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">01:28:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And a stack automaton is a machine that can't do everything a Turing machine can do, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5317" target="_blank">01:28:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">it can only look at something at the top of a stack, or it can put more things on the stack,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5323" target="_blank">01:28:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">or it can take things off the stack.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5326" target="_blank">01:28:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It can't remember a long string of symbols, but it can remember them in reverse order.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5332" target="_blank">01:28:52.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you tell a stack automaton A, B, C, D, E, it can tell you afterwards E, D, C, B, A.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5340" target="_blank">01:29:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It doesn't have any other memory except this one thing that it can

amazing thing that says, if a stack automaton can recognize a language</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5356" target="_blank">01:29:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">where the strings of the language are length N, in any amount of time whatsoever,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5361" target="_blank">01:29:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to the stack automaton, you might use a zillion steps, a regular computer can recognize that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5368" target="_blank">01:29:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">same language in time N log N. So Steve had a way of transforming a computation that goes on and on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5375" target="_blank">01:29:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and on and on, into using different data structures, into something that you can do on a regular</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5382" target="_blank">01:29:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">computer, fast. The stack automaton goes slow, but somehow the fact that it can do it at all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5392" target="_blank">01:29:52.720</a></span> | <span class="t">means that there has to be a fast way. So I thought this was a pretty cool theorem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5398" target="_blank">01:29:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I tried it out on a problem where I knew a stack automaton could do it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5407" target="_blank">01:30:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">but I couldn't figure out a fast way to do it on a regular computer. I thought I was a pretty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5412" target="_blank">01:30:12.720</a></span> | <span class="t">good programmer, but by golly, I couldn't think of any way to recognize this language efficiently.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5421" target="_blank">01:30:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So I went through Steve Cook's construction. I filled my blackboard with all the, everything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5429" target="_blank">01:30:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">that stack automaton did, you know, I wrote down. And then I tried to see patterns in that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5440" target="_blank">01:30:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and how did he convert that into a computer program on a regular machine? And finally,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5446" target="_blank">01:30:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I psyched it out.

So the problem I had started with was not the string matching problem, but then I realized</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5484" target="_blank">01:31:24.480</a></span> | <span class="t">that the string matching problem was another thing which could be done by a stack automaton.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5490" target="_blank">01:31:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And so when I looked at what that told me, then I had a nice algorithm for this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5496" target="_blank">01:31:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">string matching problem.

And I worked it out, and I wrote this little paper called "Automata Theory Can Be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5510" target="_blank">01:31:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Useful." And the reason was that it was the first, I mean, I had been reading all kinds of papers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5516" target="_blank">01:31:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">about automata theory, but it never taught me, it never improved my programming for everyday</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5523" target="_blank">01:32:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">problems. It was something that you published in journals and it was interesting stuff. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5530" target="_blank">01:32:10.080</a></span> | <span class="t">here was a case where I couldn't figure out how to write the program. I had a theorem from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5535" target="_blank">01:32:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">automata theory, then I knew how to write the program. So this was, for me, a change in life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5544" target="_blank">01:32:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I started to say, maybe I should learn more about automata theory. And I showed this note to Vaughn</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5552" target="_blank">01:32:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Pratt, and he said, "Hey, that's similar to something I was working on." And then, and Jim</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5560" target="_blank">01:32:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Morris was at Berkeley too at the time. Anyway, he's had an illustrious career, but I haven't kept</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5568" target="_blank">01:32:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">track of Jim, but Vaughn is my colleague at Stanford and my student later.

So we found out that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5581" target="_blank">01:33:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">we'd all been working on the same thing. So it was our algorithm, we each discovered it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5585" target="_blank">01:33:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">independently, but each of us had discovered a different part of the elephant, a different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5593" target="_blank">01:33:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">aspect of it. And so we could put our things together. It was my job to write the paper.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5599" target="_blank">01:33:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">How did the elephant spring to life?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5602" target="_blank">01:33:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Spring to life was because I had drafted this paper, automata theory can be useful,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5611" target="_blank">01:33:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">which was seen by Vaughn and then by Jim.

Well, yeah, that's, I don't know how to answer questions like that, but in this case,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5659" target="_blank">01:34:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">it's pretty clear. Because it's called the birth of the giant component. Okay, so now let me explain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5672" target="_blank">01:34:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that because this is actually gets into physics too. And it gets into something called Bose-Einstein</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5678" target="_blank">01:34:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">statistics, but anyway, it's got some interesting stories and it connected with Berkeley again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5686" target="_blank">01:34:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So start with the idea of a random graph. Now this is, here we just say we have N points that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5698" target="_blank">01:34:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">are totally unconnected and there's no geometry involved. There's no saying some points are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5705" target="_blank">01:35:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">further apart than others. All points are exactly alike. And let's say we have a hundred points</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5713" target="_blank">01:35:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and we number them from zero to nine, nine. All right. Now let's take pi, the digits of pi, so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5725" target="_blank">01:35:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">two at a time. So we had 31, 41, 59, 26. We can go through pi. And so we take the first two, 31,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5736" target="_blank">01:35:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">41, and let's put a connection between 0.31 and 0.41. That's an edge in the graph.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5748" target="_blank">01:35:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Then we take 59, 26 and make another edge. And the graph gets bigger, gets more and more connected</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5758" target="_blank">01:35:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">as we add these things one at a time. Okay. We started out with N points and we add M edges.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5767" target="_blank">01:36:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. Each edge is completely, we forgot about edges we had before. We make an edge twice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5775" target="_blank">01:36:15.600</a></span> | <span class="t">We make an edge from a point to itself even. Maybe pi is going to have a run of four digits in there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5783" target="_blank">01:36:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">But anyway, we're evolving a graph at random. And a magical thing happens</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5794" target="_blank">01:36:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">when the number of edges is like 0.49. And so maybe N is a million and I have 490,000 edges.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5808" target="_blank">01:36:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Then it almost all the time, it consists of isolated trees, not even any loops.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5821" target="_blank">01:37:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a very small number of edges so far. A little less than half N.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5826" target="_blank">01:37:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But if I had 0.51 edges, it's a little more than half N.

And if you start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5924" target="_blank">01:38:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">out with a large number n and you repeat this process, all of a sudden a big bang happens</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5931" target="_blank">01:38:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">at one half n.

So Dick Karp, one of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=5990" target="_blank">01:39:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">leading experts on randomized algorithms, had his students looking at this at Berkeley.

There never were two guys with loops. Wow, interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=6066" target="_blank">01:41:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">In these experiments. Okay. So anyway, almost always, certainly not always. But with very high</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=6076" target="_blank">01:41:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">probability, this seemed to be true. So we heard about this rumor at Stanford, and we said, "Hmm,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=6083" target="_blank">01:41:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">if that's true, then a lot more must also be true. So there's a whole theory out there waiting to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=6089" target="_blank">01:41:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">discovered that we haven't ever thought about. So let's take a look at it." And so we looked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=6094" target="_blank">01:41:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">closer and we found out, no, actually, it's not true. But in fact, it's almost true. Namely,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=6103" target="_blank">01:41:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a very short interval of time when it's true. And if you don't happen to look at it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=6110" target="_blank">01:41:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">during that short interval of time, then you miss it. So in other words, there'll be a period where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=6118" target="_blank">01:41:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">there are two or three components that have loops, but they join together pretty soon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=6125" target="_blank">01:42:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So-</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=6127" target="_blank">01:42:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">If you don't have a real fast shutter speed, you're going to miss that instant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=6135" target="_blank">01:42:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So separate loops don't exist for long.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=6138" target="_blank">01:42:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">That's it. Yeah. I started looking at this to make it quantitative. And the basic problem was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=6145" target="_blank">01:42:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">to slow down the Big Bang so that I could watch it happening. I think I can explain it actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=6151" target="_blank">01:42:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">in fairly elementary terms, even without writing a formula-</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=6157" target="_blank">01:42:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's try.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=6157" target="_blank">01:42:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Like Hawking would do. And so let's watch the evolution. And at first,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=6166" target="_blank">01:42:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">these edges are coming along and they're just making things without loops, which we call trees.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=6172" target="_blank">01:42:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So then all of a sudden, a loop first appears. So at that point, I have one component that has a loop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=6178" target="_blank">01:42:58.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Now I say that the complexity of a component is the number of edges minus the number of vertices.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=6187" target="_blank">01:43:07.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So if I have a loop, I have like a loop of length five, has five edges and five vertices.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=6196" target="_blank">01:43:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Mm-hmm.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=6196" target="_blank">01:43:16.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Or I could put a tail on that, and that would be another edge, another vertex.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=6202" target="_blank">01:43:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like a zero, one, two complexity kind of thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=6205" target="_blank">01:43:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So if the complexity is zero, we have one loop I call it, a cycle, or I call it a cyclic component.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=6213" target="_blank">01:43:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So a cyclic component looks like a wheel to which you attach fibers or trees.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=6224" target="_blank">01:43:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">They go branching, but there are no more loops. There's only one loop and everything else</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=6229" target="_blank">01:43:49.360</a></span> | <span class="t">feeds into that loop. And that has complexity zero. But a tree itself has complexity minus one,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=6237" target="_blank">01:43:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">because it has, like it might have 10 vertices and nine edges to tie them together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=6245" target="_blank">01:44:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So nine minus 10 is minus one. So complexity minus one is a tree. It's got to be connected.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=6253" target="_blank">01:44:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what I mean by a component. It's got to be connected.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=6255" target="_blank">01:44:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">If I have 10 things connected, I have to have nine edges.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=6259" target="_blank">01:44:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Can you clarify why when complexity goes, can go above zero? I'm a little confused why.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=6268" target="_blank">01:44:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. So the complexity plus one is the number of loops. So if complexity is zero, I have one loop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=6275" target="_blank">01:44:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">If complexity is one, that means I have one more edge than I have vertices.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=6283" target="_blank">01:44:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So I might have like 11 edges and 10 vertices. So it turns, we call it a bicycle because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=6291" target="_blank">01:44:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">it's got two loops and it's got to have two loops in it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=6294" target="_blank">01:44:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Why can't it be trees just going off of the loop?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=6300" target="_blank">01:45:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I would need more edges than that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=6303" target="_blank">01:45:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, right. Right. Okay. I got it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=6306" target="_blank">01:45:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So every time I get another loop, I get another excess of edges over vertices.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=6311" target="_blank">01:45:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I got you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=6312" target="_blank">01:45:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So in other words, we start out and after I have one loop, I have one component that has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=6320" target="_blank">01:45:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">a cycle in it. Now the next step, according to the rumor, would be that at the next step,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=6329" target="_blank">01:45:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I would have a bicycle in the evolution of almost all graphs. It would go from cycle to bicycle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=6338" target="_blank">01:45:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But in fact, there's a certain probability it goes from cycle to two different cycles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=6346" target="_blank">01:45:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And I worked out the probability was something like five out of 24.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=6351" target="_blank">01:45:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">That's pretty high.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=6353" target="_blank">01:45:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">It was substantial.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=6355" target="_blank">01:45:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But still, soon they're going to merge together almost.

The next step is you either have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=6371" target="_blank">01:46:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">three or you have two, one or you have one, one, one. Okay. And so I worked out the probability</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=6377" target="_blank">01:46:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">for those transitions.

So every time you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=7347" target="_blank">02:02:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">have an edge between vertices, you take the difference between those numbers. And that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE1R8FYUJm0&t=7354" target="_blank">02:02:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">difference has got to be, I'll tell you what edge it is.
