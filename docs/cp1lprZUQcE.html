And when he came home, he'd been twice wounded. He'd been very badly wounded in North Africa.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp1lprZUQcE&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And then he was shot in the neck in Italy, eventually got home.

Went from kind of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp1lprZUQcE&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Italian campaign to European theatre. Didn't see so much action at the end. But, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp1lprZUQcE&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.960</a></span> | <span class="t">like a lot of British troops, if you were in a certain division at a certain time, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp1lprZUQcE&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">you ended up passing very close to Belsen.

That's the sort of basic principle behind the strategic air campaign. When we talk about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp1lprZUQcE&t=1369" target="_blank">00:22:49.020</a></span> | <span class="t">the strategic air campaign, we talk about strategic air forces which are operating in isolation from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp1lprZUQcE&t=1373" target="_blank">00:22:53.580</a></span> | <span class="t">other armed forces. So a tactical air force, for example, is an air force which is offering close</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp1lprZUQcE&t=1378" target="_blank">00:22:58.540</a></span> | <span class="t">air support for ground operations.

I think you're,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp1lprZUQcE&t=2285" target="_blank">00:38:05.420</a></span> | <span class="t">you're being too nice on France here.

While</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp1lprZUQcE&t=5249" target="_blank">01:27:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">they might not have been creating a huge army or producing enough spitfires that they might want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp1lprZUQcE&t=5255" target="_blank">01:27:35.160</a></span> | <span class="t">up until this point, what they have also been doing is stockpiling bauxite and copper and tungsten</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp1lprZUQcE&t=5260" target="_blank">01:27:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and huge reserves.

So like I said, we could probably talk for many hours on each of these topics,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp1lprZUQcE&t=9740" target="_blank">02:42:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">but let's look at some of the battles and maybe you can tell me which jumps out at you. I want to talk to you about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp1lprZUQcE&t=9747" target="_blank">02:42:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the Western Front and definitely talk about Normandy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp1lprZUQcE&t=9752" target="_blank">02:42:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's the Battle of Midway in 1942, which is a naval battle. There's Eastern Front, Stalingrad,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp1lprZUQcE&t=9760" target="_blank">02:42:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">probably the deadliest battle in human history. Then there's the Battle of Kursk, which is a tank</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp1lprZUQcE&t=9768" target="_blank">02:42:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">battle, the largest tank battle in history, probably the largest battle period in history. 6,000 tanks,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp1lprZUQcE&t=9776" target="_blank">02:42:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">2 million troops, 4,000 aircraft. And then that takes us also to the Battle of the Bulge,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp1lprZUQcE&t=9782" target="_blank">02:43:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and Normandy, the Italian campaign that you talk a lot about. So what do you think is interesting to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp1lprZUQcE&t=9787" target="_blank">02:43:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">try to extract some wisdom from? Before we get to Normandy, do you find as a historian the Battle of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp1lprZUQcE&t=9797" target="_blank">02:43:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Kursk or the Battle of Stalingrad more interesting? Stalingrad is often seen as the turner.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp1lprZUQcE&t=9803" target="_blank">02:43:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, yeah, I think so. I mean, it's really interesting. So they get through 1941. Barbarossa</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp1lprZUQcE&t=9812" target="_blank">02:43:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">doesn't happen as the Germans hope it will. The whole point is to completely destroy the Red Army</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp1lprZUQcE&t=9817" target="_blank">02:43:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">in three months, and that just doesn't happen. And I think you can argue and argue convincingly that by,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp1lprZUQcE&t=9822" target="_blank">02:43:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">let's say, the beginning of December 1941, Germany is just not going to win. It just can't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp1lprZUQcE&t=9831" target="_blank">02:43:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And let me tell you what I mean by that. So if you take an arbitrary date, let's say the 15th of June,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp1lprZUQcE&t=9836" target="_blank">02:43:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">1941, Germany at that moment has one enemy, which is Great Britain, albeit Great Britain plus Dominion</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp1lprZUQcE&t=9842" target="_blank">02:44:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Empire.

It's got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp1lprZUQcE&t=9850" target="_blank">02:44:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Great Britain, Dominion Empire, USSR, and the USA.

For all the talks of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp1lprZUQcE&t=9859" target="_blank">02:44:19.360</a></span> | <span class="t">wonder weapons and all the rest of it, it's just not going to. It has lost that battle. Having said that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp1lprZUQcE&t=9865" target="_blank">02:44:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the Soviet Union is still in a really, really bad situation.

So in 1942, despite the vast</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp1lprZUQcE&t=9927" target="_blank">02:45:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">amount of numbers of men that they have at their hands, I mean, they create 80 new divisions in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp1lprZUQcE&t=9933" target="_blank">02:45:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">second half of 1941, for example. I mean, Britain never has 80 divisions in the entire Second World War,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp1lprZUQcE&t=9938" target="_blank">02:45:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">division being about rule of thumb, 15,000 men.
