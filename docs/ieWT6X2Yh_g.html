Thanks for having us here today. We're super excited to be here. I'm Sam and I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=20" target="_blank">00:00:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">one of the co-founders of New Computer. And I'm Jason, the other co-founder. And we're really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=25" target="_blank">00:00:25.560</a></span> | <span class="t">excited that we are starting today by letting you all see our pores up close, which is amazing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=31" target="_blank">00:00:31.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, when Sam and I started New Computer, we did so because we believed that for so long,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=40" target="_blank">00:00:40.060</a></span> | <span class="t">we've taken certain metaphors and abstractions and tools for granted. And for the first time in what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=46" target="_blank">00:00:46.300</a></span> | <span class="t">feels like 40 years, we can finally change all of that. And we can start thinking from first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=51" target="_blank">00:00:51.900</a></span> | <span class="t">principles, what our relationship, not only with computing, but with intelligence, period,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=56" target="_blank">00:00:56.840</a></span> | <span class="t">should look like in the future. So what do we mean by intelligence? Because, you know, sometimes I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=65" target="_blank">00:01:05.660</a></span> | <span class="t">on the internet and I wonder if it even exists. Well, one way to think about intelligence is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=71" target="_blank">00:01:11.340</a></span> | <span class="t">ability to sort of take in lots of information, different types, different volumes from different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=76" target="_blank">00:01:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">sources. Visualize those dots here and sort of find ways to make sense of it all, find ways to reason,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">find ways to find meaning. And as human beings, as carbon-based life forms, we do this through a process</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">where at first we use our senses to sort of perceive the world around us. Then we, you know, process that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=99" target="_blank">00:01:39.420</a></span> | <span class="t">information in our heads and then given what we think, we then choose a reaction. So if we're lucky, we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=109" target="_blank">00:01:49.020</a></span> | <span class="t">are blessed with at least five senses. Six when I've had four margaritas. But as humans, we sort of are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.340</a></span> | <span class="t">inherently capable of just processing all of this at the same time. And that actually is how our short-term</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.060</a></span> | <span class="t">memory gets to work. And taking all of this context and information, we then get to form what's called</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.900</a></span> | <span class="t">a theory of mind. What is going on? What is, you know, how is the world relating to me right now? What</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.940</a></span> | <span class="t">should I be doing about it? So we sense, we think, and then we react. And how do we react? Well, there's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.540</a></span> | <span class="t">lot of things right now. But if we take it all the way back to the Stone Age and we think real simple,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.620</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of how people used to react and communicate is just unintelligible grunts. And then one day we,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.460</a></span> | <span class="t">that sort of evolved into a language as we know it. And to this day, that's still something that we rely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.220</a></span> | <span class="t">on to communicate and react to the world around us. And that's also how a lot of us think.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have language. But the language of communication is so much broader than just language. We're standing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.180</a></span> | <span class="t">here on stage right now. I'm making eye contact with some of you. Nice shirt. And I'm making</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.380</a></span> | <span class="t">gestures. I'm wearing these ridiculous gloves. I'm looking at Sam. I'm looking at things. I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.900</a></span> | <span class="t">pointing at things. And I can hear sort of laughter or I can hear people, you know, thinking. I'm taking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.500</a></span> | <span class="t">lots of information at once. And right now I'm sensing, thinking and reacting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this year, well, last year technically, we saw a really amazing thing happen, kind of with the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.340</a></span> | <span class="t">advent of chat GPT, I would say, where we saw the beginnings of a computer start to approximate that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.660</a></span> | <span class="t">same loop, where input was coming in in the form of language. There was some reasoning process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.260</a></span> | <span class="t">However, that actually works. And then the output felt also like language coming back to us. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.700</a></span> | <span class="t">this was very inspiring to me and Jason. And we've been spending a lot of time this past year thinking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.020</a></span> | <span class="t">about what's next and how this gets to feel even more natural for people to interact with computers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.740</a></span> | <span class="t">specifically. And so today we wanted to take you on a tour of a few demos. One which you can do with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.060</a></span> | <span class="t">the computer right now. And then a few which are kind of with futuristic or next generation hardware,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.980</a></span> | <span class="t">which may be available soon. And knowing that you're all engineers, we know that this will kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.220</a></span> | <span class="t">of get the sparks flowing, the ideas flowing, for seeing how, like, you might use some of these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.940</a></span> | <span class="t">things that are coming out soon or things that exist today to build things that feel more natural.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'll start by getting to a demo. And I will say this is a live audio visual demo. So I am foolish enough</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.420</a></span> | <span class="t">to make that choice. So we will see how it goes. Before we show any demos, prudent to point out that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.620</a></span> | <span class="t">none of these represent the product we are building. They are simply pieces, stories of inspiration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=305" target="_blank">00:05:05.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So the point of this first demo is to imagine we have a lot of things where we're saying, like, okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.300</a></span> | <span class="t">is text the right input? Is audio the right input? And we've been thinking about, it's not if those are the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.940</a></span> | <span class="t">right things, but when. So in this case, you'll see some measurements happening on the left here. What's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.900</a></span> | <span class="t">actually happening is that this has access to my camera, and it's taking real-time pose measurements of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.060</a></span> | <span class="t">where I am relative to the screen. So it knows I'm at the keyboard, basically, because it's making that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=338" target="_blank">00:05:38.300</a></span> | <span class="t">assessment. And you can see the reasoning in the side here, where it's saying user is close to screen,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.460</a></span> | <span class="t">we'll use keyboard input. User is facing screen, we'll use text output. And so we're using an LLM to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=348" target="_blank">00:05:48.620</a></span> | <span class="t">actually make that choice as it goes to the response. So let's try something else. And again, demo gods be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=355" target="_blank">00:05:55.100</a></span> | <span class="t">nice, because this may not work at all. But if I now walk away, and it doesn't detect me anymore, it should now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.700</a></span> | <span class="t">actually start listening to me. Hello? Can you hear me? Are you going to respond?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that's a no. It might not respond. But basically, what we are attempting to build here is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=375" target="_blank">00:06:15.420</a></span> | <span class="t">like, if I want to actually talk to the computer in a really natural way, if I'm there next to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=383" target="_blank">00:06:23.020</a></span> | <span class="t">keyboard, it should not be paying attention to my voice or any sounds, ambient sounds, and if I walk away</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.860</a></span> | <span class="t">from the keyboard, I might want to have a conversation with it, like walk around the room. It is listening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=396" target="_blank">00:06:36.220</a></span> | <span class="t">It seems to not to decided not to actually talk back. But, oh, it's talking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=402" target="_blank">00:06:42.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Is there something you need help? That sounds like an interesting project,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=411" target="_blank">00:06:51.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Samantha. How is your talk going so far? Yay!</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=416" target="_blank">00:06:56.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, you can see it paid attention, and it decided to ignore me for a while.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=425" target="_blank">00:07:05.580</a></span> | <span class="t">But anyway, this is just like a toy demo. You can see here we have, this is how it's working kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=434" target="_blank">00:07:14.780</a></span> | <span class="t">behind the scenes. It's like trying to decide if I'm close to the keyboard, facing the screen,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=441" target="_blank">00:07:21.100</a></span> | <span class="t">not facing the screen, and use that all as inputs to decide whether it should talk to me or just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=446" target="_blank">00:07:26.940</a></span> | <span class="t">display the text as on the interface. Cool. So.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=452" target="_blank">00:07:32.860</a></span> | <span class="t">The reason why we think this is interesting is because we think, you know, people are naturally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=459" target="_blank">00:07:39.020</a></span> | <span class="t">sensitive to other people. And we think computers, instead of asking people to adapt to computers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=468" target="_blank">00:07:48.780</a></span> | <span class="t">to be like, come up to me and type and whatever, should find ways to try to adapt to circumstances</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=474" target="_blank">00:07:54.300</a></span> | <span class="t">and context of people. Exactly. So, again here, it's like, in this case, it's adapting to where I am</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=483" target="_blank">00:08:03.260</a></span> | <span class="t">by using the pose detection, whether or not I'm actually in the process of talking to it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=487" target="_blank">00:08:07.420</a></span> | <span class="t">to decide to update its own world state, use an LLM to actually do that, and then use the LLM to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=492" target="_blank">00:08:12.700</a></span> | <span class="t">respond using the knowledge of that world state. And so, this is a really simple and, as you can see,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=497" target="_blank">00:08:17.580</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of hacky demo that is something you could build today. In theory, you could imagine how this could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=502" target="_blank">00:08:22.940</a></span> | <span class="t">be like a really cool native way to interact with an LLM on your computer where you don't have to worry</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=507" target="_blank">00:08:27.980</a></span> | <span class="t">about the input monality at all. So, again, takeaways are consider like explicit inputs, what I'm typing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=514" target="_blank">00:08:34.940</a></span> | <span class="t">what I'm saying, along with implicit, where I am. There's other things you could do with that, like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=520" target="_blank">00:08:40.220</a></span> | <span class="t">tone and emotion detection. You could plug in a whole bunch of different signals that you want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=525" target="_blank">00:08:45.500</a></span> | <span class="t">extract from that. And you can even imagine if I'm in the frame with Sam, and the agent knows Sam and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=531" target="_blank">00:08:51.100</a></span> | <span class="t">she had recently been complaining about me, I should probably not bring that up until I leave the frame.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=535" target="_blank">00:08:55.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. And as we mentioned that, using it as a reasoning engine, and then next one, cool. And yeah, and then we're adapting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=545" target="_blank">00:09:05.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we want to get to the futuristic stuff. Jason has been spending a lot of time imagining this, so he's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=551" target="_blank">00:09:11.420</a></span> | <span class="t">going to walk you through a few things that might exist shortly in the near future when new hardware comes out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=556" target="_blank">00:09:16.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So, when we think future, we still think the sensing-thinking-react loop will take place. To preface</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=565" target="_blank">00:09:25.340</a></span> | <span class="t">all of this, these are my personal speculative fictions, not representative of anything that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=571" target="_blank">00:09:31.020</a></span> | <span class="t">I think might actually happen. And this is a very conservative view of the next one to 12 months,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=577" target="_blank">00:09:37.420</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe. So, it's not a true future future AGI god-worshipping type situation. So, let's start with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=584" target="_blank">00:09:44.060</a></span> | <span class="t">what I call like a social interface. We're all really excited about, you know, certain headsets</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=590" target="_blank">00:09:50.140</a></span> | <span class="t">being released at certain points. And one thing that I think is interesting about some headsets is they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=596" target="_blank">00:09:56.060</a></span> | <span class="t">have sensors and they have hand tracking and eye tracking. And just like how I'm being expressive right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=602" target="_blank">00:10:02.620</a></span> | <span class="t">now, maybe there comes a day where I can be such with a computer that sort of lives with me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=607" target="_blank">00:10:07.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So, here I am in my apartment minding my own business.

You know, historically with deterministic interfaces,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=627" target="_blank">00:10:27.580</a></span> | <span class="t">I would have had to like find the hang-up button or go like, "Hey, Alexa, decline call." Like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=633" target="_blank">00:10:33.180</a></span> | <span class="t">thinking commands, thinking computer-speak. But like, as a person, I can be like, "Fuck off." You</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=637" target="_blank">00:10:37.580</a></span> | <span class="t">know, I can be like, "I'm busy." I can be like, "I'm sick." You know, like, all of this stuff,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=642" target="_blank">00:10:42.300</a></span> | <span class="t">the computer should be able to interpret for me and, you know, send, send, what's his name again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=647" target="_blank">00:10:47.980</a></span> | <span class="t">toxic trashiest, whatever, on his merry way. So, explicit social gestures can be a great way to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=654" target="_blank">00:10:54.540</a></span> | <span class="t">determine user intent, like the way I just showed now. But we should also consider interpreting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=659" target="_blank">00:10:59.900</a></span> | <span class="t">implicit gestures. If I give a really fast gesture with a slow gesture, my mood, my tone,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=665" target="_blank">00:11:05.260</a></span> | <span class="t">how far away I am.

And it might mean, you know, as you scale your application</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=674" target="_blank">00:11:14.700</a></span> | <span class="t">or hardware to different locales, this is something that you should pay attention to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=679" target="_blank">00:11:19.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I want to move on to talk about what I call new physics. And this part is super fun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=684" target="_blank">00:11:24.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, this demo is based on, um, a little, uh, I think on the iPad, which, you know, has over five daily</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=691" target="_blank">00:11:31.500</a></span> | <span class="t">active users in the world. It's very popular. Um, and here I'm imagining, like, okay, Midjourney,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=697" target="_blank">00:11:37.500</a></span> | <span class="t">if I was the founder of Midjourney, I would be putting all my resources and making some sort of,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=701" target="_blank">00:11:41.580</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, Midjourney Canvas app for iPads. So, in this one, I've asked Midjourney to create, uh, Balenciaga Naruto,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=709" target="_blank">00:11:49.340</a></span> | <span class="t">which now I'm realizing kind of looks like me. Um, so, let's think about the iPad. It's like this big slab</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=717" target="_blank">00:11:57.340</a></span> | <span class="t">that you can, like, touch and fiddle with, right? So, what do I want to do? Okay, I want to, like, edit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=721" target="_blank">00:12:01.180</a></span> | <span class="t">this photo. Um, but first, I need to make space. How do I do that? Well, very easy. You just, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=726" target="_blank">00:12:06.140</a></span> | <span class="t">um, you can just zoom out and now you have extra space. Very obvious. We do this all the time. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=732" target="_blank">00:12:12.220</a></span> | <span class="t">I kind of think my cat would look really good in that outfit. So, I kind of want to find a way to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=738" target="_blank">00:12:18.540</a></span> | <span class="t">that here. Let me just ask AI real quick. Um, hey, random AI sent me pictures of my cat. And,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=745" target="_blank">00:12:25.820</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, the AI knows me and has contacts and gives me pictures of my cat. And then,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=751" target="_blank">00:12:31.100</a></span> | <span class="t">what do I do here? Well, why can't we just take one of the photos and sort of just blend them with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=761" target="_blank">00:12:41.580</a></span> | <span class="t">the other? Um, and the metaphor you're seeing here as you sort of work with these photos, they start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=767" target="_blank">00:12:47.580</a></span> | <span class="t">glowing when you pick them up. And what does light? You guys know the Pink Floyd, uh, Dark Side of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=772" target="_blank">00:12:52.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Moon album cover. Like, we're really familiar with the idea that light can sort of, uh, provide</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=778" target="_blank">00:12:58.220</a></span> | <span class="t">different colors and, and sort of concentrate back into one form. And we're leaning into that metaphor</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=782" target="_blank">00:13:02.220</a></span> | <span class="t">here, implicitly. Um, and so it's now created something that looks 50% human, 50% cat, 100% cringe. I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=790" target="_blank">00:13:10.300</a></span> | <span class="t">really like this. How do we remix this? What is the gesture? What is the thing we do in real life that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=794" target="_blank">00:13:14.780</a></span> | <span class="t">remixing?

We shake a blender bottle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=800" target="_blank">00:13:20.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So, why, why can't we work with intelligent materials the same way that we work with real</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=807" target="_blank">00:13:27.580</a></span> | <span class="t">materials and just blend it up? This is totally doable right now. David, why aren't you building</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=813" target="_blank">00:13:33.740</a></span> | <span class="t">this? If you don't build this, I'm going to build this. It's fine. Um, so, you know, here, the metaphor</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=817" target="_blank">00:13:37.820</a></span> | <span class="t">is like, what we're trying to say is, you know, think about familiar universal metaphors like physics, like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=823" target="_blank">00:13:43.420</a></span> | <span class="t">light, like Meta Balls, like squishy, like fog, whatever. Because, you know, if you're designing an iPhone, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=829" target="_blank">00:13:49.180</a></span> | <span class="t">have to be very cognizant of the qualities of aluminum and titanium to make an iPhone,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=834" target="_blank">00:13:54.140</a></span> | <span class="t">but generative intelligence is a probabilistic material that's sort of more fluid. Maybe it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=840" target="_blank">00:14:00.540</a></span> | <span class="t">fog, maybe it's mercury. Um, and, you know, for this reason, maybe metaphors that are really rigid,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=848" target="_blank">00:14:08.700</a></span> | <span class="t">like wood or paper or metal, aren't the right metaphors to use for some of these experiences.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=853" target="_blank">00:14:13.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So, finally, I want to walk you through an experience that's inherently mixed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=858" target="_blank">00:14:18.780</a></span> | <span class="t">modal, um, slash mixed reality.

I should be like, "Who is that friend I said I'd spend Halloween with?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=950" target="_blank">00:15:50.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And you notice here that, like, we're imagining sort of projection mapped UI pieces that can work with the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=959" target="_blank">00:15:59.180</a></span> | <span class="t">context of the world you're in right now, such that you don't have to go fish out a phone or use cumbersome</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=964" target="_blank">00:16:04.460</a></span> | <span class="t">voice commands. Um, it just all sorts of naturally melding with the world. Um, and, you know, crucially,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=972" target="_blank">00:16:12.860</a></span> | <span class="t">I think one point we want to make is voiced in doesn't need to mean voice out, gesture in doesn't need to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=977" target="_blank">00:16:17.260</a></span> | <span class="t">mean gesture out, and visual UI in does not need to mean visual UI out. We can mix these modalities</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=982" target="_blank">00:16:22.300</a></span> | <span class="t">in real time for whatever makes sense in whatever context you're in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=986" target="_blank">00:16:26.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So, given that interactions that require multiple simultaneous inputs are now possible,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=991" target="_blank">00:16:31.260</a></span> | <span class="t">um, it's our job as designers and developers to sort of think on behalf of the user and think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=996" target="_blank">00:16:36.220</a></span> | <span class="t">when, what's the appropriate output given the current context, and be smart about it. Um, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=1003" target="_blank">00:16:43.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so again, the takeaways, as we mentioned, it's this idea of, we have a lot of sensors and, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=1009" target="_blank">00:16:49.340</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, contextual modalities available to us as ingredients, even today. There will be more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=1013" target="_blank">00:16:53.500</a></span> | <span class="t">tomorrow, as you kind of saw with these upcoming, uh, potential hardware releases. Um, but even now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=1018" target="_blank">00:16:58.700</a></span> | <span class="t">with a laptop, with things like typing speed, with things like, uh, the tone of voice, there's a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=1024" target="_blank">00:17:04.620</a></span> | <span class="t">of ways that you could gather context and extract signals from it. You could choose to process it in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=1029" target="_blank">00:17:09.580</a></span> | <span class="t">a variety of different ways. And so, all of that can now be passed to an LLM and used in a reasoning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=1035" target="_blank">00:17:15.180</a></span> | <span class="t">layer which decides how, um, both to respond in words and also how to present that information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=1041" target="_blank">00:17:21.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and so basically, everything can now be an input and your output could be everywhere and have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=1048" target="_blank">00:17:28.780</a></span> | <span class="t">every format. Um, at the same time, one might say everything everywhere all at once.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=1053" target="_blank">00:17:33.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, you want to be intentional with it. You know, if someone wants to generate a photo on their Apple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=1060" target="_blank">00:17:40.940</a></span> | <span class="t">watch, you're like, why, why? Like, no, use your freaking phone. Jesus. Um, anyway. And the last</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=1066" target="_blank">00:17:46.540</a></span> | <span class="t">thing we'll say is, um, probabilistic interfaces are hard because they have lots of different outputs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=1071" target="_blank">00:17:51.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So, a really great way to sort of ground these interfaces is to lean into familiar metaphors,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=1076" target="_blank">00:17:56.220</a></span> | <span class="t">whether they are from nature, from physics, or even from human-made tools and materials,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=1080" target="_blank">00:18:00.460</a></span> | <span class="t">like buttons, for now. Um, and you know, social norms is also a material that we work with, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=1086" target="_blank">00:18:06.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So, your banking AI agent probably shouldn't be able to have a deep philosophical chat with you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=1094" target="_blank">00:18:14.220</a></span> | <span class="t">That just socially doesn't make sense. That would feel weird.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=1096" target="_blank">00:18:16.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Exactly. Um, but on the same note, we've, we've, we've related all of these interfaces to what humans</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=1103" target="_blank">00:18:23.900</a></span> | <span class="t">perceive and experience now, but what might a truly intelligent interface look like in the future,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=1111" target="_blank">00:18:31.100</a></span> | <span class="t">where if we think we are, where we are right now, skeuomorphism, what is the abstraction layer above</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieWT6X2Yh_g&t=1115" target="_blank">00:18:35.340</a></span> | <span class="t">that? And that's kind of for us to figure out. Um, so, with that, um, yeah, that's all. Thank you.</span></div></div></body></html>
