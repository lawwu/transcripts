class="t">Someone told me when writing the papers, because that's where we had most of our butting of the heads, they said, let him focus on the content, and you help him focus on the structure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

class="t">So if that does mean he's going to speak his paper to you and you'll scribe for him, whether that's writing or typing, that's fine for the first year because, you know what, your second year, maybe then he'll type it or write it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

class="t">I didn't get it until later on, but we implemented that, and a lot of the tears and butting of the heads went away once I just kind of let go and let him.</span></div><div class="c"><span

<span class="t">Oh, I love that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37776840/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=1913" target="_blank">00:31:53.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think, Jenny, you already alluded to a term that keeps coming back to my mind, to hold loosely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37776840/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=1920" target="_blank">00:32:00.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Because if you take that little, the spirit of that little new first year essential student, and you have a grip on that, and you say, okay, we're doing, you know, these things every single day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37776840/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=1931" target="_blank">00:32:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And you have that level of expectation that is not encouraging, that is not honoring to where they are right now in their development, then it's very possible in your tight grip, you're going to squeeze out every ounce of enthusiasm your child will have to learn and to grow and to master, and they will feel defeated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37776840/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=1951" target="_blank">00:32:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And as an essentialist parent, that definitely is not the spirit that we're striving for as parents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37776840/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=1957" target="_blank">00:32:37.400</a></span> | <span class="t">We want them to feel encouraged and equipped for that good work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37776840/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=1962" target="_blank">00:32:42.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So I love the advice that you offered about tailoring to make it doable for your child where they are right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37776840/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=1970" target="_blank">00:32:50.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And you also alluded to Andrew Pudewa's famous saying that all essentials parents hold two, and that is easy plus one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37776840/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=1978" target="_blank">00:32:58.240</a></span> | <span class="t">That we want to do with our children, obviously, what is easy, but we just want to go one step beyond that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37776840/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=1984" target="_blank">00:33:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So they're always on the growing edge of challenging themselves to do something that might be just slightly more difficult, slightly more advanced, so they're continuing to progress and grow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37776840/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=1995" target="_blank">00:33:15.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I love that idea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37776840/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=1997" target="_blank">00:33:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Really, as we're thinking about the essentials program, I think we're also, all three of us have echoed this statement of this is definitely a process where you make progress over time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37776840/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=2012" target="_blank">00:33:32.020</a></span> | <span class="t">That the unique nature of the essentials program is that a child, it actually repeats the same information for three different tours, up to three different tours.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37776840/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=2021" target="_blank">00:33:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so they are being exposed to the same kind of thinking time and time again, which is echoed so beautifully in the grammar strand of the challenge program.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37776840/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=2032" target="_blank">00:33:52.520</a></span> | <span class="t">As our students take what they learn, the framework of language, and then they hang new clothing on the skeleton of that as they begin to study Latin as a second language.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37776840/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=2045" target="_blank">00:34:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Jenny, I really appreciate, too, that you spoke a little bit about what essentials looks like in your home, because, you know, not only do we come to community, we use community as our launch pad day for what we're going to do the rest of the week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37776840/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=2058" target="_blank">00:34:18.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'd like to think a little bit about, for especially parents preparing now for the coming year, what does essentials look like at home and in real life?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37776840/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=2068" target="_blank">00:34:28.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So, Jenny, I'm curious, what does essentials look like in your home during the week, and how would you recommend go into a little bit more detail about how families should structure their time and practice charts and complete assignments?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37776840/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=2085" target="_blank">00:34:45.100</a></span> | <span class="t">How did you guys accomplish that on the daily with banks last year?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37776840/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=2089" target="_blank">00:34:49.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think you could also build on that by thinking about who is he now and what do you plan to do in the coming year as he enters his second tour of essentials?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37776840/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=2098" target="_blank">00:34:58.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so essentials in our home changed very often, I'm not going to lie.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37776840/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=2104" target="_blank">00:35:04.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But I can't remember where I got it, but I got this little card that told me how I could do essentials in one hour a day, and it had checklists for my son to check off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37776840/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=2116" target="_blank">00:35:16.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, I told you about the student book that I gave to him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37776840/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=2119" target="_blank">00:35:19.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So we did have a set time every day that we sat down together because I wanted to do it with him that first year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37776840/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=2127" target="_blank">00:35:27.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And he would get to pick, okay, I'm going to do my vocab words first, and then he would do that, and he'd check it off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37776840/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=2133" target="_blank">00:35:33.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And I just kind of sat there in case he needed me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37776840/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=2135" target="_blank">00:35:35.560</a></span> | <span class="t">That's his personality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37776840/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=2138" target="_blank">00:35:38.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So we used those little sheets to check off all of the different components, and I did choose to use the spelling words because we needed some spelling help in my house.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37776840/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=2149" target="_blank">00:35:49.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And we did that very religiously the first semester, but as I said, I had a baby in January, so it definitely looked different that second semester.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37776840/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=2160" target="_blank">00:36:00.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, like you said, Kelly, I had held everything very loosely, so I was much more rigorous that first semester, learned that, oh, I can let go of some things, and I learned a lot for the second semester.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37776840/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=2175" target="_blank">00:36:15.180</a></span> | <span class="t">We always did it in the afternoons in our house last year, and this year, thinking through how that went, I think I'm going to start my day with our essentials after our morning time and our Bible time just to make sure their brains aren't completely dead because after doing math and reading and the other things that we do in our house, I think waiting until after lunch was a bit harder for them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37776840/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=2200" target="_blank">00:36:40.740</a></span> | <span class="t">I knew that, too, because during essentials, that's after lunch, and some days I could just see the tiredness in Banks' eyes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37776840/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=2207" target="_blank">00:36:47.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think this year at home, we're going to try to do it right after our Bible time to see if their minds are more engaged during that time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37776840/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=2216" target="_blank">00:36:56.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's one change that we're going to try, and I'm going to hold it loosely again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37776840/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=2221" target="_blank">00:37:01.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And I've already mentioned with his IEW papers, we definitely did those every week, and it was very helpful during that first semester.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37776840/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=2231" target="_blank">00:37:11.820</a></span> | <span class="t">During the second semester, because of life, I did not make him do all of those papers, but we focused on faces of history</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37776840/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=2240" target="_blank">00:37:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and making sure that we were doing that paper appropriately and really just dove into writing that one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37776840/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=2248" target="_blank">00:37:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So he got excited about focusing more on that paper.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37776840/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=2252" target="_blank">00:37:32.300</a></span> | <span class="t">This year, I'm hoping we'll get to do both of those.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

class="t">So we'll work on our faces of history, but we're still going to do those other final papers as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
