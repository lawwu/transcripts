And then finally you had vision, which is where you get to the fun</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">stuff.

And the idea was you moved up the stack in order, starting with discipline,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=129" target="_blank">00:02:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">moving all the way up to vision. All right. So what was the problem with this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It's missing some things. So here's what I discovered. It's missing explicit mentions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">of some things that are foundationally important. I learned from you, my readers and listeners</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">for cultivating depth, physical growth, intellectual growth. These were things that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">we used to talk about on the show. And we had the old bucket based paradigm for the deep life,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">keeping your body healthy, keeping your mind engaged. This was not explicitly called out in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">this particular formulation. What about craft or learning to do things well? This idea of how do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.360</a></span> | <span class="t">you learn to take on something difficult, deliberately practice it and get better at it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">This is key to almost any direction for depth, but doesn't have its own place in this stack.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">There is also some pushback on a lack of ambition here that when we get to vision,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">we were talking about overhauling parts of your life. But when people think about the deep life</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">zoomed out, there's also this notion of some sort of larger scale legacy leaving type of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">initiative. That's at a scale that was too big for this. And finally, and this was, I thought,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">something I found when I was just experimenting with this stack is there's two different related</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.560</a></span> | <span class="t">initiatives that are mixed together in this particular stack formulation. There's the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">initiative where you're getting your life together. Okay. If you don't have your life together and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">a control of things, it's hard to do anything values driven or interesting. And then there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the initiative of trying to really cool things that mark a life as deep in this stack. They're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">mixed together. Discipline. That's sort of getting your life together. Values is part of cultivating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">a vision of the depth. Organization is about getting your life together. Vision</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">is more about how to cultivate depth. And so the feedback I was getting from my own</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">experimentation is these are maybe two separate endeavors. Get your crap together. Okay. I'm done</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">with that. Now we'll turn our attention to how do we aim this somewhere depth. So these were all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">things that came up when I was looking at the original deep life stack. So we're going to try</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to fix that with our new version 2.0. Maybe I'll even type that. Let's see here. I'm going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">actually write on the screen here. Oh my, Jesse, I have no idea how notability works. Oh, I see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">You know what I've been thrown by? By the way, this is not interesting, but I switched my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">note-taking software. To what? Good notes, I think it's called. You switched it off of?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Notability I was using to teach my lectures and then it developed some bug where when it was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">projecting on the screen and I was typing into it, it would continually jump up and down where it was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">on the screen. So I liked the program, but it had this weird bug in projection. So I had to switch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, here we go. I'm typing on the screen, the deep life, deep life, Stacy, the deep life</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">stack version 2.0. All right. So what are we going to do here to fix all of those mistakes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">not mistakes, but we'll call them shortcomings that we were missing in the prior stack.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And let me highlight this to show you how good I am.

So how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">are we going to update the deep life stack, our systematic plan for escaping the shallows?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">To take in mind those flaws we had with the original version, I'm going to break it into two</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">stages. So in the first stage called stage one, this, oh man, that's not how you spell stage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Stage one is where you learn to become a capable human being.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=348" target="_blank">00:05:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">We're going to make this its own stage.

I like that. Jocko talks about becoming an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">imminently qualified human.

This is going to have its own collection of four stack layers. Once you're done with that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=399" target="_blank">00:06:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">stage two, four more stack layers, cultivate depth on top of that foundation. All right. So this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=405" target="_blank">00:06:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the first place we're changing things. All right. So let's actually draw our four stack layers over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=413" target="_blank">00:06:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">here for becoming a more capable human being. So we're going to have four here and then four for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=417" target="_blank">00:06:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">cultivating depth. You do stage one first, then you do stage two. All right. So we're going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=425" target="_blank">00:07:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">start as before with discipline. But now, again, this is coming from feedback. We are going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=436" target="_blank">00:07:16.640</a></span> | <span class="t">specify the three places where we're going to pursue discipline as the foundational layer of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=442" target="_blank">00:07:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the deep life stack. And that's going to be body, mind, heart. So as before, what does it mean</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=453" target="_blank">00:07:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">discipline? We're going to have you select some keystone habits, habits you return to every single</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=458" target="_blank">00:07:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">day, habits that you track, whether or not you actually accomplish them. They should not be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=464" target="_blank">00:07:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">trivial, but they should also be tractable. Unlike before, I'm going to tell you specifically what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=469" target="_blank">00:07:49.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the three categories are. You should have three habits and they should follow these three</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=473" target="_blank">00:07:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">categories. Body, you need a fitness habit, something about making your body more healthy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=479" target="_blank">00:07:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">This could be exercise. This could be involving food and drink. The second category is mind. This</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=485" target="_blank">00:08:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">is going to be making your mind sharper. You have an instrument here, but you have to train it how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=490" target="_blank">00:08:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">to think. So we need to lay down a foundational habit, probably built around reading. It's going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=495" target="_blank">00:08:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to be our best bet here, where this becomes a regular part of your life that you're tracking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=500" target="_blank">00:08:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And then heart by this, I mean other people. There's something you're doing on a regular</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=505" target="_blank">00:08:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">basis. And it could just be calling or texting or emailing a different friend or family member</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=510" target="_blank">00:08:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">every single day. It could be checking in with your partner or your kids every day and having</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=514" target="_blank">00:08:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">a conversation with them. Body, mind, heart, keystone habit for each. As we iterate through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=521" target="_blank">00:08:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the stack, you can make those challenges harder and harder. So if you're just getting started</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=525" target="_blank">00:08:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">with this, your body habit might be pretty simple. It's this 20 minute walk that you do to a coffee</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=530" target="_blank">00:08:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">store and back each morning, followed by 20 pushups. It might be simple, but you're doing it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=534" target="_blank">00:08:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">every day. As we iterate over time, that's going to get more and more potentially aggressive in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=540" target="_blank">00:09:00.240</a></span> | <span class="t">its ambition.

We go from here now straight up to control. This is what we used to call organization.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=553" target="_blank">00:09:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Same idea.

There's a big part about becoming a capable human. I only have so much energy and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=602" target="_blank">00:10:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">time to deploy each day. I want to do so with intention. So I'm moving this right up front</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=606" target="_blank">00:10:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">in the deep life stack. Right after you got a taste of discipline, you're getting your craft</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=611" target="_blank">00:10:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">together. On top of this, I'm then going to put craft, just learning how to do something really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=619" target="_blank">00:10:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">well. This, again, is going to be at the core of almost any reasonable vision of the deep life is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=625" target="_blank">00:10:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">going to be quality.

In other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=685" target="_blank">00:11:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">words, learning, even if it's learning how to play guitar or shoot an arrow, but systematically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=690" target="_blank">00:11:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">building up that skill gives you the type of muscles you need mentally speaking to say, okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=696" target="_blank">00:11:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">now when there's something else I want to learn to help transform my career, there's something else</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=700" target="_blank">00:11:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to learn to make a big impact over here.

So as a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=2476" target="_blank">00:41:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">student, he could just take a lot of time doing half focus.

How do you get better at actually training your ability to concentrate for long periods of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=2485" target="_blank">00:41:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">time? So I'm going to give you three pieces of advice. One is interval training. Do you literally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=2491" target="_blank">00:41:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">practice hard concentration using a timer? So you take a piece of work you're going to do. You set</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=2498" target="_blank">00:41:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">a timer maybe for 30 minutes and you say for that 30 minutes, this is full out intense concentration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=2503" target="_blank">00:41:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">If my mind wanders or I zone out, I stopped that timer. I'll come back and try this again later.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=2507" target="_blank">00:41:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So you have a clear indicator of success or failure success means I maintained full concentration for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=2512" target="_blank">00:41:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">basically the whole period.

So just straight up practicing hard concentration. If you're roughly at a rate,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=2525" target="_blank">00:42:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">which is what I've observed when I've done this with students of increasing the duration roughly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=2529" target="_blank">00:42:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">once every week or two, you can in about two or three months significantly improve your comfort</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqiQ2iiCnX8&t=2534" target="_blank">00:42:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">level with intense concentration.
