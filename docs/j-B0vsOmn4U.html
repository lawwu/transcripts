On my show, I tend to argue,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=48" target="_blank">00:00:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">no, no, start with discipline first.

I'm going to argue in particular for the notion that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=75" target="_blank">00:01:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the very first thing you should do on this path to depth is organize your life outside of work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=82" target="_blank">00:01:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So get organized about your family life, your personal life, the stuff you do outside of your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=89" target="_blank">00:01:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">job, to be in control of your schedule, to feel on top of your obligations, to be able to consistently</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">make time for the things that matter in your life outside of work. Of course, being organized in your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=99" target="_blank">00:01:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">job is important too, but that's a very complicated thing. We go into detail about that on the show.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=104" target="_blank">00:01:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Knowledge work is confusing and overwhelming. You essentially need a doctorate in organizational</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=109" target="_blank">00:01:49.840</a></span> | <span class="t">psychology to stay on top of email and chat and meetings. And that's a whole other issue. And it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=114" target="_blank">00:01:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">much more difficult in a longer term project. But what I want to argue is you start with your life</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.520</a></span> | <span class="t">outside of work, what you can completely control, get organized there. And this will be the first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.040</a></span> | <span class="t">step towards constructing a more meaningful life. So here's, I want to do this today. I'll start by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">expanding on my case for why this should be your target for the first step. And then I'll give you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">a crash course. I got three ideas. Do one followed by two, followed by three. That can get you a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">closer to feeling on top of all the stuff that's going on in your life. So let's start with this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">why question. Why start with non-professional organization on your quest for depth?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, as you've heard, if you've listened or seen my show before, I do think it's important to get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">a practice with discipline as one of the first things you do. And you're going to get that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">by organizing your life. So it's compatible with that idea. It is a particular discipline pursuit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that you could follow. So everything I'm saying here is compatible with my old discussions. This</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">is something to do to organize your life that is going to require discipline. But why this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">particular activity among all of the other experiments you could do to get more used to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">discipline? Why organization instead of exercise or fitness or reading more books or learning to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">play the guitar? Well, there's a few specific advantages I think this particular step towards</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">discipline actually has. Number one, it reduces the background hum of stress that makes aspiration</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and ambition difficult to grow. So if in your life outside of work, you have this chaotic feeling of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">my car needs to go get its emissions inspection, and I know my gutters are in a terrible shape,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and I haven't dealt with my flooded basement, and I haven't decorated the walls in this room,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and I haven't called my sister in a while. You have all these things swirling around just in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">your head. You have this sense of stress and chaos and reactivity in this time that should otherwise</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">be yours to control. That is not fertile soil for ambition to grow. That is not fertile soil</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">for aspiration to grow. It's not fertile soil for you to develop a clear vision for what you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">want in your life. So it's a discipline pursuit that's also making your subjective context more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">hospitable that everything else for everything else that's going to follow in the quest for more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">depth. It's also going to give you more mental peace and free time for reflection. So once you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">on control of your obligation, so you've reduced the background hum of stress, you then are able</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">to take control of your time and now can regularly make time for the self-reflective activities,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the regular long walks through the woods, the meditation, whatever it might be in which you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">going to start to have insights about what matters to you.

Let me pluck</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that out.

So you're going to have more time and space for the type of activities. They're going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to help you get clarity about how to move forward from here. It will support then. That's my third</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">advantage. Any of the other discipline pursuits that you might later put into place as part of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=333" target="_blank">00:05:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">your quest for a deeper life. So as that vision comes into focus, if you have control of your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">obligations and your time, your free time, you're now much more easily able to enact the plans you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">might come up with as you get more specific about where you want your life to go. And finally,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it's going to give you pragmatic insight into what's already going on in your life. And we'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=358" target="_blank">00:05:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">see this as I get more specific in the second half of the deep dive here.

But if you're going to choose something that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=404" target="_blank">00:06:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">going to help you get more disciplined, do this one. It's going to be my argument. Organize your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=408" target="_blank">00:06:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">life, take control of your reigns because you're going to kill a lot of birds with the same stone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=412" target="_blank">00:06:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. So how do you do this? We talk a lot on this show about organizing your work life,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=418" target="_blank">00:06:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">as I mentioned before, and that's its own complicated beast. In some sense, the whole</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=422" target="_blank">00:07:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">art of modern day digital enhanced knowledge work is figuring out your system that can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=428" target="_blank">00:07:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">ebb and flow with the influx and tainment. And it's like your job. You're a lion tamer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=434" target="_blank">00:07:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">but instead of lions is emails. And it's a whole complicated thing. Your life outside of work is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=439" target="_blank">00:07:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">lot different. You still have the same issues of overload and keeping track of things just in your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=447" target="_blank">00:07:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">head, the tension between reactivity and proactivity in terms of your schedule, the tendency to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=453" target="_blank">00:07:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">pulled into the simple and the simple and passive as opposed to the rewarding, but difficult and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=458" target="_blank">00:07:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">active. All that's still there, but it's at a much slower pace and you have a lot more autonomy and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=464" target="_blank">00:07:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">flexibility about how you deal with your life outside of work. So it's an easier environment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=468" target="_blank">00:07:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">for organization. So I'm going to pitch you a much simpler to implement system here that is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=474" target="_blank">00:07:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">streamlined for exactly this context of life outside of work. So what I'm going to do is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=479" target="_blank">00:07:59.520</a></span> | <span class="t">start by describing a dead simple system for life organization, right? Once I've explained that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=488" target="_blank">00:08:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">system, I have two additional steps about what comes next after this system is in place, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=494" target="_blank">00:08:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So here's a basic system to get started. It's going to have three components, a calendar,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=500" target="_blank">00:08:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">file storage, and a mail sorter. See if I have that right. Mail sorter, calendar,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=508" target="_blank">00:08:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">file storage. All right. That's all you're going to need. It's much simpler than work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=512" target="_blank">00:08:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's go through this. The particular order I want to go through this in is let's start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=515" target="_blank">00:08:35.520</a></span> | <span class="t">with file storage. And what I mean here is a dual solution, a physical and a digital</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=521" target="_blank">00:08:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">place that you could store things. The physical is a filing cabinet. We're talking manila folders</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=529" target="_blank">00:08:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">in a filing cabinet. If you don't want to buy a cabinet for your apartment, just get a file box,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=533" target="_blank">00:08:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">get on Amazon, $9. It's like a cardboard box with two metal rods where you can hang,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=540" target="_blank">00:09:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">hanging file folders in it, right? So you, no matter where you are, you can have one of these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=544" target="_blank">00:09:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">digital, whatever, Google drive, Dropbox, just a place where you can have digital files all stored.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=552" target="_blank">00:09:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, what are we going to do with the physical storage? This is where you store anything that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=558" target="_blank">00:09:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">is a physical piece of paper you need to hold onto. You have a place to put it. So we're talking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=562" target="_blank">00:09:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">receipts. We're talking, I don't know, tax forms, warranty cards, et cetera. This sounds obvious,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=567" target="_blank">00:09:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">but most people don't have this and it creates a lot of stress. So you need a place where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=571" target="_blank">00:09:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I need to hold onto this piece of paper. I know where to put it. I know where to find it. It'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=576" target="_blank">00:09:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">take you five minutes to set this up, but it is going to continually give you rewards in terms of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=580" target="_blank">00:09:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">less stress. Just knowing where that thing is. Your digital storage then is where you do the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=587" target="_blank">00:09:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">same thing for digital artifacts that you know you need to hold onto. Now, here's a tip. Often,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=593" target="_blank">00:09:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the thing you need to hold onto might come to you in the form of an email or a webpage. You filled</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=600" target="_blank">00:10:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">out your estimated tax payment for your state and online, and there's a page that says, "Hey,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=605" target="_blank">00:10:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you've done that." You could print all of this stuff out and store it. Or a little known tip,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=610" target="_blank">00:10:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">but I think a useful one. When you go to print... Hey, quick interruption. If you want my free guide</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=617" target="_blank">00:10:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">with my seven best ideas on how to cultivate the deep life, go to calnewport.com/ideas</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=625" target="_blank">00:10:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">or click the link right below in the description. This is a great way to take action on the type of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=631" target="_blank">00:10:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">things we talk about here on the show. All right, let's get back to it. You can select, "Oh, what I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=637" target="_blank">00:10:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">want to print to is a PDF." And anything you could normally print to your printer, you can print to a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=642" target="_blank">00:10:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">PDF file, which you can then drop in your Google Drive, drop in your Dropbox. So digital things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=649" target="_blank">00:10:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">that you need. Here's a record. Here's the email saying that you're confirmed for this house</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=654" target="_blank">00:10:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">reservation, digital, throw it in. So you got two places, digital, physical stuff goes in there that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=660" target="_blank">00:11:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you know you need to keep track of. All right, that's going to be the easiest of our three</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=663" target="_blank">00:11:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">components of the basic system. Now, let's move on to the second calendar. I'm going to suggest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=671" target="_blank">00:11:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">a digital calendar. And I'm going to suggest when it comes to your life outside of work,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=675" target="_blank">00:11:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">that you make your calendar the engine of your organization. You are going to run your life</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=683" target="_blank">00:11:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">outside of work from your digital calendar. So this calendar is going to have, of course,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=690" target="_blank">00:11:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">meetings or appointments. I'm supposed to go to the doctor, or, you know, going over to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=696" target="_blank">00:11:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">cousin's house for dinner. Sure. But you should also use it for one-time tasks and regular</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=703" target="_blank">00:11:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">occurring activities. So where are your workouts? You have them on your calendar. This is when I do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=708" target="_blank">00:11:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">them. It's on the calendar. Let's say you have a one-time task. I got to change the tires on my car.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=713" target="_blank">00:11:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm kind of sliding around a little bit. Don't put on a to-do list. I'm going to suggest calendar,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=718" target="_blank">00:11:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">specific day, specific time. This is when I am going to change the tires on my car. I got to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=725" target="_blank">00:12:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">fill out paperwork for my kid's summer camp, for example. If you don't want to choose a specific</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=730" target="_blank">00:12:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">time for it, choose a specific day and add that as an all day event at the top of the column</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=735" target="_blank">00:12:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">corresponding to that day in your digital calendar. So what I'm suggesting here is quite different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=740" target="_blank">00:12:20.560</a></span> | <span class="t">than what I suggest in the world of work. I am not going to suggest when you're getting, when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=744" target="_blank">00:12:24.720</a></span> | <span class="t">you're new to personal life organization, I'm not going to suggest complicated to-do list.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=749" target="_blank">00:12:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Everything lives on your calendar, you live off your calendar. What's going on today? Or I'm at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=755" target="_blank">00:12:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">work, but outside of work, see on the way to work, I'm doing this. And during work at some point</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=759" target="_blank">00:12:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">today, I got to fill out this paperwork. And then I'm leaving work early because I see from four to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=763" target="_blank">00:12:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">five, I'm stopping by whatever the party supply store, it's on your calendar. The things you need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=769" target="_blank">00:12:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">to do. Now here's the key. Everything's there. Anything you need to remember to do exist on a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=775" target="_blank">00:12:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">day. So it's not in your head. Now you're able to get a little bit of peace. You just trust your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=782" target="_blank">00:13:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">calendar. You see what you're supposed to do on a particular day. Things will get done. You don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=789" target="_blank">00:13:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">have to remember it. You don't have to look in a personal inbox on your email and see someone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=794" target="_blank">00:13:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">bothering you about something. You know, it's being taken care of. Now, of course, if you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=798" target="_blank">00:13:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">a very complicated life, you can move on and use a business style to-do list. But for a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=801" target="_blank">00:13:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">people, this is enough. Now here's the secret advantage, the sort of beneficial side effect of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=808" target="_blank">00:13:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">using the calendar to drive your personal life, is you now have control over optional important</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=815" target="_blank">00:13:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">things because you're just used to this idea of what's on my calendar for today outside of work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=819" target="_blank">00:13:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, that's what I'm doing. Those things can be unmissable appointments like your dentist,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=823" target="_blank">00:13:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">but it can also be things that you have optionally decided are important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=828" target="_blank">00:13:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I'm going to the gym and this is when I'm doing it.

So what you need to do is set up automatic schedules on your calendar for things that are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=1261" target="_blank">00:21:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">important and happen more than once, right?

So the information in these recurring</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=1312" target="_blank">00:21:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">tasks can get richer as you learn more.

So you wanna spend more time with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=1341" target="_blank">00:22:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">friends.

So you should be doing this maybe a month into running this system. Give yourself a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=1484" target="_blank">00:24:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">month to get a sense of what's going on.

I'm gonna stop</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=1489" target="_blank">00:24:49.760</a></span> | <span class="t">doing this activity.

I signed up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=1536" target="_blank">00:25:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">for this thing and it's sporadic and it's and it's haphazard and something stick and some things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=1542" target="_blank">00:25:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">don't. You get to this step three about a month into what I'm suggesting here. It's going to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=1547" target="_blank">00:25:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">a completely different picture. You will feel like you're firmly at the wheel of the car that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=1552" target="_blank">00:25:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">is your life and can actually aim it in different ways and have a good sense of what's happening on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=1558" target="_blank">00:25:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the road if we're going to stretch that metaphor. So all three steps of these together, that should</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=1563" target="_blank">00:26:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">get control. So yes, generally speaking, organizing your life in this way will give you exposure to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=1570" target="_blank">00:26:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">discipline and you'll feel more efficacious. So anything else you want to take on, you'll have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=1574" target="_blank">00:26:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">a more disciplined self-identity. Yeah, I can actually do stuff that's hard, but more importantly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=1578" target="_blank">00:26:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">you have the concrete tools in place that directly affect how you spend your time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-B0vsOmn4U&t=1583" target="_blank">00:26:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's from there that almost everything else is going to seem possible.
