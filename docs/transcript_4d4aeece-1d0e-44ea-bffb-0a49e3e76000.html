I say this from the very beginning because I know there are a handful of you out there who listen to this podcast but don't attend Berean Community Church.</p><p>If that is you, I want to let you know that the entirety of this short episode is dedicated for specific instructions related to our 2021 retreat. Go ahead and feel free to listen to some other podcasts unless you're somehow intrigued about the intricacies of where we will be staying, how to check out, etc.</p><p>If you are, bro or sis, to be honest, it's a tad bit weird. So with that said, here's Jason Choi. All right, welcome to the first ever audio download for the BCC All Church Retreat. It's time to get this started. But first, I've gotten questions as to why we're doing this this year.</p><p>It's for two main reasons. First, many of you are driving from far, especially from LA, North LA area. It takes several hours to get here. And secondly, after the prayer time, I know many of you are very tired. So we thought this would be a little bit more effective and efficient for you guys.</p><p>So first things first, I want to point to you the main contacts for the retreat. Any general retreat questions, it's going to be myself and Esther Leung. For small groups, it's going to be Pastor Mark. For family ministry dinner groups, it's going to be Dean Sin. For the BAM and college dinner groups, it's going to be Nathan Corchia.</p><p>For education, any questions related to the education, it's Pastor Peter Chung. Steven Mose will be the contact for Sprouts. Sarah Kim will be the contact for Nursery and Seeds. Ryan Chang will be the contact for Youth Group. Richard Lee will be the AV tech streaming guy. If you have any questions regarding any of those, just reach out to Richard Lee.</p><p>Pastor Joe will be worship. And as always, David Rim will be our snacks guy. Kevin Yoon will be doing the games and activities this year. And lastly, Cheryl Tang will be the point of contact for First Aid. As I mentioned before in the members meeting and in the e-mails we sent out to you guys, we will be located in two hotels.</p><p>The main site will be at the Westin Mission Hills Golf and Spa. And the overflow hotel will be the Fairfield Inn and Suite by Marriott. It's about a nine-minute drive between the two, four and a half miles apart. If you guys don't know, you should have received an e-mail by now regarding the assigned hotel.</p><p>If you haven't received anything, please reach out to myself or Esther Leung. All right, this is the perfect spot for our first Berean history question. Before I begin, I want to point out a few things. Pastor Peter Kim, Elder Phillip, Elder Joe, Pastor Peter Chung, Pastor Mark Lim, and Elder James Hong are disqualified from answering any of these questions.</p><p>And when you guys do answer the questions, please send me a text message. My phone number will be posted on the Facebook page. But when you send me the text message, please put your name in there so that I know who you guys are. All right, first question is a $5 Starbucks gift card.</p><p>$5 Starbucks gift card. What year did Berean Community Church start? And what year did Berean Community Church start? So easy. You guys should know this right away. I should be receiving text messages right now. What year did Berean Community Church start? By the way, I'm not going to give the answers until after the praise and prayer night, so they will be posted on the Facebook page.</p><p>All right, moving on. Check-in will be at 4 p.m. at the hotel lobby for the rooms. And retreat registration will be located at the Celebrity Ballroom. It's going to be directly west of the large fountain at the main entrance. You can also look for signposts. You can also ask any representative at the hotel lobby.</p><p>They'll be more than happy to help you. I would recommend before going to the retreat registration location getting your room number and info and parking close to the room first and unloading all your luggage there. Parking is free. When you check into the lobby, by the way, they will request your credit card info for any incidentals.</p><p>Don't worry about it. You won't be charged for anything unless you use room service or do an extended stay. Second question, $5 Starbucks gift card. Second question is a $5 Starbucks gift card. Who was the only pastor to come from outside of Berean Community Church? That's a pretty easy question, guys.</p><p>Who was the only pastor to come from outside of Berean Community Church? Again, text me your answers. Make sure to include your name in the text message if I don't know you. All right, moving back to the orientation. When you guys do come to the retreat registration at the Celebrity Ballroom, there will be a table with program name tags and lanyards.</p><p>And we do have retreat shirts for you guys. That's something new. It's included. The leaders have graciously given it to us for free. So I hope you guys are excited about that, as I am. The programs will have the schedule, the map layout of all the main conference rooms, and that also will be uploaded on the Facebook page as well, just in case.</p><p>If you arrive early, find a way to get dinner. It's a free-for-all until praise and prayer meeting at 8 p.m. All right, we have our third question. It's increased to a $10 Target gift card. Our third question is a $10 Target gift card. What was Berean Community Church's previous name?</p><p>All right, moving on back to the orientation. For small groups and dinner groups, you should have been contacted by your small group facilitator by this time, this audio post, and you should already be assigned to a dinner group. If you still don't know which group you belong to or you haven't been assigned to one, don't worry.</p><p>The Facebook page will have a list of small groups and dinner groups with photos of the leads. If you still can't find your name, reach out to Pastor Mark and he'll assign you to one. Also, after praise and prayer time on Friday evening, we'll give time for you to find your small groups just in case you need to coordinate where to meet.</p><p>All right, fourth question, another $10 Target gift card. Fourth question, a $10 Target gift card. How old was Elder Joe when he first met Pastor Peter Kim? Ooh, that's a tough one. How old was Elder Joe when he first met Pastor Peter Kim? All right, moving back to the orientation.</p><p>Please make sure to sleep early as there will be a time of devotion every day at 7 a.m. The doors will be open at 6.30 in the main conference hall, the celebrity ballroom. Nursery and seeds will be located in the Rancho Mirage room. And again, Sarah Kim is the main contact for that.</p><p>She wanted me to note that for the drop-off, the doors will open 25 minutes before each session. Please plan accordingly and pick up your kids. This may require you to leave small group about 5 to 10 minutes early. The Sprouts will be located in the Polo room. And the main contact for that is Stephen Mose.</p><p>The youth group, obviously, they'll be joining the main sessions. And the main contact for the youth group is Ryan Chang. Checkout is at 1 p.m. on Sunday. Please plan accordingly. You can drop off your luggages in the meeting rooms. All right, this is our fifth question. And this is a $25 Amazon gift card.</p><p>Our fifth question is a $25 Amazon gift card. Let's see here. This one's a hard one, guys. All right, what year did Pastor Mark Lim become an intern at Berean Community Church? What year did Pastor Mark Lim become an intern at Berean Community Church? And again, guys, I'm posting the answers on the Facebook page after the praise and prayer night to announce the winners.</p><p>Okay, please make sure you text me. And if you don't, have my contact info to include your name when you text me the answers. All right, lastly, Sunday before lunch, we will have an all-church photo at 12 p.m. Everyone is to meet at the large fountain at the main entrance for that.</p><p>And I think that about covers all the main logistical items. Thank you, guys, and see you all at retreat. And a special thanks to Elder James Hong for supplying and providing all this equipment so we can do this audio download. He also supplied some of the questions, which I really appreciated.</p><p>And hopefully, you guys were able to listen to the audio. Stream quality was okay. We know we had some technical difficulties, but hopefully, you guys, it was okay for you guys. Thank you, guys, again. See you at retreat.</p></div></div></body></html>
