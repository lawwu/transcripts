So I thought I would go over... I'm sure at this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=60" target="_blank">00:01:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">conference you've heard a lot about like what AI tools to use and how to work</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=63" target="_blank">00:01:03.460</a></span> | <span class="t">efficiently with Cursor and WindSurf, but I was gonna focus on how you actually, like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=67" target="_blank">00:01:07.980</a></span> | <span class="t">once you're efficient with these AI tools, how you build a team that's has the right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=71" target="_blank">00:01:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">culture and can actually scale and do the things you're setting out to do. But the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=76" target="_blank">00:01:16.360</a></span> | <span class="t">first thing I was gonna go over was kind of how we got here. So I spent like six</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=80" target="_blank">00:01:20.860</a></span> | <span class="t">months building up a ton of terrible, terrible software. I made like video game</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">moderation software. I made ML models to detect children's age in video games so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=89" target="_blank">00:01:29.380</a></span> | <span class="t">that you could separate adults from children in VR. I made bot detection</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.260</a></span> | <span class="t">software. And then as a side project on top of my side project, I made the first UI for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=100" target="_blank">00:01:40.520</a></span> | <span class="t">auto GPT, which was this like really hyped open source framework that came out right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=104" target="_blank">00:01:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">at the start of the agent craze. And basically I noticed that everyone in this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=108" target="_blank">00:01:48.940</a></span> | <span class="t">discord was excited to use AI, but they had no idea how to actually clone a GitHub repo</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=114" target="_blank">00:01:54.600</a></span> | <span class="t">or set things up locally. So I just spun up like a really ugly UI. I called it agent hub</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.320</a></span> | <span class="t">at the time. I thought was that it was going to be GitHub for agents. I thought this was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=123" target="_blank">00:02:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">really genius. But it was all kind of built upon the idea that agents were going to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.440</a></span> | <span class="t">immediately useful. So we pivoted pretty quickly after this, but I noticed that all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.480</a></span> | <span class="t">of the people who were asking the agent to do things were basically just describing complex</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.780</a></span> | <span class="t">workflows. Like if they knew how to write some Python, they knew how to make some API</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.940</a></span> | <span class="t">calls and some LLM queries, they could basically automate their entire request. They don't need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.940</a></span> | <span class="t">to like cross their fingers and hope that the agent will do it for them. So yeah, that was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">the realization. It was my co-founder and I at this time, we just started kind of editing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.580</a></span> | <span class="t">how you could configure an agent. Instead of asking for everything that you wanted, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.620</a></span> | <span class="t">could actually define the steps as a series of like nodes in a workflow. And then we got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.820</a></span> | <span class="t">into YC a few months later, we raised the series A, we hired two interns for the summer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.980</a></span> | <span class="t">and then we raised the series A about like four months later. And we were just a really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.940</a></span> | <span class="t">small team, kind of overfunded, but raised a lot of money so that we could hire the most</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.900</a></span> | <span class="t">exceptional people over the next year. And the general idea was just scale with under</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.880</a></span> | <span class="t">10 people because we noticed after working at Amazon and Microsoft that working on a super</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">small team is really fun. You can just move way faster, not sit in meetings all the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So now Gumloop is this, it used to be way uglier, but it's this workflow automation tool</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.740</a></span> | <span class="t">that a bunch of really large companies are using. So I thought I could go over how we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.560</a></span> | <span class="t">approach hiring, internal operations and then team culture. These are like things that we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">talk a lot about internally, my co-founder and I. I did want to put a disclaimer here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't actually know what I'm talking about. I'm trying to figure out if we're just getting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.700</a></span> | <span class="t">lucky over and over or if like our approaches are actually working, but take everything I say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.420</a></span> | <span class="t">with a grain of salt because it could be totally off base and it might ruin your company if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you do what I do. So the three things that we try to do internally when we approach</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.820</a></span> | <span class="t">hiring are be super, super picky, which is painful most of the time. Product led hiring,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.640</a></span> | <span class="t">a buzzword that we've been trying to coin and then making time to work together, which I'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.100</a></span> | <span class="t">explain in a second. But this is a screenshot from the co-founder of Instacart who ended up investing in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">our company. And we would ask him for advice because he's scaled a large company before,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">running candidates by him. And one time I asked him, like I sent him a candidate that I thought was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">pretty good. This was his only reply. He tends to write very short emails, but emphasizing that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.860</a></span> | <span class="t">shouldn't lower the bar. Like if you aren't extremely excited about someone, like if it's not a no brainer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.180</a></span> | <span class="t">you shouldn't even consider hiring them. So we've done like hundreds of interviews and tons of work</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.560</a></span> | <span class="t">trials, which I'll explain in a second. But if you're going to be a super small team,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.820</a></span> | <span class="t">every person needs to be absolutely exceptional, which oftentimes makes like investors of yours like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.940</a></span> | <span class="t">confused because you're still such a small team and they gave you so much money to scale. But you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.660</a></span> | <span class="t">to kind of be really thorough with your screening and then also really confident in every single person</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.020</a></span> | <span class="t">you hire. We've been trying to coin this term of product led hiring. So two of our customers ended up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.840</a></span> | <span class="t">quitting their jobs to join the team. And that was like the one of the easiest decisions we've made in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=305" target="_blank">00:05:05.820</a></span> | <span class="t">terms of hiring because they already loved the product. They had a ton of insight into how it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.100</a></span> | <span class="t">could be used in a business. So like our customer from Instacart, the one who originally found us and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.780</a></span> | <span class="t">brought us into the company, he ended up quitting and joining us. And now he does a lot of our like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">enterprise relationships and working with our larger customers. And then this screenshot is our head of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.080</a></span> | <span class="t">education and community. He was at Webflow before, but had a Zapier course and a ton of automation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=328" target="_blank">00:05:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">workshops that he was selling and then found Gumloop and got super excited. So that was a no brainer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=333" target="_blank">00:05:33.380</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think if you can focus on making a really great product that obviously happens to be accessible</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=338" target="_blank">00:05:38.540</a></span> | <span class="t">to people who you want to hire, there's a bit of luck involved there. But it helps with the hiring</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.260</a></span> | <span class="t">process because they know exactly what you do. You don't have to like inspire them to join the team.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=347" target="_blank">00:05:47.300</a></span> | <span class="t">They want to join on their own. And then making time to work together. So I think this is only,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.540</a></span> | <span class="t">hopefully this video plays. Yeah. Okay. This is only really possible if you have a really small team, but we do this thing where we rent Airbnb's and we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=364" target="_blank">00:06:04.420</a></span> | <span class="t">just go hack together for like four days at a time. We make like three weeks of progress in a couple of days. But the two people sitting on the left there are actually work trials, they were like interviewing at the time, but we brought them with us to Yosemite to just pack. And I think doing this really intentional sort of working together period is the only way you'll actually know if you want to work with someone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=373" target="_blank">00:06:13.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So we always bring people into work trials, they are on the team for several days as if they already joined the company. And then by the end, we're like totally confident whether this is the right fit or not. And we've done way too many of these, honestly, but it's helped us make sure that everyone on the team is exceptional.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=395" target="_blank">00:06:35.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Another thing we try to do in terms of operations. I mean, there's three things here. We have almost no meetings, purposefully so. I try to just let people build like I hired great people. So my plan is to give them the space to build, which is easier said than done. And then we automate everything internally, which is kind of a gum loop self plug. But yeah, in terms of our calendars, like my calendar is always insane, because if we're talking a kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=425" target="_blank">00:07:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">customers and I'm talking to customers and I flew back from New York this morning, for example, because I was working with customers in person. But everyone else's calendar should ideally be totally blank. We try to just give everyone deep focus time. If you're an engineer and we hired you to build exceptional products, like we should let you do that, not make you talk about building exceptional product for five hours every day. I think that's only possible if you have a really small team, because normally you'll have like five people on a project, you'll have to sync and kind of agree on the terms before you even start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=455" target="_blank">00:07:35.660</a></span> | <span class="t">working. And that just leads to kind of slowness everywhere. So also letting people build. So I used to be really involved in every aspect of like every feature we shipped. But now that we've hired exceptional people who are all better than I am at basically basically everything, all I do is kind of like inspire, I try to inspire what the features we should build are. So I'll make these like really stupid descriptions of the features that I think we should build based on talking to customers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=485" target="_blank">00:08:05.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I just let people do their thing. So that's kind of like only possible if you hire great people, but once you do, you can really just take a backseat and give them the space to be exceptional.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=494" target="_blank">00:08:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And then automate everything you can. So this is our internal Gumloop instance. We automate basically every part of the business as much as we can. And if there's something we can't automate, then we build features on Gumloop to let us automate it. So like before every meeting, we have like a deep research report that tells us everything we need to know about the customer, not just their outward facing information,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=515" target="_blank">00:08:35.620</a></span> | <span class="t">but also like how they're currently using our products. Are they a power user or not? What features are they using? So we were like totally informed going into the meeting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=522" target="_blank">00:08:42.380</a></span> | <span class="t">We have every time someone interesting signs up, we get notified why, what they're doing on the platform and also like an email drafted into my inbox so I can reach out to them, hop on a call and like talk about why they event, they made that free account.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=536" target="_blank">00:08:56.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's led to a ton of our growth. We have an AI chat bot on the platform, for example, that gets like 50,000 messages a day, but we have a Gumloop workflow that reads the chats with the chat bot so that it can tell us what people are confused about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=548" target="_blank">00:09:08.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we use that to inform our product decisions. So a lot of these little tasks in the company would have been someone's role or taking up like three or four hours of their day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=556" target="_blank">00:09:16.140</a></span> | <span class="t">But now we use our own product to automate everything. So also a lot of luck involved. You can be a small team if you are an automation company, but if you use Gumloop, maybe you guys could be more efficient.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=568" target="_blank">00:09:28.900</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the plug. All right. So culture wise, I think this is the most important thing. It's impossible to talk about having a really exceptional team if no one's having a good time or they're quitting. So we...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=586" target="_blank">00:09:46.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, one of the most annoying things I say at like basically every day when we talk about a feature that a customer is asking for is like, what if we built it today?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=592" target="_blank">00:09:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, what would that look like? And then it's kind of caught on. And now everyone on the team, I mean, first of all, I've said that like 10 times, but they're exceptional and they're really fast building engineers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=601" target="_blank">00:10:01.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So we often just challenge ourselves. Like, what if we put on a timer for 45 minutes and try to ship this feature right now with cursor, but this can lead to crazy burnout.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=611" target="_blank">00:10:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Like if you're always asking, what if we did it today on a Friday night at 8:00 PM, then people are going to have a bad time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=616" target="_blank">00:10:16.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So you have to be really intentional about making it fun. Like I mentioned, we do these retreats, but we're going like we're picking a cool place that I wish my boss would have taken me when I was working at a company before this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=630" target="_blank">00:10:30.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we get a bunch of food and do a bunch of fun things. Like we go rock climbing and biking and it kind of offsets the intensity of building with such a kind of like crazy timeline for every feature.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=645" target="_blank">00:10:45.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think like anyone would be having fun if we didn't have these like really exciting times to look forward to. I also think this is only possible. You can't fit 50 people in an Airbnb, but you can fit 10 pretty comfortably.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=656" target="_blank">00:10:56.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and then being really intentional about your company culture is another thing that I'm pretty adamant about. This is our company handbook. It's like a month or two out of date, but basically everything that we say internally, we just put it on a page so that we have to live up to it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=672" target="_blank">00:11:12.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, we wanted to kind of hold ourselves accountable for all of the, the ways we talk about building a company.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=678" target="_blank">00:11:18.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, and this is also like one of the things that convinces most of the exceptional people on our team to join or to book that initial call because they read our outward facing handbook and they know that like what we're about before they even meet us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=691" target="_blank">00:11:31.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and I'm kind of at the end of, uh, I was going to show the video, but cut it a bit short. Um, we are hiring a founding head of growth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=701" target="_blank">00:11:41.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you know anyone, you can email me there. Like I mentioned, it's a fun time, uh, pretty intense, but hopefully you know, someone or you want to join the team and help us scale.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=711" target="_blank">00:11:51.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Cool. Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=714" target="_blank">00:11:54.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=715" target="_blank">00:11:55.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=716" target="_blank">00:11:56.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=717" target="_blank">00:11:57.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=717" target="_blank">00:11:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9P1zvCupE&t=718" target="_blank">00:11:58.600</a></span> | <span class="t">We'll see you next time.</span></div></div></body></html>
