Now, this was at the time to break the all-time touchdown record. I think Breeze and Brady have broken that record several times since then. Oh, really? But at the time, Brett Favre had the all-time touchdown record, and so that pass was to break it. But what I liked about it is that we won the game.</p><p>You know, we weren't doing anything just to try to build a record, right? Did that get tipped? Kind of a close game. No, I threw a lot of wobbly passes, Mike. Oh, did you? It just looked like they got tipped, but I appreciate you asking that. No, so that was cool.</p><p>Yeah, it was still in the second quarter, so we broke the record and kind of got that over with and went on to win the game. But I love quarterbacks. Yeah, they played keep-away with me from the football afterwards.</p></div></div></body></html>
