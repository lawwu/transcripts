Frankly, sometimes even just saying what'd you do today is challenging. But if they say, I don't want to go to school tomorrow.</p><p>And you say, because that one word will often get them to open up. It's like these magical phrases that will work in any part of life. And if you see my interviews, you see, I will just throw in the word because interrupt someone sometimes. And because I've done that, they will go into the depth and the reasons of what they did and why they did it.</p><p>And so that's what it's about. Sometimes it's about asking a question. Sure. But often it's not asking a question. It's just a one word transition that I've handed to them and they can't help, but use to explain why. Why don't you want to go to school tomorrow? It's kind of challenging.</p><p>Now they're put on the spot. They've said something and I say, because now there's an expectation that they're of course going to finish the sentence. Because my friend doesn't like me because my friend is moved on to first grade and I'm still in kindergarten, whatever it is, it comes out naturally.</p></div></div></body></html>
