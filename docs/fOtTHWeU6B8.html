our framework that we built in-house with the help of BrainTrust.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">We have synthetic data from our corporate accounts that we use for seeding the evals,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

target="_blank">00:06:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And we have our own little runner that essentially kind of does a load test against</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

run it, report on it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=396" target="_blank">00:06:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and start acting

before</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=411" target="_blank">00:06:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">is being tested upon and that we

class="t">So here's an example of all the different runs that we've had.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=421" target="_blank">00:07:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">As you can see, it's pretty often that we run it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=426" target="_blank">00:07:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">We want to make sure that if any regressions happen that we act on them quickly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=430" target="_blank">00:07:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll actually go over one of those cases in a bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=433" target="_blank">00:07:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is really easy for us to act on it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=437" target="_blank">00:07:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">We can see this is a screenshot of Maggie's project for the Zap AI builder.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=444" target="_blank">00:07:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, as mentioned earlier, we have observability thanks to BrainTrust.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=449" target="_blank">00:07:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">We can see within it what happened, what were the inputs, what were the

target="_blank">00:07:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">previous runs as well and trying to find what went down, what went up, and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=464" target="_blank">00:07:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And, yeah, this is just showing that even further with all of our different graders,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=469" target="_blank">00:07:49.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the scores, if you will, of, like, the different things that we're looking for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=473" target="_blank">00:07:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">We want to make sure that the ones that we care most about are being highlighted and that we do something about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=477" target="_blank">00:07:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So after all this work of creating the eval suite and running them continuously,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=484" target="_blank">00:08:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I can say that before this we just had seven unit tests.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=488" target="_blank">00:08:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So seven unit tests that were run manually by devs and now we have over 800 of them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=494" target="_blank">00:08:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and they're all run part of this merge request as well as on a continuous basis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=499" target="_blank">00:08:19.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And we get alerted on if any regress.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=502" target="_blank">00:08:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So a lot better coverage there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=504" target="_blank">00:08:24.240</a></span> | <span class="t">This has led us to improve nearly 300 percent of our accuracy.</span></div><div

percent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=512" target="_blank">00:08:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We still have a lot of work there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=514" target="_blank">00:08:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">But it is fortunate that we were able to improve with this process that we created.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=519" target="_blank">00:08:39.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, we're very thankful for our customers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=522" target="_blank">00:08:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">These are just a few shout outs of how they have received that product.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=526" target="_blank">00:08:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">This is using an older UI, but it's essentially the same product.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=530" target="_blank">00:08:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, one thing about that product is a single shot approach can only take us so far.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=536" target="_blank">00:08:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is the next iteration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=538" target="_blank">00:08:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">As you all might imagine, it's a chat interface.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=541" target="_blank">00:09:01.040</a></span> | <span class="t">We want to allow the user to interact with the editor as they're happening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=546" target="_blank">00:09:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So a progressive iterative approach.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=548" target="_blank">00:09:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">You can see in the demo here the gif that we not only did the same prompt that we did before,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=555" target="_blank">00:09:15.600</a></span> | <span class="t">but we're also testing steps.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=557" target="_blank">00:09:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">We're also configuring fields all as quickly as possible to the user.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=561" target="_blank">00:09:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">This is actually not sped up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=563" target="_blank">00:09:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're really happy so far with the performance that we're getting out of this thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=567" target="_blank">00:09:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">The problem with it, though, now that it's kind of like an agent framework with multiple tools that it calls,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=574" target="_blank">00:09:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">we couldn't see what was the critical path.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=577" target="_blank">00:09:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">What is the things that we need to improve now to make the accuracy even better, to make the experience better?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=582" target="_blank">00:09:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is where, again, brain trust came in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=584" target="_blank">00:09:44.320</a></span>

class="t">This allowed us to break down the request from very granular observability to a very fine look into the problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=596" target="_blank">00:09:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And just as you would expect, you can actually see the inputs and outputs of a chat completion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=601" target="_blank">00:10:01.600</a></span> | <span class="t">The tokens, the time to

class="t">And we can quickly iterate on that one as well with a playground that they have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=611" target="_blank">00:10:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not showing that, but I just wanted to showcase that it's really easy as developers to go into it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=616" target="_blank">00:10:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and really understand what is going on with the performance of the co-pilot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=622" target="_blank">00:10:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So one of the things that ended up happening with the co-pilot is early on, because we wanted to get to market first,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=629" target="_blank">00:10:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">we wanted to just do GPT 3.5 Turbo.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=634" target="_blank">00:10:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, we started testing different models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=639" target="_blank">00:10:39.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And this view that you're seeing here was manually made for us,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=642" target="_blank">00:10:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">so that we can get a better sense of, you know, the performance of different models across different tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=648" target="_blank">00:10:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And as you change those tools, what is the performance characteristic overall?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=653" target="_blank">00:10:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And we settled on GPT 4 Turbo for our message router that we call.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=657" target="_blank">00:10:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And unfortunately, that came at a cost of performance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=661" target="_blank">00:11:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">That was a lot slower than before.</span></div><div

guarantees to our customers on accuracy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=668" target="_blank">00:11:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">That led us to want to make that better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=672" target="_blank">00:11:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we -- our evals started to show a regression.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=676" target="_blank">00:11:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">We were wondering what happened, and the reason for that was we switched to 4.0.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=680" target="_blank">00:11:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, you might have already heard from the conference that 4.0 is -- you need to be careful with it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=686" target="_blank">00:11:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And, yeah, we actually stumbled on that one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=688" target="_blank">00:11:28.560</a></span> | <span class="t">But I can say that with a few changes that we had to make and a couple of parameters that we added to the OpenAI calls,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=698" target="_blank">00:11:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">we're kind of back to the same performance that we were before.</span></div><div

now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=702" target="_blank">00:11:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So, as you know, we can see all the examples or all the different runs that we've had with experiments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=710" target="_blank">00:11:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">We noticed beforehand that we were 80% or better in most of our scores.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

performance benefits and the cost benefits,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=726" target="_blank">00:12:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">but we didn't want to lower our scores.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=728" target="_blank">00:12:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So, what should we do?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=729" target="_blank">00:12:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">This is showcasing some of the work that my colleague, Maggie Cody, had.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=734" target="_blank">00:12:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So, shout out to her for her hard work in this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=737" target="_blank">00:12:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">You can kind of see that all of our scores went down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=740" target="_blank">00:12:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And we can clearly see that there's a pattern to this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=742" target="_blank">00:12:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, what is going on with it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=744" target="_blank">00:12:24.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, drilling in further, we noticed that, you know, the 22 regressions that happened in here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=749" target="_blank">00:12:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">were all related to the OpenAI deciding to, like, forget our system prompt in some way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=757" target="_blank">00:12:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Or, like, to give an answer back that we didn't want to see or do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=761" target="_blank">00:12:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">It just, in some ways, we had prompts that were too fine-tuned to GP 3.5 Turbo.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=768" target="_blank">00:12:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we had to kind of regress our engineering, if you will, our prompt engineering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=773" target="_blank">00:12:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And that ended up allowing us to actually go back to the numbers that we were at.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=777" target="_blank">00:12:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So, this is the example of that prompt, how we were a lot more elaborate with how we were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=785" target="_blank">00:13:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">asking the GPT 3.5 to, like, respect our wishes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=789" target="_blank">00:13:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And afterwards, we actually just relaxed it a lot more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=792" target="_blank">00:13:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, trial and error really quickly iterating on that loop that I mentioned earlier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=798" target="_blank">00:13:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And that is what led us to make these discoveries.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=801" target="_blank">00:13:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, the other thing that I mentioned, just to showcase that, is, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=805" target="_blank">00:13:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">we made a change to the tool choices.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=807" target="_blank">00:13:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">We deprecated the functions usage over to the tool choice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=810" target="_blank">00:13:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">That tool choice auto is actually an asterisk there, because we are also going to experiment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=816" target="_blank">00:13:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">when making that required.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=817" target="_blank">00:13:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So, that's coming up next.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=819" target="_blank">00:13:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So yeah, overall, after those changes, we can see immediately that most of our scores went up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=826" target="_blank">00:13:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We're really happy that, for us, it's really easy to compare back and forth with previous runs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=832" target="_blank">00:13:52.560</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what's going on here on the top.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=834" target="_blank">00:13:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And, since then, we've been able to adopt GPT 4.0.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=839" target="_blank">00:13:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">We still have more work to do there, like I mentioned, but it's an iterative approach.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=844" target="_blank">00:14:04.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Before this adoption, we were around 14 seconds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=848" target="_blank">00:14:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And now, we're at three seconds for a stream-based co-pilot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=854" target="_blank">00:14:14.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And, of course, we had a lot more reduction, as we did before, or with this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=858" target="_blank">00:14:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So, in conclusion, I just wanted to share some of our stories of how we've worked with BrainTrust</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=865" target="_blank">00:14:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">from the very beginning to make a great product.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=869" target="_blank">00:14:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Really, we couldn't be happier working with them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=872" target="_blank">00:14:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And, I don't know, there's not much more to say to that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=875" target="_blank">00:14:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">High five.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=876" target="_blank">00:14:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=876" target="_blank">00:14:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So, yeah, thank you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOtTHWeU6B8&t=880" target="_blank">00:14:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you.</span></div></div></body></html>
