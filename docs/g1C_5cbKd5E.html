Well, and I think it gets even tougher if enthusiasm builds, because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1C_5cbKd5E&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that impacts the entry price on the marginal investment that one might make.

And so that's really what I think we're going to dig into a little bit today. Tap on this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1C_5cbKd5E&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and go a little bit deeper. Maybe starting with this idea is there is increasing evidence that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1C_5cbKd5E&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">demand for training and inferences is maybe deeper and wider than we thought.

But why don't we just start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1C_5cbKd5E&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">with this question about why do we need bigger, right?

We talked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1C_5cbKd5E&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">about that with Dara, co-pilots for call centers.

And now we're seeing a lot of conversation about autonomous agents. I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1C_5cbKd5E&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">mean, I think Benchmark is investors in Lang chain. Harrison Chase gave a great talk last week about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1C_5cbKd5E&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">what's next for AI agents that I encourage folks to watch around planning, UI, and memory. And,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1C_5cbKd5E&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, we hosted an AI dinner last week, and there was an interesting conversation that came</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1C_5cbKd5E&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">up just about a search use case within the enterprise. And in this particular company,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1C_5cbKd5E&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">the CTO took their million, well, 100,000 lines of code, their entire code base, about a million</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1C_5cbKd5E&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">tokens, dropped it all into the prompt, and then just asked if it spotted any common bugs. And he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1C_5cbKd5E&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">said it found six, like non-trivial bugs in the code base.

And I want to explore two quotes that, you know, I came across recently,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1C_5cbKd5E&t=782" target="_blank">00:13:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">both from interviews that I think get to this point. And I want to try to break those down a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1C_5cbKd5E&t=788" target="_blank">00:13:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">little bit for where we go from here. But the first was from Jensen Huang. And he said, "You</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1C_5cbKd5E&t=796" target="_blank">00:13:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">have to redefine the way you think about the traditional sources of demand for data centers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1C_5cbKd5E&t=801" target="_blank">00:13:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and compute.

Now, the immediate reaction to this and to the quote from Sam Altman,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1C_5cbKd5E&t=813" target="_blank">00:13:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to read here in a second, is of course, Jensen's going to say that he's talking his book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1C_5cbKd5E&t=818" target="_blank">00:13:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?

There's no</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1C_5cbKd5E&t=826" target="_blank">00:13:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">need to talk his book.

And it turns out coding is a subset of... And an even better subset of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1C_5cbKd5E&t=921" target="_blank">00:15:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">structured language, because it's more structured than language itself. And so, LLMs are very,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1C_5cbKd5E&t=928" target="_blank">00:15:28.560</a></span> | <span class="t">very, very good at coding.

So, LLMs work really well against things that are language intensive.

And when I look at the commoditization of models, it seems to me that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1C_5cbKd5E&t=1137" target="_blank">00:18:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">apart from the people who are on the very frontier, if you're on the frontier, and you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1C_5cbKd5E&t=1142" target="_blank">00:19:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">have something totally different, it seems to me that that's a place where that is defensible.

I think part of what people are doing is extrapolating the feeling they had</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1C_5cbKd5E&t=1199" target="_blank">00:19:59.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the first time they used chat GPT or the first time they had to write a letter, you know, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1C_5cbKd5E&t=1205" target="_blank">00:20:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">it just had this magical appeal to it.

And then he he addressed this question of why are people skeptical of demand? I would say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1C_5cbKd5E&t=1407" target="_blank">00:23:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">you're skeptical of demand.

I'm still in the camp that we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1C_5cbKd5E&t=3143" target="_blank">00:52:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">going to have rate cuts ahead of the election.

I think we had bottomed at 3.5. So that's adding more restrictiveness</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1C_5cbKd5E&t=3159" target="_blank">00:52:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to the economy. The markets, particularly high growth stocks, are starting to sell off again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1C_5cbKd5E&t=3165" target="_blank">00:52:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Stocks that are levered are starting to sell off again. And so when we started the year,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1C_5cbKd5E&t=3171" target="_blank">00:52:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I think one of the big debates, we covered the AI debate, whether or not we had pulled</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1C_5cbKd5E&t=3176" target="_blank">00:52:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">forward all the demand for training, whether or not these stocks had gotten ahead of themselves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1C_5cbKd5E&t=3180" target="_blank">00:53:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But there was a second question. Are we going to be able to avoid a recession?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1C_5cbKd5E&t=3185" target="_blank">00:53:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">How many rate cuts we'd get? When would we get those rate cuts at the start of the year?

And so I think, as I read the tea leaves, I see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1C_5cbKd5E&t=3197" target="_blank">00:53:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">pockets of weakness in the economy, particularly if you look at housing, autos. Tesla really missed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1C_5cbKd5E&t=3204" target="_blank">00:53:24.240</a></span> | <span class="t">their number today in terms of new cars shipped in the quarter. Some of that has to do with China,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1C_5cbKd5E&t=3209" target="_blank">00:53:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">but it also has to do with demand here. So I think that that's worthy of watching.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1C_5cbKd5E&t=3214" target="_blank">00:53:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I've got three charts that we spend time looking at. One is a Morgan Stanley chart.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1C_5cbKd5E&t=3220" target="_blank">00:53:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first chart is the hedge fund net exposure. So this is how many of their dollars</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1C_5cbKd5E&t=3229" target="_blank">00:53:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">they have invested on the long side of the market in a particular sector. So this is in technology.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1C_5cbKd5E&t=3236" target="_blank">00:53:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can see that in October of '21 or the end of '21, the MAG 7 or TMT X, the MAG 7 had become</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1C_5cbKd5E&t=3245" target="_blank">00:54:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">31% of its book. So what is that? That's technology if you exclude the largest names. And now that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1C_5cbKd5E&t=3251" target="_blank">00:54:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">down to something like 19%. And so hedge funds are starting to pull back a little bit on that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1C_5cbKd5E&t=3258" target="_blank">00:54:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">part of the risk curve to your point as to whether things are getting a little too bubbly, Bill.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1C_5cbKd5E&t=3263" target="_blank">00:54:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">The next one is people have seen this a lot.

You can see that in the blue line is it's trading at about 6.1</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1C_5cbKd5E&t=3276" target="_blank">00:54:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">times.

And then the final chart, because I knew you would ask me, I just asked the team to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1C_5cbKd5E&t=3322" target="_blank">00:55:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">pull together, get rid of Tesla out of the index, show me the MAG-6 index. So I just want to see the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1C_5cbKd5E&t=3328" target="_blank">00:55:28.560</a></span> | <span class="t">multiples for that relative to interest rates. And there again, you can see the 10-year average</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1C_5cbKd5E&t=3334" target="_blank">00:55:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">has been about 22 times. And so that is trading up. All of these companies have re-rated a bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1C_5cbKd5E&t=3340" target="_blank">00:55:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And the interesting thing here is if you look, you had like a reverse correlation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1C_5cbKd5E&t=3347" target="_blank">00:55:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">between these two things, which is what you would expect up until about March of '22,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1C_5cbKd5E&t=3354" target="_blank">00:55:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">where rates kept going up, but the multiple expanded on this group of companies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1C_5cbKd5E&t=3361" target="_blank">00:56:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And so some people would say, hey, that's a warning sign, right?
