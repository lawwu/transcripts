href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So why is this the case?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.900</a></span> | <span class="t">A common symptom that a lot of people experience as they're working with generative AI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.060</a></span> | <span class="t">applications is, my app worked while prototyping, but it failed the moment I tried shipping</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.160</a></span> |

moment someone else tried testing this, it just behaved very unreliably.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But the root cause of this symptom is that machine learning is fundamentally non-deterministic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.740</a></span> | <span class="t">For those of you, we're going to dig deeper into what that really means.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm guessing that a lot of you here have worked with traditional software systems before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you think about a database and querying a database to get a question about how much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">was the spend of X user over the last month.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Every single time you hit that database API, you are going to get what is the correct response.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And correct really means representative of whatever your true data actually is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is completely irrespective of uptime and availability, et cetera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">This fundamental property allows you to really build these really complex software systems which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">are in the same way for our world today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.720</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you think about machine learning model APIs, this is not really the case.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.140</a></span>

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.460</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of you that have worked with generative AI systems and LLMs in the past, you'll see that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.460</a></span> | <span class="t">even if you ask the same question across multiple times in a row, you're going to end up seeing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.860</a></span> | <span class="t">different responses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And because of this, being able to build these really complex systems that talk to each other,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.180</a></span> | <span class="t">that rely on previous outputs, et cetera, becomes harder.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Because you have this issue of compounding errors that really kind of explodes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">This is just diving deeper into the problem a little bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.500</a></span> | <span class="t">A lot of common issues as you work with these problems, hallucinations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a very buzzwordy thing that a lot of us here are familiar with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's a lot of other issues like correct structure, their vulnerability to prompt injections.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And all of this is exacerbated by the fact that unlike all other previous generations of programming,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.220</a></span> | <span class="t">the only tool that is really available to you is English.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.040</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just the prompt that you can really work with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So we end up in the scenario right now and in the current time that we're in where use of LLMs is limited wherever correctness is really critical.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.540</a></span> | <span class="t">I love GitHub Copilot, it's on my badge as my favorite tool, but if GitHub Copilot is wrong, you just ignore it and move on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Same as ChatGPT, the chat interface is really, really great because it's iterative, and you can give it feedback, and if it's incorrect, you can tell it why it's incorrect, and it can maybe give you something that's more appropriate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.540</a></span> | <span class="t">But this is not the use case for a lot of really high value critical applications.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And so how do we add correctness guarantees to LLMs while still retaining their flexible nature that really allows them to adapt so well to so many tasks?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm going to add this quick quote here by Alex Gravely, who is the creator of GitHub Copilot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=356" target="_blank">00:05:56.540</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a very simple idea, which is that add a constraint checker to check for valid generation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.540</a></span> | <span class="t">On violation, inject what was generated and the rule violation and regenerate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So once again, we're trying to think about how programming paradigms change as we're working with this fundamentally non-deterministic technology.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=377" target="_blank">00:06:17.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is something that wasn't needed for the longest time because we're working with deterministic systems, but becomes very relevant now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=385" target="_blank">00:06:25.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So interestingly, this tweet was actually pretty recent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=389" target="_blank">00:06:29.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But Guardrails AI, the open source framework that implements this and kind of like builds a framework around this strategy, has existed for a little while longer from the beginning of this year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So Guardrails acts as a safety firewall around your LLMs, and this kind of fundamentally introduces a novel paradigm that, once again, wasn't as necessary in the previous generations of software development.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=418" target="_blank">00:06:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is what a lot of the software development architectures for applications that you might build may look like, where you have some application, and then in that application you have a prompt that gets sent to an LLM, and then you end up getting some output or some response back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=437" target="_blank">00:07:17.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is the new paradigm that we propose, and that Guardrails kind of implements as a framework, wherein every output that you get back passes through a verification suite.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=449" target="_blank">00:07:29.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And that verification suite looks at all of the functional areas of, you know, inconsistencies or risks that you are really sensitive to as an application builder, which may be very, very different from, you know, if you're building a code generation application, whereas if you're building, like, a healthcare chatbot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=466" target="_blank">00:07:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So maybe, like, containing PII or PHI, like, sensitive information might be something you want to check against, or profanity filtering that out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=476" target="_blank">00:07:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're building a commercial application, you might really care about the fact that there's no mention of any competitors, like, if you're building a McDonald's chatbot, like, nobody should be able to get your chatbot to say that Burger King's the best burger in town.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=489" target="_blank">00:08:09.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So, making sure that any code that you generate is executable within your environment, as well as, you know, summarization or free-form text generation is true and grounded in the source that you know to be, you know, correct, and not just hallucinated from the model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=505" target="_blank">00:08:25.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So, each of these ends up being an independent check that runs as part of this, like, comprehensive verification suite that allows you to build trust in the models and the ML applications that you're building.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=518" target="_blank">00:08:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So, the paradigm that we propose is that only use large language model outputs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=524" target="_blank">00:08:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">If your verification suite passes on failure, you can really hook into this very powerful capability that LLMs unleash, which is, you know, their ability to, like, self-heal, which is that if you tell them why they're wrong, they can often correct themselves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=539" target="_blank">00:08:59.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can kind of go through this loop again if you have the, you know, latency budget or even the dollar budget or the token budget to implement this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=549" target="_blank">00:09:09.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to, like, go over this very briefly, but under the hood how Guardrails does this is that it allows you to create what we call guards from, you know, different inputs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=560" target="_blank">00:09:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you can use, like, either a declarative model spec, such as, like, you know, like XML or rail.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=567" target="_blank">00:09:27.480</a></span> | <span class="t">You can use pydantic models that implement, like, specific validation criteria and structure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=573" target="_blank">00:09:33.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Or you can use string implementation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=575" target="_blank">00:09:35.480</a></span> | <span class="t">You can create a guard from all of these components.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=578" target="_blank">00:09:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">If you want, you can add information about, you know, your prompt as well as the LLMs you want to use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=583" target="_blank">00:09:43.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you create this at initialization.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=587" target="_blank">00:09:47.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But at runtime, this guard will basically surround your LLM callable and then make sure that everything that you're sending in or getting out of the LLM is valid and correct for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=598" target="_blank">00:09:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=599" target="_blank">00:09:59.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So, for example, if your output is valid, you end up sending the output back to your application.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=604" target="_blank">00:10:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But if it's invalid, you go through this loop of looking at which constraint is violated or which check is violated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=613" target="_blank">00:10:13.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And then if on violation, you have a set of these policies including, like, re-asking, which we touched on earlier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=620" target="_blank">00:10:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Filtering or fixing, which is programmatically trying to correct output.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=625" target="_blank">00:10:25.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Falling back on some other system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=628" target="_blank">00:10:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So refraining from answering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=630" target="_blank">00:10:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Or, you know, just no-op where you don't actively take an action, but you log and store what the outputs of those checks or verification was and, like, why that particular check failed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=642" target="_blank">00:10:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you only do this, like, on -- you only return the output once you know you can trust whatever came out of the LLM.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=649" target="_blank">00:10:49.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So within this framework, what Guardrails.ai does is it's a fully open source library that allows you to, A, create custom validators.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=661" target="_blank">00:11:01.480</a></span> | <span class="t">It orchestrates the whole validation and verification process for you to make sure that, you know, you're not taking on this, like, really kind of, like, often latency-intensive task of doing validation and make sure that it's done as efficiently as possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=676" target="_blank">00:11:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a library and a catalog of many, many commonly used validators across a bunch of use cases.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=683" target="_blank">00:11:23.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's a specification language that allows you to compile your requirements into a prompt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=689" target="_blank">00:11:29.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So that, like, whatever specific validators you want to use are automatically turned into a prompt so that you know that, you know, those requirements are also being communicated to the LLM.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=703" target="_blank">00:11:43.480</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, so a common question, why do I need this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=706" target="_blank">00:11:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Why can't I just use prompt engineering or, you know, a better fine-tuned model?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=710" target="_blank">00:11:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So, okay, so for some reason my rendering here is weird.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=717" target="_blank">00:11:57.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But controlling the outputs with prompts, including using retrieval augmented generation, which basically injects specific context into your prompt, doesn't act as a guarantee, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=729" target="_blank">00:12:09.480</a></span> | <span class="t">LLMs are stochastic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=731" target="_blank">00:12:11.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Even if you do all the prompt engineering in the world, there's nothing guaranteeing that those instructions will be followed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=738" target="_blank">00:12:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">We actually did this as an experiment for an unrelated thing where we used LLMs as evaluators.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=744" target="_blank">00:12:24.480</a></span> | <span class="t">We ran the exact same experiment five different times, changing, like, absolutely zero parameters with zero temperature and saw, like, different numbers across our benchmark, which is, you know, really fascinating and wouldn't really fly in, like, previous generations of machine learning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=759" target="_blank">00:12:39.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And then second, prompts don't offer any guarantees.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=764" target="_blank">00:12:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">LLMs don't, you know, always follow instructions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=768" target="_blank">00:12:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">The alternative is also, like, controlling the outputs with models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=772" target="_blank">00:12:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So, first of all, it is very expensive and time-consuming to train a model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=777" target="_blank">00:12:57.480</a></span> | <span class="t">In my past life, this was basically what I've done my whole life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=781" target="_blank">00:13:01.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was so frustrated with this whole process as I joined a startup where my job was to make this, you know, this process easier, like, as a function.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=789" target="_blank">00:13:09.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But it still requires, like, you know, compiling a lot of data set, which is expensive, training a model over a bunch of hyperparameters, and then serving it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=799" target="_blank">00:13:19.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And then if you aren't doing that and you're using, like, an LLM that's hidden behind a commercial API, you typically don't have any control over model version updates.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=810" target="_blank">00:13:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So I've kind of seen this where, you know, I mentioned, like, validations get compiled into prompts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=816" target="_blank">00:13:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So I've kind of, like, observed where commercial models will get updated under the hood.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=821" target="_blank">00:13:41.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And so prompts that might have worked for you in the past will stop working just over time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=826" target="_blank">00:13:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So how do these guardrails work under the hood, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=832" target="_blank">00:13:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">There's no, like, one-stop-shop solution for a guardrail here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=838" target="_blank">00:13:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">It really depends on the type of problem that you're solving.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=842" target="_blank">00:14:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So a very reliable way, if possible, for implementing a guardrail is to ground it in an external system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=850" target="_blank">00:14:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's say you're working in a code generation app.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=853" target="_blank">00:14:13.480</a></span> | <span class="t">A really good way to generate more reliable code is to actually hook up the output of the LLM into a runtime that basically contains application-specific data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=863" target="_blank">00:14:23.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So we tried it for a lot of text-to-SQL applications, which is something that is supported as a first-class citizen in guardrails.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=871" target="_blank">00:14:31.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And we found that this re-asking framework, where you hook it up to, you know, a sandbox that contains your database and your schema,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=879" target="_blank">00:14:39.480</a></span> | <span class="t">really substantially improved the correctness of the SQL queries that you got.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=884" target="_blank">00:14:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">You can also use rule-based heuristics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=888" target="_blank">00:14:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So really looking into, like, OK, if I'm, let's say, trying to extract an interest rate from a really long document,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=895" target="_blank">00:14:55.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I always must know that interest rates, you know, end with, like, percentage signs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=899" target="_blank">00:14:59.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that can be a clue that I must always be retrieving.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=902" target="_blank">00:15:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">You can try to use, like, traditional machine learning methods or high-precision deep learning classifiers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=908" target="_blank">00:15:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So really you don't need the full power of an LLM to solve, you know, really basic constraints.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=914" target="_blank">00:15:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So trying to find, like, is there some type of toxicity in this output?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=919" target="_blank">00:15:19.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Does some type of output contain, you know, advice that is harmful for my users or is misleading my users in some way?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=926" target="_blank">00:15:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">You don't need-- my favorite analogy to use is you don't need, like, a jackhammer to crack open a walnut.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=932" target="_blank">00:15:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So if possible, you know, some of the guardrails should use, like, smaller classifiers that are much more reliable and deterministic instead of, you know, using LLMs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=942" target="_blank">00:15:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And then finally you can also use LLM self-reflection.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=947" target="_blank">00:15:47.480</a></span> | <span class="t">All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=948" target="_blank">00:15:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're going to walk through this example of how this works in practice for building a chatbot where you want to generate correct responses always.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=958" target="_blank">00:15:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's say you're an organization that has certain help center articles and you want to make sure that you always generate-- you know, your users can ask questions over those help center articles in a chatbot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=971" target="_blank">00:16:11.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And you always generate, like, correct responses where correctness means no hallucinations, not using any foul language, so don't swear at your customers, and never mention any competitors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=986" target="_blank">00:16:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, how do you really prevent hallucinations?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=989" target="_blank">00:16:29.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, that's a very fundamental question, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=992" target="_blank">00:16:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Providence guardrails.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=995" target="_blank">00:16:35.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Providence guardrails essentially mean that every LLM utterance should have some leaning in a source of truth, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=1004" target="_blank">00:16:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Especially if you're building, like, retrieval augmented generation applications.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=1008" target="_blank">00:16:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">You make the assumption that, okay, I gave it this context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=1011" target="_blank">00:16:51.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I hope it's using the context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=1013" target="_blank">00:16:53.480</a></span> | <span class="t">What you want to make sure is that every output that is generated, you're able to pinpoint to where in the context, you know, your response kind of came from.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=1021" target="_blank">00:17:01.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is one of the guardrails that, you know, exists in our catalog of guardrails.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=1026" target="_blank">00:17:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Under the hood, there's a few different techniques that we employ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=1029" target="_blank">00:17:09.480</a></span> | <span class="t">We use embedding similarity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=1031" target="_blank">00:17:11.480</a></span> | <span class="t">We also have, like, classifiers that are built on traditional NLI, like, natural language inference models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=1037" target="_blank">00:17:17.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And we use LLM self-reflection.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=1040" target="_blank">00:17:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a very brief, you know, snippet of, like, how to configure a guard, where you can essentially, like, select from this catalog which guardrails you want to use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=1052" target="_blank">00:17:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So we've used provenance, profanity, no references to peer or competitor institutions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=1058" target="_blank">00:17:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you essentially wrap your LLM call with, you know, the guard that you've created.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=1065" target="_blank">00:17:45.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So very briefly, let's say you get some question which is, like, how do I change my password on your application?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=1071" target="_blank">00:17:51.480</a></span> | <span class="t">You have, like, some prompt that, you know, is constructed from your retrieval augmented generation application.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=1077" target="_blank">00:17:57.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But because LLMs are very, very prone to hallucinating, there's, like, it hallucinates where the setting exists for you in your, you know, in the response.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=1087" target="_blank">00:18:07.480</a></span> | <span class="t">When this passes through your verification suite, the provenance guardrail will essentially spike and will cause the LLM to, you know, like, go through this, like, re-asking loop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=1097" target="_blank">00:18:17.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Where a re-ask prompt will automatically be constructed for you via guardrails, which will, like, pinpoint which part is hallucinated, give it the context again, and ask it to correct itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=1109" target="_blank">00:18:29.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And then finally, the re-ask output, you know, it tends to be more correct.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=1113" target="_blank">00:18:33.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we can kind of see here in this toy example that the output is, you know, corrected for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=1118" target="_blank">00:18:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And finally, verification passes, and you can send this back to the output.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=1123" target="_blank">00:18:43.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Very briefly, more examples of validators that you can create or that exist.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=1128" target="_blank">00:18:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Never giving any financial or healthcare advice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=1130" target="_blank">00:18:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Making sure that any code that you generate is usable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=1133" target="_blank">00:18:53.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Never asking any private questions from your customers or mentioning competitors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=1137" target="_blank">00:18:57.480</a></span> | <span class="t">No profanity, prompt injection, et cetera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=1141" target="_blank">00:19:01.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And then just to summarize what guardrails does for you, custom validations, orchestration of verification,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-vGxMoUM9Y&t=1147"
