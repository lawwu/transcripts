And I think one of the most fundamentally interesting things about it is that it shows</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=122">00:02:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that each of us takes the journey from so-called just physics to mind, right? Because we all start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=127">00:02:07.600</a></span> | <span class="t">life as a single quiescent, unfertilized oocyte, and it's basically a bag of chemicals, and you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=133">00:02:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">look at that and you say, "Okay, this is chemistry and physics." And then nine months and some years</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=137">00:02:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">later, you have an organism with high-level cognition and preferences and an inner life</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=142">00:02:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and so on. And what embryogenesis tells us is that that transformation from physics to mind is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=147">00:02:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">gradual.

That doesn't happen. And so we can see in this process that the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=158">00:02:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">whole mystery, the biggest mystery of the universe, basically, how you get mind from matter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=163">00:02:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">- From just physics in quotes.

Because what you might assume by looking at the thing about embryogenesis</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=404">00:06:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is that it's super reliable, right? It's very robust. And that really obscures some of its most</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=409">00:06:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">interesting features. We get used to it. We get used to the fact that acorns make oak trees and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=413">00:06:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">frog eggs make frogs. And we say, "Well, what else is it going to make?" That's what it makes. That's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=417">00:06:57.120</a></span> | <span class="t">a standard story. But the reality is... And so you look at these skin cells and you say, "Well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=423">00:07:03.520</a></span> | <span class="t">what do they know how to do?" Well, they know how to be a passive, boring, two-dimensional outer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=427">00:07:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">layer keeping the bacteria from getting into the embryo. That's what they know how to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=430">00:07:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, it turns out that if you take these skin cells and you remove the rest of the embryo,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=435">00:07:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">so you remove all of the rest of the cells and you say, "Well, you're by yourself now. What do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=440">00:07:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you want to do?" So what they do is they form this multi-little creature that runs around the dish.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=445">00:07:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">They have all kinds of incredible capacities.

They have various</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=450">00:07:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">behaviors that they do both independently and together. Basically, they implement von Neumann's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=457">00:07:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">dream of self-replication. Because if you sprinkle a bunch of loose cells into the dish, what they do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=461">00:07:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">is they run around, they collect those cells into little piles. They sort of mush them together</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=466">00:07:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">until those little piles become the next generation of xenobots. So you've got this machine that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=470">00:07:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">builds copies of itself from loose material in its environment. None of this are things that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=475">00:07:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">would have expected from the frog genome. In fact, the genome is wild-type. There's nothing wrong</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=480">00:08:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">with their genetics.

What you've done is you've removed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=490">00:08:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the other cells that normally basically bully these cells into being skin cells. And you find</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=494">00:08:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">out that what they really want to do is to be this... Their default behavior is to be a xenobot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=500">00:08:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But in vivo, in the embryo, they get told to be skinned by these other cell types.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=505">00:08:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so now here comes this really interesting question that you just posed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=510">00:08:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">When you ask where does the form of the tadpole and the frog come from, the standard answer is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=515">00:08:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">well, it's selection.

Amniote embryos,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=1524">00:25:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">so this is humans, birds, and so on, mammals and birds, and so on. Imagine a flat disk of cells,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=1530">00:25:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">so there's maybe 50,000 cells.

Okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=1703">00:28:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">so everything I'm telling you is cutting edge, developing stuff.

I don't think that evolution produces</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=1716">00:28:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">solutions to specific problems.

Like here's a frog that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=1720">00:28:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">can live well in a froggy environment. I think what evolution produces is problem solving machines</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=1726">00:28:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that will solve problems in different spaces.

That system evolved from a much more ancient,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=1746">00:29:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">evolutionarily much more ancient system where collections of cells gave instructions for cell</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=1752">00:29:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">behaviors, meaning cells move to divide, to die, to change into different cell types,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=1758">00:29:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to navigate morphous space, the space of anatomies, the space of all possible anatomies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=1763">00:29:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And before that, cells were navigating transcriptional space, which is a space</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=1767">00:29:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">of all possible gene expressions.

I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8273">02:17:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">mean, we can already do bladders and ears and things like that because it's micro-level control.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8278">02:17:58.240</a></span> | <span class="t">When you 3D print, you are in charge of where every cell goes. And for some things,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8281">02:18:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">for like this thing, they had that, I think, 20 years ago or maybe earlier than that, you could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8286">02:18:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">do that. So yeah, I would like to emphasize the Dali part where you provide a few words</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8291">02:18:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and it generates a painting.

The main magic would be, I mean, I think from looking at Dali and so on, it looks like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8310">02:18:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the first part is kind of solved now where you go from the words to the image. Like that seems more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8314">02:18:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">or less solved. The next step is really hard. This is what keeps things like CRISPR and genomic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8321">02:18:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">editing and so on.

We did something like this for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8404">02:20:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">repairing birth defects of the brain in frog.

The biological system has that information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8442">02:20:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So how does regenerative medicine work today? How do you hope it works? What's the hope there?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8449">02:20:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">How do you make it happen?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8451">02:20:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, today there's a set of popular approaches. So one is 3D printing. So the idea is I'm going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8457">02:20:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to make a scaffold of the thing that I want. I'm going to seed it with cells and then there it is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8461">02:21:01.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? So kind of direct, and then that works for certain things. You can make a bladder that way,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8465">02:21:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">or an ear, something like that. The other idea is some sort of stem cell transplant. The idea is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8472">02:21:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">if we put in stem cells with appropriate factors, we can get them to generate certain kinds of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8477">02:21:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">neurons for certain diseases and so on. All of those things are good for relatively simple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8483">02:21:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">structures, but when you want an eye or a hand or something else, I think, and this may be an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8489">02:21:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">unpopular opinion, I think the only hope we have in any reasonable kind of timeframe is to understand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8496">02:21:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">how the thing was motivated to get made in the first place. So what is it that made those cells</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8501">02:21:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">in the beginning create a particular arm with a particular set of sizes and shapes and number</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8508">02:21:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">of fingers and all that? And why is it that a salamander can keep losing theirs and keep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8511">02:21:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">regrowing theirs and a planarian can do the same, even more so? To me, kind of ultimate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8518">02:21:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">regenerative medicine was when you can tell the cells to build whatever it is you need them to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8523">02:22:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">build. Right? And so that we can all be like planaria, basically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8527">02:22:07.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you have to start at the very beginning or can you do a shortcut? Because if you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8533">02:22:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">growing a hand, you already got the whole organism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8537">02:22:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So here's what we've done, right? So we've more or less solved that in frogs. So frogs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8542">02:22:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">unlike salamanders, do not regenerate their legs as adults. And so we've shown that with a very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8548">02:22:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of simple intervention. So what we do is there's two things. You need to have a signal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8556">02:22:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">that tells the cells what to do, and then you need some way of delivering it. And so this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8560">02:22:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">worked together with David Kaplan. And I should do a disclosure here. We have a company called</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8564">02:22:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Morphoceuticals, I think it's a spin-off, where we're trying to address limb regeneration. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8571">02:22:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">we've solved it in the frog and we're now in trials in mice. So now we're in mammals now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8575">02:22:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I can't say anything about how it's going, but the frog thing is solved. So what you do is after-</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8579">02:22:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You can have a little frog Lou Skywalker with every growing hand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8583">02:23:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, basically. So what you do is we did with legs instead of forearms. And what you do is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8588">02:23:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">after amputation, normally they don't regenerate, you put on a wearable bioreactor. So it's this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8593">02:23:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">thing that goes on and Dave Kaplan's lab makes these things. And inside, it's a very controlled</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8600">02:23:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">environment. It is a silk gel that carries some drugs, for example, ion channel drugs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8605">02:23:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And what you're doing is you're saying to these cells, "You should regrow what normally goes here."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8611">02:23:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So that whole thing is on for 24 hours. Then you take it off and you don't touch the leg again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8617">02:23:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">This is really important because what we're not looking for is a set of micromanagement,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8622">02:23:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">printing or controlling the cells. We want to trigger. We want to interact with it early on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8626">02:23:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and then not touch it again, because we don't know how to make a frog leg, but the frog knows</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8630">02:23:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">how to make a frog leg. So 24 hours, 18 months of leg growth after that, without us touching it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8636">02:23:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">again. And after 18 months, you get a pretty good leg. That kind of shows this proof of concept that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8641">02:24:01.520</a></span> | <span class="t">early on when the cells, right after injury, when they're first making a decision about what they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8645">02:24:05.040</a></span> | <span class="t">going to do, you can impact them. And once they've decided to make a leg, they don't need you after</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8649">02:24:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">that. They can do their own thing. So that's an approach that we're now taking. - What about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8654">02:24:14.240</a></span> | <span class="t">cancer suppression? That's something you mentioned earlier. How can all of these ideas help with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8659">02:24:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">cancer suppression? - So let's go back to the beginning and ask what cancer is. So I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8665">02:24:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">asking why there's cancer is the wrong question. I think the right question is, why is there ever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8669">02:24:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">anything but cancer? So in the normal state, you have a bunch of cells that are all cooperating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8675">02:24:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">towards a large scale goal. If that process of cooperation breaks down and you've got a cell</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8680">02:24:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that is isolated from that electrical network that lets you remember what the big goal is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8684">02:24:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you revert back to your unicellular lifestyle. Now think about that border between self and world,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8689">02:24:49.840</a></span> | <span class="t">right? Normally when all these cells are connected by gap junctions into an electrical network,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8694">02:24:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">they are all one self, right? Meaning that their goals, they have these large tissue level goals</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8701">02:25:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and so on. As soon as a cell is disconnected from that, the self is tiny, right? And so at that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8706">02:25:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">point, and so a lot of people model cancer cells as being more selfish and all that. They're not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8712">02:25:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">more selfish. They're equally selfish. It's just that their self is smaller. Normally the self is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8715">02:25:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">huge. Now they've got tiny little selves. Now what are the goals of tiny little selves? Well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8719">02:25:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">proliferate and migrate to wherever life is good. And that's metastasis. That's proliferation and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8724">02:25:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">metastasis. So one thing we found, and people have noticed years ago that when cells convert to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8730">02:25:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">cancer, the first thing they see is they close the gap junctions.
