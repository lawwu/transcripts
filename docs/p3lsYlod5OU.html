And I think one of the most fundamentally interesting things about it is that it shows</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that each of us takes the journey from so-called just physics to mind, right? Because we all start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.600</a></span> | <span class="t">life as a single quiescent, unfertilized oocyte, and it's basically a bag of chemicals, and you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">look at that and you say, "Okay, this is chemistry and physics." And then nine months and some years</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">later, you have an organism with high-level cognition and preferences and an inner life</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and so on. And what embryogenesis tells us is that that transformation from physics to mind is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">gradual.

That doesn't happen. And so we can see in this process that the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">whole mystery, the biggest mystery of the universe, basically, how you get mind from matter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">- From just physics in quotes.

I think that we really have to understand that it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">a continuum and we have to work up the scaling, the laws of scaling.

How come, right? So we did a very simple thing, and we said, okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=4306" target="_blank">01:11:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">let's make the hypothesis that there's a somatic electrical network that remembers the correct</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=4312" target="_blank">01:11:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">pattern, and that what it's doing is recalling that memory and building to that pattern. So what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=4316" target="_blank">01:11:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">we did was we used a way to visualize electrical activity in these cells, right?

It has a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=4333" target="_blank">01:12:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">very particular electrical pattern that shows you where the head and the tail goes, right? You can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=4338" target="_blank">01:12:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">just see it. And then we said, okay, well, now let's test the idea that that's a memory that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=4342" target="_blank">01:12:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">actually controls where the head and the tail goes.

One way is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=4350" target="_blank">01:12:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">with drugs that target ion channels to say, and so you pick these drugs and you say, okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=4355" target="_blank">01:12:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to do it so that instead of this one head, one tail electrical pattern,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=4360" target="_blank">01:12:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you have a two-headed pattern, right?

The main magic would be, I mean, I think from looking at Dali and so on, it looks like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8310" target="_blank">02:18:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the first part is kind of solved now where you go from the words to the image. Like that seems more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8314" target="_blank">02:18:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">or less solved. The next step is really hard. This is what keeps things like CRISPR and genomic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8321" target="_blank">02:18:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">editing and so on. This is what limits all the impacts for regenerative medicine because going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8328" target="_blank">02:18:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">back to, "Okay, this is the knee joint that I want," or, "This is the eye that I want.

Right? Going back in that direction is really hard. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8337" target="_blank">02:18:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">instead of that, it's going to be, "Okay, I understand how to motivate cells to build particular</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8341" target="_blank">02:19:01.520</a></span> | <span class="t">structures.

The biological system has that information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8442" target="_blank">02:20:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So how does regenerative medicine work today? How do you hope it works? What's the hope there?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8449" target="_blank">02:20:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">How do you make it happen?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8451" target="_blank">02:20:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, today there's a set of popular approaches. So one is 3D printing. So the idea is I'm going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8457" target="_blank">02:20:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to make a scaffold of the thing that I want. I'm going to seed it with cells and then there it is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8461" target="_blank">02:21:01.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? So kind of direct, and then that works for certain things. You can make a bladder that way,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8465" target="_blank">02:21:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">or an ear, something like that. The other idea is some sort of stem cell transplant. The idea is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8472" target="_blank">02:21:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">if we put in stem cells with appropriate factors, we can get them to generate certain kinds of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8477" target="_blank">02:21:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">neurons for certain diseases and so on. All of those things are good for relatively simple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8483" target="_blank">02:21:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">structures, but when you want an eye or a hand or something else, I think, and this may be an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8489" target="_blank">02:21:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">unpopular opinion, I think the only hope we have in any reasonable kind of timeframe is to understand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8496" target="_blank">02:21:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">how the thing was motivated to get made in the first place. So what is it that made those cells</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8501" target="_blank">02:21:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">in the beginning create a particular arm with a particular set of sizes and shapes and number</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8508" target="_blank">02:21:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">of fingers and all that? And why is it that a salamander can keep losing theirs and keep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8511" target="_blank">02:21:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">regrowing theirs and a planarian can do the same, even more so? To me, kind of ultimate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8518" target="_blank">02:21:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">regenerative medicine was when you can tell the cells to build whatever it is you need them to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8523" target="_blank">02:22:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">build. Right? And so that we can all be like planaria, basically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8527" target="_blank">02:22:07.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you have to start at the very beginning or can you do a shortcut? Because if you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8533" target="_blank">02:22:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">growing a hand, you already got the whole organism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8537" target="_blank">02:22:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So here's what we've done, right? So we've more or less solved that in frogs. So frogs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8542" target="_blank">02:22:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">unlike salamanders, do not regenerate their legs as adults. And so we've shown that with a very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8548" target="_blank">02:22:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of simple intervention. So what we do is there's two things. You need to have a signal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8556" target="_blank">02:22:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">that tells the cells what to do, and then you need some way of delivering it. And so this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8560" target="_blank">02:22:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">worked together with David Kaplan. And I should do a disclosure here. We have a company called</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8564" target="_blank">02:22:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Morphoceuticals, I think it's a spin-off, where we're trying to address limb regeneration. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8571" target="_blank">02:22:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">we've solved it in the frog and we're now in trials in mice. So now we're in mammals now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8575" target="_blank">02:22:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I can't say anything about how it's going, but the frog thing is solved. So what you do is after-</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8579" target="_blank">02:22:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You can have a little frog Lou Skywalker with every growing hand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8583" target="_blank">02:23:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, basically. So what you do is we did with legs instead of forearms. And what you do is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8588" target="_blank">02:23:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">after amputation, normally they don't regenerate, you put on a wearable bioreactor. So it's this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8593" target="_blank">02:23:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">thing that goes on and Dave Kaplan's lab makes these things. And inside, it's a very controlled</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8600" target="_blank">02:23:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">environment. It is a silk gel that carries some drugs, for example, ion channel drugs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8605" target="_blank">02:23:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And what you're doing is you're saying to these cells, "You should regrow what normally goes here."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8611" target="_blank">02:23:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So that whole thing is on for 24 hours. Then you take it off and you don't touch the leg again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8617" target="_blank">02:23:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">This is really important because what we're not looking for is a set of micromanagement,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8622" target="_blank">02:23:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">printing or controlling the cells. We want to trigger. We want to interact with it early on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8626" target="_blank">02:23:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and then not touch it again, because we don't know how to make a frog leg, but the frog knows</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8630" target="_blank">02:23:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">how to make a frog leg.

And after 18 months, you get a pretty good leg. That kind of shows this proof of concept that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8641" target="_blank">02:24:01.520</a></span> | <span class="t">early on when the cells, right after injury, when they're first making a decision about what they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8645" target="_blank">02:24:05.040</a></span> | <span class="t">going to do, you can impact them. And once they've decided to make a leg, they don't need you after</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8649" target="_blank">02:24:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">that. They can do their own thing. So that's an approach that we're now taking. - What about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8654" target="_blank">02:24:14.240</a></span> | <span class="t">cancer suppression? That's something you mentioned earlier. How can all of these ideas help with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8659" target="_blank">02:24:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">cancer suppression? - So let's go back to the beginning and ask what cancer is. So I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8665" target="_blank">02:24:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">asking why there's cancer is the wrong question. I think the right question is, why is there ever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8669" target="_blank">02:24:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">anything but cancer? So in the normal state, you have a bunch of cells that are all cooperating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8675" target="_blank">02:24:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">towards a large scale goal. If that process of cooperation breaks down and you've got a cell</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8680" target="_blank">02:24:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that is isolated from that electrical network that lets you remember what the big goal is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8684" target="_blank">02:24:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you revert back to your unicellular lifestyle. Now think about that border between self and world,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8689" target="_blank">02:24:49.840</a></span> | <span class="t">right? Normally when all these cells are connected by gap junctions into an electrical network,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8694" target="_blank">02:24:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">they are all one self, right? Meaning that their goals, they have these large tissue level goals</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8701" target="_blank">02:25:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and so on. As soon as a cell is disconnected from that, the self is tiny, right? And so at that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8706" target="_blank">02:25:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">point, and so a lot of people model cancer cells as being more selfish and all that. They're not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8712" target="_blank">02:25:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">more selfish. They're equally selfish. It's just that their self is smaller. Normally the self is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8715" target="_blank">02:25:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">huge. Now they've got tiny little selves. Now what are the goals of tiny little selves? Well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8719" target="_blank">02:25:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">proliferate and migrate to wherever life is good. And that's metastasis. That's proliferation and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8724" target="_blank">02:25:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">metastasis. So one thing we found, and people have noticed years ago that when cells convert to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=8730" target="_blank">02:25:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">cancer, the first thing they see is they close the gap junctions.

So when I do an experiment, I'm still</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=10680" target="_blank">02:58:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">me. There's the experiment, whatever I've done, I've learned something. So that's a small change,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=10683" target="_blank">02:58:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">but overall, that's it. In order to really study consciousness, you are part of the experiment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=10690" target="_blank">02:58:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">You will be altered by that experiment, right? Whatever it is that you're doing, whether it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=10694" target="_blank">02:58:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">some sort of contemplative practice or some sort of psychoactive, whatever, you are now your own</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=10703" target="_blank">02:58:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">experiment and you are right in. So I fold that in. I think that's part of it. I think that exploring</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=10709" target="_blank">02:58:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">our own mind and our own consciousness is very important. I think much of it is not captured by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=10713" target="_blank">02:58:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">what currently is third person science, for sure.
