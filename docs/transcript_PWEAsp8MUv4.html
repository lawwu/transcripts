And that's a personal card. Earns 4x on groceries and 4x on restaurants. But the grocery spend has a $25,000 a year cap. The restaurant side has a $50,000 a year cap. And then it earns 3x on flights, 1x on everything else.</p><p>It does also get 2x on prepaid hotels through Amex Travel. But again, I don't really like booking hotels in the travel portal. And especially not for one extra point. So I'll set that aside. But it's a 4x grocery, 4x dining card, 3x flights. I really like this card. This card is one that I keep in my wallet.</p><p>It is my primary dining and grocery card out there. I have other cards for more points on flights. But I'm using this a lot. The sign-up bonus right now as of recording is as high as it has ever been at 100,000 points. For $6,000 of spend in 6 months.</p><p>But for me, this is my primary card that I keep in my wallet. Because dining spend seems to be one of the few things that sometimes you need a physical card. So it's a primary bias for why I have it in my wallet. But I use it all the time.</p><p>It's an S-tier card for me. And, you know, I'm really happy with it.</p></div></div></body></html>
