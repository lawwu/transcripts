My name is Waseem. I am an entrepreneur in residence at FAST.ai and I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=10" target="_blank">00:00:10.920</a></span> | <span class="t">currently at the FAST.ai headquarters at the moment in Australia, although I'm originally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=17" target="_blank">00:00:17.240</a></span> | <span class="t">from South Africa, from Cape Town. And I'm joined here today by Tanishq. Tanishq works</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=25" target="_blank">00:00:25.080</a></span> | <span class="t">at Stability AI. And we've been working together with a couple other people on diffusion models,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=33" target="_blank">00:00:33.080</a></span> | <span class="t">generative kind of modeling. And that's been super fun. So, Tanishq, do you want to maybe,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=39" target="_blank">00:00:39.400</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, introduce yourself as well? Yeah, so my name is Tanishq. I am a PhD student</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=46" target="_blank">00:00:46.600</a></span> | <span class="t">at UC Davis, but I also work at Stability AI. And I've been exploring and playing around</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=52" target="_blank">00:00:52.560</a></span> | <span class="t">with diffusion models for the past several months. And so, it's been great to also explore</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=60" target="_blank">00:01:00.920</a></span> | <span class="t">that with the FAST.ai community as well in these last few weeks as well. Awesome. Cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=67" target="_blank">00:01:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Cool. So this talk is for me trying to understand the math behind diffusion. So, you know, if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=78" target="_blank">00:01:18.440</a></span> | <span class="t">you've done the FAST.ai courses before, you know that you don't need to understand the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=82" target="_blank">00:01:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">math to be effective with any of these models. In fact, you don't even need the math to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=88" target="_blank">00:01:28.120</a></span> | <span class="t">research, to do novel research and contribute to these. But for me, it was all about, it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.920</a></span> | <span class="t">came out of interest. And, you know, I thought it was kind of, it's kind of beautiful how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=102" target="_blank">00:01:42.140</a></span> | <span class="t">what diffusion models were discovered. And I think a large part of that was thanks to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=108" target="_blank">00:01:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">some some really clever math. And so I wanted to understand that. I'm not, I don't have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">a math background. And so I want to help kind of describe how I think about it and how I,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">how you can kind of interpret, you know, all of these notations and things. Cool. Yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">so I can just dive into it, I think. So the first bit of math that we see in this paper</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.720</a></span> | <span class="t">is Q of X superscript zero. And they call this the data distribution.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=155" target="_blank">00:02:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you want to mention what the paper, exactly which paper this is?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Good, good question. So this paper is the 2015 paper. Do you remember the authors of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">that paper, Tanish? I think it's Jasa, Sol Dikstein, who now works at Google, I think.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's from Surya Ganguly's lab. So cool. Yeah, so this was the paper, as far as I understand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that introduced this idea of diffusion. Yeah, 2015 by those authors. They start out by defining</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">this data distribution and they use this notation. And already, like a lot of people, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.080</a></span> | <span class="t">myself included, find this quite confusing. But let's go through what's described here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So they have an X. And, you know, in math, X is often used as the input variable, much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.840</a></span> | <span class="t">like Y, which is then used often as the output variable. Yeah, and the fact that it has a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.920</a></span> | <span class="t">superscript also implies something. So the fact that we have X superscript zero implies</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.360</a></span> | <span class="t">that there might be a sequence of Xs. And, you know, I think it's useful to get comfortable</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">with this idea of simple compact notations implying a lot more than, you know, might be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.760</a></span> | <span class="t">obvious at first glance. So X implies that it means something about this quantity. It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">an input variable. And, you know, the zero implies that there might be other things that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">you might have. You might have an X1, an X2, and so on, but we might see that. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the third part is you have Q. And Q is what we call a probability density function. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the first part here is probability. And the question is, you know, what does Q have to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">do with probabilities? Well, it's because usually we use the letter P to describe probability</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">density functions of interest. And then because Q is right after that, it's another common</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">one. So it's kind of like how you use X and Y. We use P and Q. And the fact that we use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Q here instead of P is because it suggests that there might be a P that we'll introduce.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And maybe P is the thing that we're modeling and Q is kind of supplementary to that. Does</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=328" target="_blank">00:05:28.040</a></span> | <span class="t">that sound right, Tanishk? Yeah, yeah. And I think it's also helpful to kind of maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=333" target="_blank">00:05:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">think about like X0 in a more practical, concrete way. Of course, if we're working with images</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">then X0 would be, you know, that's what's representing the images. So it's also useful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=345" target="_blank">00:05:45.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to think about it from kind of that concrete practical approach as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. So X0 might be, you know, an MNIST digit. And then we got Q. So Q, I'll just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">use this to mean Q is some function. So we look at it as a box. And it takes in X0 and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=379" target="_blank">00:06:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">it gives us the probability that this X0, which is an image, looks like an MNIST digit. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.360</a></span> | <span class="t">in this case, you know, this would be 0.9 or maybe even, yeah, it's 0.98. So this is quite</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=395" target="_blank">00:06:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">high probability that this is an MNIST digit. Hi, this is Jeremy. Can I jump in for a moment?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Please do. Oh, thank you. I just wanted to double check. This looks a lot like the magic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=407" target="_blank">00:06:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">API that we had at the start of lesson one that you feed in a digit and it gives you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=412" target="_blank">00:06:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">back a probability. Is that basically what Q is doing here?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=416" target="_blank">00:06:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Absolutely, yeah. It's a magic API. That's a good way to think of it. We don't know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=422" target="_blank">00:07:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">we couldn't write down what Q is, but we imagine that somebody has it somewhere. Yeah, so this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=430" target="_blank">00:07:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">is a concrete example. And like, if you had to do something to this image, you might get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=437" target="_blank">00:07:17.400</a></span> | <span class="t">a smaller number here. So another thing worth mentioning here is probability density functions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=446" target="_blank">00:07:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So these are these magic APIs that, you know, give us a number, tells us how likely the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=452" target="_blank">00:07:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">thing is. They, you don't often see them, they don't often make it all the way to your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=458" target="_blank">00:07:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">code. In fact, they very rarely will appear in your code. But it turns out that there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=465" target="_blank">00:07:45.720</a></span> | <span class="t">are very useful ways or tools to work with random quantities, because they allow you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=472" target="_blank">00:07:52.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to represent random quantities as functions, just ordinary functions. And because they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=479" target="_blank">00:07:59.800</a></span> | <span class="t">functions, you have a whole century's worth of math to analyze and understand them. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=488" target="_blank">00:08:08.440</a></span> | <span class="t">you'll often find probability density functions in papers, and eventually they work out to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=493" target="_blank">00:08:13.960</a></span> | <span class="t">really simple equations or formulas that end up in your code. Do you want to add anything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=503" target="_blank">00:08:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Tanish? I think that sounds all correct. Of course, I think you probably will go over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.880</a></span> | <span class="t">some examples of probability density functions, especially relevant to this one. But yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=515" target="_blank">00:08:35.700</a></span> | <span class="t">it's useful to think about the, also the sorts of functions you may have in a simplified</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=521" target="_blank">00:08:41.240</a></span> | <span class="t">case. And that's what we probably are going to talk about next, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=525" target="_blank">00:08:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, yeah, that's exactly what we talked about. So we have this QXO0, and then we introduce</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=531" target="_blank">00:08:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">another one. And like you said, this is going to turn out to have a really nice simple form.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=539" target="_blank">00:08:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">But before that, the next thing we define is QXT, given XT minus one. So we'll say what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=550" target="_blank">00:09:10.760</a></span> | <span class="t">we define this to be, but to begin with, this is another probability density function. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=558" target="_blank">00:09:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">this bar over here means it's a conditional probability density function, which you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=563" target="_blank">00:09:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">think of as you are given the thing on the right to calculate probabilities over the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=571" target="_blank">00:09:31.880</a></span> | <span class="t">thing on the left. In this case, you can think of it as something that takes images. So maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=583" target="_blank">00:09:43.880</a></span> | <span class="t">another magic API and produces other images. But we don't know what these look like yet</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=596" target="_blank">00:09:56.760</a></span> | <span class="t">because we haven't defined over here. And this, we would call XT minus one, which could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=602" target="_blank">00:10:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">be X0. And this would be XT, which in the X0 case would be X1. Something worth noting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=615" target="_blank">00:10:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">here is this notation can be a little bit confusing because we've said Q is one thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=622" target="_blank">00:10:22.760</a></span> | <span class="t">earlier and now we think Q is another thing. So this year, I'm going to need your help</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=627" target="_blank">00:10:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">on this one, Tanisha. I think people would usually, in the strictest sense, define the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=638" target="_blank">00:10:38.360</a></span> | <span class="t">first one like this, maybe, and the second one with a subscript. And this notation that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=656" target="_blank">00:10:56.600</a></span> | <span class="t">we see here on the left is just a shortcut where they wanted to save the space of writing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=666" target="_blank">00:11:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that and included that, implied it by what was in the practice. Is that true?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=673" target="_blank">00:11:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. I think they used the variables Q and then, of course, later on, we see P to describe,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=683" target="_blank">00:11:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">as we'll see, different aspects of the diffusion model and the different processes of the diffusion</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=690" target="_blank">00:11:30.600</a></span> | <span class="t">model, which we'll see. So I think that's why they use the same variables to kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=696" target="_blank">00:11:36.680</a></span> | <span class="t">demonstrate this is corresponding to this process and the other variable corresponds</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=701" target="_blank">00:11:41.160</a></span> | <span class="t">to the other process of the diffusion model. So we'll obviously go over that. So I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=706" target="_blank">00:11:46.120</a></span> | <span class="t">that's where those variables or those letters are being used in that matter. But if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=713" target="_blank">00:11:53.640</a></span> | <span class="t">do want to make it more specific, more clear, yeah, I think that that notation is fine as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=719" target="_blank">00:11:59.640</a></span> | <span class="t">well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=720" target="_blank">00:12:00.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. Yeah, that makes sense. Okay. So let's describe what this Q does to the image on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=730" target="_blank">00:12:10.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the left to produce the one on the right. So I'll start over here so we have more space.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=741" target="_blank">00:12:21.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll write it out first and then we can go into the details. Okay. So kind of like the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=764" target="_blank">00:12:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">bar, you can think of this semicolon as grouping things together. And so you have the things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=772" target="_blank">00:12:52.680</a></span> | <span class="t">on the left and the things on the right. My understanding is these two things on the right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=779" target="_blank">00:12:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">are the parameters of the model, sorry, of the probability. And the thing on the left</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=789" target="_blank">00:13:09.960</a></span> | <span class="t">is actually, Denise, could you help me understand what the thing on the left is? Do you know?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=796" target="_blank">00:13:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. Well, so this is, again, like a probability distribution. And the thing on the left is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=802" target="_blank">00:13:22.200</a></span> | <span class="t">saying this is a probability distribution for this particular variable. So that's just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=807" target="_blank">00:13:27.240</a></span> | <span class="t">representing what it is a probability distribution for. And then the stuff on the right are the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=812" target="_blank">00:13:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">parameters for this probability distribution. So that's kind of what's going on here. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=819" target="_blank">00:13:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">like, yeah, anytime you have a normal distribution and it's describing some variable, you'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=824" target="_blank">00:13:44.920</a></span> | <span class="t">have that sort of notation where it's the normal distribution of some variable. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=829" target="_blank">00:13:49.960</a></span> | <span class="t">then these are the parameters that describe that normal distribution.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=838" target="_blank">00:13:58.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. So just to clarify, the bit after the semicolon is the bit that we're kind of used</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=844" target="_blank">00:14:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">to seeing to describe a normal distribution, which is the mean and variance of the normal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=852" target="_blank">00:14:12.040</a></span> | <span class="t">distribution. So we're going to be sampling random numbers from that normal distribution</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=859" target="_blank">00:14:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">according to that mean and that variance. Is that right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=863" target="_blank">00:14:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, that's correct. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=867" target="_blank">00:14:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So we need to describe a bit more there about normal distribution. We kind of skip past</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=876" target="_blank">00:14:36.520</a></span> | <span class="t">that. So we have this fancy N and fancy letters in math for distributions usually refer to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=884" target="_blank">00:14:44.760</a></span> | <span class="t">well-known distributions. And the N here stands for normal, which is also known as the Gaussian</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=896" target="_blank">00:14:56.040</a></span> | <span class="t">distribution. And it's probably the most well-known probability distribution that you can find.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=904" target="_blank">00:15:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And when I say well-known, I mean that these things pop up everywhere. You know, you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=912" target="_blank">00:15:12.440</a></span> | <span class="t">do in all sorts of fields, measuring all sorts of things, turns out that they follow roughly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=919" target="_blank">00:15:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">something that looks like this distribution. And because they have pop up so much, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=925" target="_blank">00:15:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">know, people studied them, studied all of their properties, and we understand them really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=931" target="_blank">00:15:31.720</a></span> | <span class="t">well now. The reason that they used often in cases like this is because they turns out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=939" target="_blank">00:15:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">they have really useful properties and they're easy to work with. Some reasons are they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=946" target="_blank">00:15:46.360</a></span> | <span class="t">described by just two parameters. So the mean, called the mean and the covariance. Another</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=955" target="_blank">00:15:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">property is that they have kind of, you know, what people would call sun tails, which kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=962" target="_blank">00:16:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">of means that they only, you only need to describe their behavior in a small region</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=967" target="_blank">00:16:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">of space. You can kind of just ignore the rest. Yeah. Do you mind drawing a quick example</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=977" target="_blank">00:16:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">of a normal distribution? That's a good point. So we have, let's say our random variable</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=984" target="_blank">00:16:24.440</a></span> | <span class="t">is just one kind of dimensional. So just a single number of floats. This is sort of what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=992" target="_blank">00:16:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the normal distribution would look like. And in this case, that would be our mean. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1001" target="_blank">00:16:41.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the variance would sort of describe the width over here, which in this case, you'd use a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1011" target="_blank">00:16:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">small sigma because you're doing a single variable. In our case, we used a capital sigma,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1018" target="_blank">00:16:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">which is the symbol for multiple variables or multiple dimensions. And yeah, I also didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1028" target="_blank">00:17:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">say that this is the Greek letter mu. So capital sigma, mu, and lowercase sigma. I just wanted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1038" target="_blank">00:17:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to note that typically the lowercase sigma represents the standard deviation, which is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1045" target="_blank">00:17:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the square root of the variance. So for example, sometimes you may see in papers sigma squared,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1055" target="_blank">00:17:35.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and that's just the variance, but they will write it sometimes as sigma squared instead.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1061" target="_blank">00:17:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So it depends on the notation. So sigma is the standard deviation often, and sigma squared</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1069" target="_blank">00:17:49.800</a></span> | <span class="t">would then be the variance. Cool. Yeah, we can also show with our example what this would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1077" target="_blank">00:17:57.800</a></span> | <span class="t">look like. So we start out with a MNIST digit, put it through this magic API, and what would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1090" target="_blank">00:18:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">we get out? Okay, so something we didn't describe is what does this I mean?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1101" target="_blank">00:18:21.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Did you want me to talk about that, Wesleyan? Yes, please. Okay, sure. Because I think this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1107" target="_blank">00:18:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">is something which actually-- can I borrow your pen? It actually came up in the lesson</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1112" target="_blank">00:18:32.980</a></span> | <span class="t">we were doing kind of in an interesting way. So in that lesson--</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1118" target="_blank">00:18:38.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you want to get in the video? Ah, no, they know what I look like. Oh, well, okay, I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1123" target="_blank">00:18:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">in the video now. Yeah, in the video-- Hi, Tanish, nice to see you. Yeah, so in the lesson,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1133" target="_blank">00:18:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">we did this thing for clip, I don't know if you remember, where we had the various pictures</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1141" target="_blank">00:19:01.880</a></span> | <span class="t">down here. I'm so embarrassed, you're better at the graphics tablet than I am, and it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1146" target="_blank">00:19:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">my graphics tablet. And we had the various sentences along here. And we said, oh, it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1151" target="_blank">00:19:11.800</a></span> | <span class="t">would be kind of cool to take the dot product of their embeddings. Because if their dot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1157" target="_blank">00:19:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">products are high, that means they're similar to each other. And if we subtracted the means</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1165" target="_blank">00:19:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">from those first, then you've got the dot-- and instead of having images down here, what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1175" target="_blank">00:19:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">if we had the exact same vectors on each side? Then what you've got down here is basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1189" target="_blank">00:19:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">x minus its average, if it's a check that first, squared. And that is the variance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1200" target="_blank">00:20:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's the variance for each one of these vectors. But what's interesting, as you pointed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1208" target="_blank">00:20:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">out, is that normally, at high school, when we look at a normal distribution, it looks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1213" target="_blank">00:20:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">like this, right? But you're not just doing one normal distribution. You've got a whole</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1218" target="_blank">00:20:18.260</a></span> | <span class="t">bunch of normal distributions for all of your different pixels. They're the pixels, right,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1224" target="_blank">00:20:24.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Tanish? Normal distribution of every pixel. So there's a whole bunch of them. And so one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1229" target="_blank">00:20:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">of them might have a normal distribution that's there. And another one might have a normal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1233" target="_blank">00:20:33.080</a></span> | <span class="t">distribution that's here. And another one might have a normal distribution that's here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1238" target="_blank">00:20:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's more than that, though, because it's possible that one pixel tends to be higher</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1245" target="_blank">00:20:45.960</a></span> | <span class="t">when another pixel tends to be higher, or one pixel tends to be higher when another</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1250" target="_blank">00:20:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">pixel's lower. So it actually has kind of created this surface in n-dimensional space</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1258" target="_blank">00:20:58.200</a></span> | <span class="t">where n is the number of pixels. So if you now, like, look at, like, OK, well, what happens</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1263" target="_blank">00:21:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">if we multiply this by this, just like we did in CLIP, right? Then if this number is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1270" target="_blank">00:21:10.380</a></span> | <span class="t">high, then it's saying that when this variable is high, where this pixel's high, this pixel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1275" target="_blank">00:21:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">tends to be high, and vice versa. Or if it's low, it's saying when this pixel tends to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1279" target="_blank">00:21:19.800</a></span> | <span class="t">be high, this one tends to be low. Or, interesting to us, what happened-- oopsie, Daisy, sorry</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1285" target="_blank">00:21:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">-- what happens if this is zero? That says that if this is high, then this could be anything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1297" target="_blank">00:21:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Or if this is high, this could be anything. There's no relationship between them. So statistically,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1302" target="_blank">00:21:42.120</a></span> | <span class="t">we would say that these two pixels are independent. And so now, that basically means we could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1310" target="_blank">00:21:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">do that for all of these. We could say, oh, these are all zeros. And what that says is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1317" target="_blank">00:21:57.880</a></span> | <span class="t">that, oh, every pixel is independent of every other pixel. Now, of course, in real pictures,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1323" target="_blank">00:22:03.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that's not how real pixels work. But that's the assumption we're making. Because if we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1328" target="_blank">00:22:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">start with a very special matrix called i, which is 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0. If we take this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1342" target="_blank">00:22:22.520</a></span> | <span class="t">very special matrix-- it's very special because I can multiply it by something, say beta. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1350" target="_blank">00:22:30.360</a></span> | <span class="t">if I multiply it by a matrix, I get back the original matrix. If I multiply it by a scalar,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1355" target="_blank">00:22:35.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to get beta, beta, beta, dah, dah, dah, dah, and lots of zeros. And so if I multiply</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1362" target="_blank">00:22:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">something by this matrix, then I'm just multiplying it by beta. But what's interesting about this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1370" target="_blank">00:22:50.120</a></span> | <span class="t">is that this is what Wasim wrote. Wasim wrote i times beta, i times beta t. So what he's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1378" target="_blank">00:22:58.440</a></span> | <span class="t">saying is, oh, we've now got a covariance matrix where for each individual pixel, it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1387" target="_blank">00:23:07.400</a></span> | <span class="t">like pixel number 1, beta 1, pixel number 2, beta 2. This is the variances of each one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1394" target="_blank">00:23:14.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And the covariances, the relationship between the pixels is 0. They're expected to be independent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1402" target="_blank">00:23:22.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's where we're going from statistics you do in high school to statistics you do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1408" target="_blank">00:23:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">at university. It's like suddenly covariance is now a matrices, not individual numbers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1414" target="_blank">00:23:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Does that sound about right to you, Tanishk?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1416" target="_blank">00:23:36.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, that's a great explanation of it, yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1421" target="_blank">00:23:41.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Awesome. Cool. So now let's try to describe what this would do to MNIST digits. So let's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1432" target="_blank">00:23:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">put back our mean equation and our covariance. So mean and our covariance. And let's look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1451" target="_blank">00:24:11.400</a></span> | <span class="t">at how this behaves at the edges. So it's really hard to understand this. I don't think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1459" target="_blank">00:24:19.220</a></span> | <span class="t">anybody can just look at this and know what it means. What we typically do is we try to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1465" target="_blank">00:24:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">describe it at the edges. And so we'll start with what happens if that's 0. And we'll work</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1473" target="_blank">00:24:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">with x0 as well instead of xt minus 1, which would mean an MNIST digit. So if beta is 0</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1482" target="_blank">00:24:42.520</a></span> | <span class="t">then we get our x0, you know, square root 1 minus 0, which is 1 and square root of 1</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1491" target="_blank">00:24:51.320</a></span> | <span class="t">is 1. So that kind of falls away. So we just have a mean of our previous image. And this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1499" target="_blank">00:24:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">is just variance of 0. So we have a normal distribution with a mean of our previous image</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1506" target="_blank">00:25:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">of variance of 0, which means we have the same image.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1518" target="_blank">00:25:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, just to clarify, when you have variance of 0, that means that there's really no noise</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1526" target="_blank">00:25:26.200</a></span> | <span class="t">or anything. It's just at that mean and, you know, your distribution is just saying that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1531" target="_blank">00:25:31.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the only point that you can get from it. So yeah, that just becomes the same image because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1535" target="_blank">00:25:35.800</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah, there's no noise or variance because the variance is 0.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1541" target="_blank">00:25:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, exactly. And then when our beta is 1, we still have this and then we have, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1551" target="_blank">00:25:51.880</a></span> | <span class="t">square root 1 minus 1 and that becomes 0. So this whole thing becomes 0. And this thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1562" target="_blank">00:26:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">becomes i times beta t, which is, you know, i. And if it's just i, then as Jeremy described,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1571" target="_blank">00:26:11.480</a></span> | <span class="t">it would, you know, imply a variance of 1. And so our image through this function would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1585" target="_blank">00:26:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">just be pure noise. So let, you know, mean of 0, standard deviation of 1, and it would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1593" target="_blank">00:26:33.880</a></span> | <span class="t">just be a bunch of noise and kind of somewhere in between that, we have to say over here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1604" target="_blank">00:26:44.940</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, what would it produce? It would be some mixture. So, you know, like maybe a light,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1613" target="_blank">00:26:53.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the lighter pixels of 8 and some noise, maybe a bit darker. And we can kind of draw this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1626" target="_blank">00:27:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and you would have seen this in the previous lecture. You can draw the sequence of things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1638" target="_blank">00:27:18.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that become progressively more noisy in very small steps, all the way until it becomes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1646" target="_blank">00:27:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">pure noise. This is what we call the forward diffusion process. And we can now describe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1661" target="_blank">00:27:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">some of these things. So this would be a sample from our data distribution qx0. This would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1672" target="_blank">00:27:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">be the function for the conditional probability density function that takes, so of x1 given</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1685" target="_blank">00:28:05.080</a></span> | <span class="t">x0 and so on. And the way that the terminology that we would use or that mathematicians used</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1700" target="_blank">00:28:20.440</a></span> | <span class="t">to describe this is they would call it a Markov process with Gaussian transitions. And this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1720" target="_blank">00:28:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">can sound quite scary, but we've just described exactly what this is. So when we say process,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1727" target="_blank">00:28:47.520</a></span> | <span class="t">it usually means, you know, something where there's a sequence involved. When we say Markov,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1735" target="_blank">00:28:55.860</a></span> | <span class="t">it means that the thing at time t depends only on the thing at t minus 1. The transition</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1746" target="_blank">00:29:06.920</a></span> | <span class="t">is this function. How do you actually go from t minus 1 to t? And Gaussian is the fact that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1756" target="_blank">00:29:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that transition is the normal distribution. Does that sound right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1762" target="_blank">00:29:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes. Just to also clarify a couple of things, when we say that, you know, we're sampling</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1768" target="_blank">00:29:28.760</a></span> | <span class="t">from the data distribution, what that is referring to is trying to find some random sample or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1778" target="_blank">00:29:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">some random data point that maximizes that likelihood or that has a high likelihood.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1785" target="_blank">00:29:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So when we say that, you know, we're looking at that API, that magic API we were talking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1790" target="_blank">00:29:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">about, and we're trying to get some, you know, some data points that have a high value from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1796" target="_blank">00:29:56.920</a></span> | <span class="t">that API. And, you know, for some distributions, it's very simple and we know how it works</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1803" target="_blank">00:30:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">like a Gaussian distribution. If we know the parameters of that Gaussian distribution,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1808" target="_blank">00:30:08.100</a></span> | <span class="t">it's very easy to be able to do that sampling. And then of course, in other cases, it's not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1813" target="_blank">00:30:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">very easy, it's not, it's quite difficult to do that sampling. So then we have to figure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1818" target="_blank">00:30:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">alternative ways of doing that sampling. But that's why in this case, with the forward</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1822" target="_blank">00:30:22.520</a></span> | <span class="t">distribution, we just have these simple Gaussian transitions. And we already know the parameters</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1828" target="_blank">00:30:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">of those Gaussian transitions, so we can easily do that sampling. And going back also to that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1836" target="_blank">00:30:36.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's worthwhile to also kind of show and think about maybe how this is again done</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1841" target="_blank">00:30:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">practically. Because one of the nice properties of Gaussian distributions as a whole is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1848" target="_blank">00:30:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">you can, you know, simply take some normal noise at with a mean of zero and variance</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1855" target="_blank">00:30:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">of one. So that's, I think they usually typically call that a unit, unit distribution is just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1863" target="_blank">00:31:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">like, yeah, normal of zero, one. And then if you want to get to some other point with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1868" target="_blank">00:31:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">a mean of whatever value you specify and a variance of whatever value you specify, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1874" target="_blank">00:31:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">can simply take that normal distribution, scale it by the, you multiply it by the variance,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1884" target="_blank">00:31:24.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and then you add your, your mean. So then there's a simple equation that you can take</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1889" target="_blank">00:31:29.560</a></span> | <span class="t">to get the, to get any particular mean and variance. So that's how you would get the samples</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1901" target="_blank">00:31:41.280</a></span> | <span class="t">for these other distributions that we have defined throughout the forward distribution.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1907" target="_blank">00:31:47.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, for example, when you're coding this up, of course, a lot of these softwares,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1914" target="_blank">00:31:54.200</a></span> | <span class="t">they will have a way of getting a sample from this normal distribution of zero, one. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1922" target="_blank">00:32:02.360</a></span> | <span class="t">then you just use that equation then to get it at the desired mean and variance. So that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1927" target="_blank">00:32:07.400</a></span> | <span class="t">how it kind of happens under the hood when you're, when you're kind of describe this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1931" target="_blank">00:32:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">with code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1933" target="_blank">00:32:13.400</a></span> | <span class="t">That's really helpful. Yeah. And this idea of, we can't really sample from this thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1943" target="_blank">00:32:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">That's exactly, you know, the problem that generative kind of modeling is trying to solve.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1948" target="_blank">00:32:28.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Like how do you represent this in such a way that you can easily sample from it? And so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1955" target="_blank">00:32:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">it turns out that if you have one of these processes, you know, where you have many,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1961" target="_blank">00:32:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">many steps, so let's say a thousand steps, a thousand of these steps going to the right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1968" target="_blank">00:32:48.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and they're all very small steps that eventually go to noise, somebody, you know, maybe in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1977" target="_blank">00:32:57.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the 1950s, I think, discovered that you can represent the process of going backwards in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1989" target="_blank">00:33:09.720</a></span> | <span class="t">exactly the same functional form with just different parameters. So what that means is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=1995" target="_blank">00:33:15.600</a></span> | <span class="t">if we say P is the thing that goes backwards. So, you know, the previous one, given the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2003" target="_blank">00:33:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">current one, the P has the same functional form. So it's also, the transitions are also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2016" target="_blank">00:33:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">normal, but the mean is, you know, some unknown. So we'll use a square and the variance is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2023" target="_blank">00:33:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">some unknown. So we use a triangle. Is that correct?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2031" target="_blank">00:33:51.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, that's correct. And just going back to our previous point about P versus Q, here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2036" target="_blank">00:33:56.520</a></span> | <span class="t">we can see that the Q was describing the sort of forward process going, you know, yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2042" target="_blank">00:34:02.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the sort of steps that we're doing. And then the P is describing what we're going in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2047" target="_blank">00:34:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">reverse way. So that's why, you know, these papers are using, you know, Q for one process</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2055" target="_blank">00:34:15.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and then P for another. That's what they're kind of indicating, at least in the diffusion</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2059" target="_blank">00:34:19.360</a></span> | <span class="t">model literature.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2062" target="_blank">00:34:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And P is kind of like X, you know, it's the one we want to figure out. So like Q is kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2068" target="_blank">00:34:28.440</a></span> | <span class="t">of like Y and P is kind of like X. That's how I like to think of that. And so, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2074" target="_blank">00:34:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">we have this functional form and the next question is how can we use this or, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2082" target="_blank">00:34:42.040</a></span> | <span class="t">we just don't know what these parameters are. How can we figure out what those are? And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2088" target="_blank">00:34:48.280</a></span> | <span class="t">this goes back, you know, to early kind of statistics literature where you can fit this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2096" target="_blank">00:34:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">model using by maximizing what's called the likelihood function. So we can try different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2105" target="_blank">00:35:05.080</a></span> | <span class="t">parameters until we have one that maximizes the likelihood.

So you can't actually calculate this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2132" target="_blank">00:35:32.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I think you can think of it because, you know, we're having these thousands of steps that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2138" target="_blank">00:35:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">we're trying to go in this reverse process.

So it's kind of hard</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2147" target="_blank">00:35:47.040</a></span> | <span class="t">to evaluate it over all these thousands of steps and all the possible values for all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2151" target="_blank">00:35:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">these different steps. So I think that's kind of where the challenges arise and that's what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2156" target="_blank">00:35:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">it makes it difficult because you have to evaluate it over these multiple steps and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2162" target="_blank">00:36:02.680</a></span> | <span class="t">try to find these functions for all these different steps. So that's kind of where the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2167" target="_blank">00:36:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">challenge is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2173" target="_blank">00:36:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you might see people talk not about the likelihood function, but about the log-likelihood.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2183" target="_blank">00:36:23.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And correct me if I'm wrong here, Tanish, but I think the log here is a bit of a computational</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2190" target="_blank">00:36:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">trick almost. So I think it has a few properties. The first is that it's always increasing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2198" target="_blank">00:36:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, people would call this monotonic.

It also takes products to sums. And that's helpful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2225" target="_blank">00:37:05.460</a></span> | <span class="t">because we have joint distributions, you know, which turn out to be products. So it turns</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2230" target="_blank">00:37:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">out we have a lot of products here and they become sums, which is easy to work with. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2234" target="_blank">00:37:14.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the last thing is that, you know, this normal distribution has exponential functions and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2245" target="_blank">00:37:25.240</a></span> | <span class="t">those disappear with the log. So this is the much friendlier thing to optimize.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2257" target="_blank">00:37:37.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Cool. And then there's one more step. You know, we still can't optimize the log-likelihood</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2264" target="_blank">00:37:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">of the thing that this eventually describes. But again, and this is kind of the beauty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2271" target="_blank">00:37:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">of math is that somebody figured out a long time ago that there's a way to optimize some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2277" target="_blank">00:37:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">other quantity called the ALBO for short, which stands for Evidence Lower Bound.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2290" target="_blank">00:38:10.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And the evidence is just another name for the likelihood. And the lower bound means</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2310" target="_blank">00:38:30.120</a></span> | <span class="t">it's, you know, the lower bound of the evidence. And if you optimize that, it's almost as good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2316" target="_blank">00:38:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">as optimizing the thing that we really want to. But this one we can calculate very, very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2324" target="_blank">00:38:44.920</a></span> | <span class="t">easily. And so you can use this as a loss function to train two neural networks that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2344" target="_blank">00:39:04.640</a></span> | <span class="t">predict our square from earlier, which was our mean, and our triangle, which is our variance</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2353" target="_blank">00:39:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">of this reverse process. And once you have that, you go all the way back here. So then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2360" target="_blank">00:39:20.840</a></span> | <span class="t">you have these values.

One thing that's important to clarify here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2387" target="_blank">00:39:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">is that you can recover the whole distribution, but you can't necessarily take a single image,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2397" target="_blank">00:39:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">get it to pure noise and then convert it back.

So that's what we're trying to do. We're trying to match</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2471" target="_blank">00:41:11.560</a></span> | <span class="t">that sort of those distributions and there's a specific type of function and it's able</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2478" target="_blank">00:41:18.440</a></span> | <span class="t">to do that. It's called a KL divergence. That's the sort of function that can compare probability</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2484" target="_blank">00:41:24.920</a></span> | <span class="t">distributions. And again, because we're dealing with Gaussians, you can calculate that analytically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2491" target="_blank">00:41:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and a lot of the math becomes very simple. So that's again, with the whole Gaussians,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2500" target="_blank">00:41:40.040</a></span> | <span class="t">we know them quite well and the math is very simple. So that allows us to do this sort</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2504" target="_blank">00:41:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">of comparison between these distributions very easily and optimize that. And so we want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2510" target="_blank">00:41:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to kind of minimize the difference between the distributions we see in the forward process</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2515" target="_blank">00:41:55.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and the distributions we're trying to determine for the reverse process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2521" target="_blank">00:42:01.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Perfect. Then there's one more thing, I think, one more kind of major step to get closer to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2532" target="_blank">00:42:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">the form that you would have seen in Jeremy's lesson. So there was a 2020 paper. The initials</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2542" target="_blank">00:42:22.200</a></span> | <span class="t">of that model is DDPM. Tanish, do you know what this stands for?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2548" target="_blank">00:42:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, that's for denoising, diffusion, probabilistic model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2553" target="_blank">00:42:33.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, cool. And what they did was they said, let's assume that this variance is just a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2566" target="_blank">00:42:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">constant so we don't learn it. And we assume also that the step size from earlier, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2576" target="_blank">00:42:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">know, the variance of the noise that we add at each step is also a constant. We don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2582" target="_blank">00:43:02.200</a></span> | <span class="t">learn that. So we're just predicting the mean and these are set to some really convenient</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2588" target="_blank">00:43:08.200</a></span> | <span class="t">values. Then the last turns out to be that you predict the noise. So you can restructure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2604" target="_blank">00:43:24.480</a></span> | <span class="t">this whole thing as you need to train a network that takes in images. So here's your network</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2617" target="_blank">00:43:37.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and it tells you what of this image is noise. Thanks to these simplifying assumptions. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2630" target="_blank">00:43:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">even though they're assumptions, turns out you can train much more, you know, models</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2637" target="_blank">00:43:57.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that produce much better images. Now, I think this relates to something from the, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2646" target="_blank">00:44:06.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the lesson that Jeremy gave. Tanish, do you remember that there was something about the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2652" target="_blank">00:44:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">gradient or something like that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2654" target="_blank">00:44:14.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, yes. So this idea of, you know, adding noise and learning to remove noise, the idea</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2665" target="_blank">00:44:25.240</a></span> | <span class="t">is that kind of by, you know, again, you have this sort of this image that you have noise,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2675" target="_blank">00:44:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">right? And by, sorry, let me think about the best way to say this. Oh, yeah, sorry. Okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2686" target="_blank">00:44:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">let me just turn it over. So I'll just start. Yeah, so like Jeremy will say in the lesson,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2695" target="_blank">00:44:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">what we want to do is we want to figure out the gradient of this likelihood function.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2703" target="_blank">00:45:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is just kind of a different way about thinking about this. If we had some information</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2707" target="_blank">00:45:07.960</a></span> | <span class="t">about this gradient, then we could, for example, you know, use that information to produce</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2716" target="_blank">00:45:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">like we talked about, kind of this optimization, kind of produce images with high likelihood.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2722" target="_blank">00:45:22.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So the idea is that we can add noise to the images that we have. So those are samples</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2730" target="_blank">00:45:30.120</a></span> | <span class="t">that we have. And that kind of takes us away from, you know, the regular images that we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2736" target="_blank">00:45:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">know that we have. And, you know, that kind of decreases the likelihood, right? So we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2740" target="_blank">00:45:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">have those images and we're adding noise that decreases the likelihood. And we want to kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2745" target="_blank">00:45:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">of learn how to get back to high likelihood images and kind of use that to provide some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2751" target="_blank">00:45:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of estimate of our gradient. So this sort of denoising process actually allows us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2757" target="_blank">00:45:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">to do that. So there are actually theorems also, I think, from the 1950s that demonstrate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2764" target="_blank">00:46:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that especially in the case of this sort of Gaussian noise that we're working with, this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2769" target="_blank">00:46:09.080</a></span> | <span class="t">denoising process is equivalent to learning what is known as the score function. And the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2776" target="_blank">00:46:16.440</a></span> | <span class="t">score function is the gradient of the log of the likelihood. So again, they have this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2784" target="_blank">00:46:24.040</a></span> | <span class="t">log here, which, again, makes the math nicer and easier to work with. But the general idea</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2789" target="_blank">00:46:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">is the same because as we talked about, log is a monotonic function. So again, the general</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2795" target="_blank">00:46:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">ideas are the same, but the score function specifically refers to the gradient of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2801" target="_blank">00:46:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">log likelihood. So this sort of denoising process allows us to learn the score function. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2811" target="_blank">00:46:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">that's when we're doing this noise, predicting that we had this whole probabilistic framework</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2816" target="_blank">00:46:56.920</a></span> | <span class="t">using that sort of likelihood framework. And it came back down to just predicting the noise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2822" target="_blank">00:47:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's what the DPM paper showed in 2020. But it turns out that is equivalent to calculating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2830" target="_blank">00:47:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">out this sort of score function and using that information to be able to sample from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2836" target="_blank">00:47:16.760</a></span> | <span class="t">our distribution. So that's kind of how these two approaches connect. So there's a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2842" target="_blank">00:47:22.360</a></span> | <span class="t">literature talking about maybe the sort of probabilistic likelihood perspectives of diffusion</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2847" target="_blank">00:47:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">models. And there's also a lot of literature talking about this score-based perspective.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2853" target="_blank">00:47:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">But this hopefully allows you to think about the similarities and how these two approaches</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2859" target="_blank">00:47:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">connect with each other. Yeah, awesome. Yeah. And that's kind of the beauty, I think, of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2866" target="_blank">00:47:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the math side of things here is that you find all of these relationships between different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2872" target="_blank">00:47:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">fields and also like between different centuries, basically. And that allows you to do really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2878" target="_blank">00:47:58.840</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of powerful and unexpected things. Okay, so you can just do a quick recap of where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2889" target="_blank">00:48:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">we got to. So we started out with our data distribution, which we want to model. We said</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2896" target="_blank">00:48:16.920</a></span> | <span class="t">we'll define this forward diffusion process, which is a way of kind of adding noise to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2903" target="_blank">00:48:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">this model. And because we add it in this specific way, thanks to some discovery in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2912" target="_blank">00:48:32.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the 1950s, the reverse process has the same form. And then we already know how to train</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2925" target="_blank">00:48:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">a neural network for this using the elbow. And then a couple of years later came the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2935" target="_blank">00:48:55.400</a></span> | <span class="t">discovery, simplifying assumptions that in the end, all we do is predict the noise. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2942" target="_blank">00:49:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I just remembered we take actually the MSE of this noise prediction, the mean squared</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2948" target="_blank">00:49:08.840</a></span> | <span class="t">error, which is a nice, very simple framing of the model. And Antoni spoke about another</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2955" target="_blank">00:49:15.560</a></span> | <span class="t">way to derive all of this, which is the score function approach, the gradient of the log-like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=2960" target="_blank">00:49:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">period.

He's a, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=3030" target="_blank">00:50:30.600</a></span> | <span class="t">know, he's a great teacher and he was, I think he was the first person to do a full course</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=3036" target="_blank">00:50:36.440</a></span> | <span class="t">on unstable diffusion. Yeah, Jono's video is kind of a deep dive into some of the code</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=3041" target="_blank">00:50:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">a little bit more and into some of the concepts a little bit more. So I feel like between these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=3045" target="_blank">00:50:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">three videos, it's a good overview. You know, I think, I mean, just to clarify, you don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=3054" target="_blank">00:50:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">need to understand all the math that was described in this video. That's not to say you want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=3059" target="_blank">00:50:59.160</a></span> | <span class="t">me to understand math. We'll be covering lots of math in these lessons. But we'll be covering</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=3066" target="_blank">00:51:06.520</a></span> | <span class="t">just the math you need to understand and build on the code. And we'll be covering it over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=3073" target="_blank">00:51:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">many, many more hours than this rather rapid overview.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYpjmM7O-30&t=3078" target="_blank">00:51:18.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Perfect.
