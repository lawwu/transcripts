I know much, I feel much, and I'm responsible to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOz1diQl4B8&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.840</a></span> | <span class="t">say much, and therefore the likelihood that I will not live up to this much or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOz1diQl4B8&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.880</a></span> | <span class="t">teach faithfully this much is very great, and therefore my judgment will be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOz1diQl4B8&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">greater.
