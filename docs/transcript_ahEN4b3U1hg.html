Why aren't more foreign governments using it to spread propaganda or scam grandmothers or something? Maybe they haven't really gotten to do it a lot, but it also wouldn't surprise me if some of it was going on right now.</p><p>Certainly I imagine they'd be taking some of the open source models and try and use them for that purpose. Like I sure I would expect this would be something that'd be interested in the future. It's like technically possible. They just haven't thought about it enough. Or haven't done it at scale using their technology, or maybe it's happening, but you just don't know it.</p><p>Would you be able to track it if it was happening? I think large scale tracking is possible. Yes, it requires all special operations.</p></div></div></body></html>
