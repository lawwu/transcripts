But first, Duncan, what's going on? Question</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDGnZ2AErBg&t=54" target="_blank">00:00:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">number one. Hey, Ben. Good morning, everyone. So first up today, we have the following.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDGnZ2AErBg&t=64" target="_blank">00:01:04.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So first up, I have a question about saving versus investing. I'm a 26-year-old medical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDGnZ2AErBg&t=69" target="_blank">00:01:09.260</a></span> | <span class="t">student and my wife and I are looking to buy a house in the next year or two. She's a teacher</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDGnZ2AErBg&t=73" target="_blank">00:01:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and makes around $50,000 pre-tax. I will be a resident next year and will make around</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDGnZ2AErBg&t=78" target="_blank">00:01:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">$55,000 pre-tax. We currently have about $5,000 in a Roth and $11,000 in a Marcus account.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDGnZ2AErBg&t=85" target="_blank">00:01:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">My wife has $7,000 in her 403(b) and we have no kids. Should I risk more of my savings</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDGnZ2AErBg&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.220</a></span> | <span class="t">in Marcus and invest it given how low rates are? Maybe a higher dividend ETF short-term?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDGnZ2AErBg&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so this is a question that we get in some form or another dozens of times every</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDGnZ2AErBg&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.960</a></span> | <span class="t">month. It's partially because of the low-rate environment we're in, right? If you go to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDGnZ2AErBg&t=108" target="_blank">00:01:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">a savings account, so I also have an account at Marcus. They are currently paying 0.5%,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDGnZ2AErBg&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.640</a></span> | <span class="t">half a percent in interest. So it's not like you can just get in your money market or savings</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDGnZ2AErBg&t=117" target="_blank">00:01:57.220</a></span> | <span class="t">account 4% or 5% like you could in the past. The way that I look at this is, what's your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDGnZ2AErBg&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.760</a></span> | <span class="t">upside and what's your downside? Because we know risk and reward are attached to the hip.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDGnZ2AErBg&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's say you go out and take a little more risk and you can earn 5% extra per year</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDGnZ2AErBg&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.440</a></span> | <span class="t">as you're saving for down payment over the next year, two, three years. On $10,000, that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDGnZ2AErBg&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.080</a></span> | <span class="t">an extra $500 a year. So that's your upside if you can increase by 5%. Obviously, if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDGnZ2AErBg&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">can increase by more than that, it's more. So if you're saving for a $20,000 down payment,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDGnZ2AErBg&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.920</a></span> | <span class="t">we're talking $1,000 a year that you could get extra by investing that money. So that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDGnZ2AErBg&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the upside. What's the downside? All right, Duncan, put up the S&P 500 table here that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDGnZ2AErBg&t=155" target="_blank">00:02:35.160</a></span> | <span class="t">shows the amount of times it's positive and negative. So what I did here, I took the S&P</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDGnZ2AErBg&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">500. So let's say you want to take more risk. Put this money in stocks instead of cash.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDGnZ2AErBg&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.780</a></span> | <span class="t">I looked over one, three, and five-year time horizons, rolling returns going back to 1926.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDGnZ2AErBg&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So on one-year basis, roughly three-quarters of the time, you're going to see positive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDGnZ2AErBg&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">returns historically. Three years, it's almost 85%. Over five years, you're getting closer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDGnZ2AErBg&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to 90% of the time. So the odds are in your favor that if you hold even for five years</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDGnZ2AErBg&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">if you're saving for a down payment, it's pretty good odds that you're going to see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDGnZ2AErBg&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.520</a></span> | <span class="t">a positive return. Unfortunately, the downside here is, I looked at the worst returns in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDGnZ2AErBg&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">these periods, so the times you did have negative returns. The worst one-year return in history</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDGnZ2AErBg&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">for the S&P 500, -68%. Over three years, you could have lost 81%. Over five years, 61%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDGnZ2AErBg&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, to be fair, those returns are from the Great Depression. It's not exactly the best</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDGnZ2AErBg&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.640</a></span> | <span class="t">analogy here. That's the worst, worst, worst-case scenario. So let's say if you look more in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDGnZ2AErBg&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.080</a></span> | <span class="t">modern times. This is since 1960, what I'll call the modern stock market. The worst one-year</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDGnZ2AErBg&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.200</a></span> | <span class="t">return was -43%. Over three years, the worst return was -41%. Over five years, still, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDGnZ2AErBg&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">lost close to 30% in the worst return. So, stocks are still risky. If you want to spend</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDGnZ2AErBg&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">that money when you need it and the stock market is crashing, you're kind of out of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDGnZ2AErBg&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.320</a></span> | <span class="t">luck. So let's say, instead of the S&P 500, we looked at a 50/50 portfolio. So now I took</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDGnZ2AErBg&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the returns of the S&P 500, put them against the five-year Treasury, which is just an intermediate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDGnZ2AErBg&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">term government bond, and looked at a 50/50 portfolio. Now things look a little better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDGnZ2AErBg&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So you split the difference. You do some in a safe bond. You do some in the stock market.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDGnZ2AErBg&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Over one year, you're positive 82% of the time. Over three years, 93% of the time. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDGnZ2AErBg&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.600</a></span> | <span class="t">over five years, you're only down roughly 4% of the time. So your odds increase more,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDGnZ2AErBg&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of splitting the difference here. Again, you can have bad returns, though, in those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDGnZ2AErBg&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.080</a></span> | <span class="t">negative times. The worst one-year return was 38%. The worst three-year return was a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDGnZ2AErBg&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">loss of almost 50%. And over five years, you still could have seen a 25% loss in a 50/50</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDGnZ2AErBg&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">portfolio. Again, that's all Great Depression stuff, so let's look at the more modern times.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDGnZ2AErBg&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Since 1960, the worst one-year return for a 50/50 portfolio was close to 20%. Over three</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDGnZ2AErBg&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">years, 8%. And surprisingly, over five years, you've never seen a down year for a 50/50</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDGnZ2AErBg&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.360</a></span> | <span class="t">portfolio over a five-year period since 1960.
