Just a few things happened that I thought were interesting. One, I've started using the Flighty app almost exclusively as the way I manage all of my travel plans with flights. The coolest thing happened, because Flighty is monitoring all the inbound aircraft and everything, I got an alert one hour before departure that they estimated that my departure would be pushed back by 15 or 20 minutes.</p><p>And it took a full 40 minutes before the airline actually pushed back the departure to the exact time that Flighty was estimating they would. Now, it's no surprise that with all the data they have, they've probably learned when inbound aircrafts on this airline are delayed by this much at this airport, it results in a delayed departure time of this.</p></div></div></body></html>
