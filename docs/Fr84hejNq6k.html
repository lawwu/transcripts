"I feel like you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr84hejNq6k&t=77" target="_blank">00:01:17.560</a></span> | <span class="t">guys get very similar questions in the realm of what should I do with my money next.

I pulled this one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr84hejNq6k&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">out myself last week.

The textbook personal finance answer would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr84hejNq6k&t=100" target="_blank">00:01:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">go something like this. First, you get the match from your 401(k). If you have one from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr84hejNq6k&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.080</a></span> | <span class="t">your employer, that's 100% ROI. You can't really turn that down. Then you'd pay down</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr84hejNq6k&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.720</a></span> | <span class="t">high interest rate credit card debts.

After that, then you move back to the 401(k), max that out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr84hejNq6k&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I think for 2023, it's $22,500.

Then finally, after all that's taken care of, then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr84hejNq6k&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you can open a taxable brokerage account.

Once you feel the emotions of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr84hejNq6k&t=424" target="_blank">00:07:04.540</a></span> | <span class="t">making money or losing money, you can't describe that and recreate that on a spreadsheet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr84hejNq6k&t=430" target="_blank">00:07:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">The other thing is, one of the hypotheticals people will say is, "Pretend your portfolio</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr84hejNq6k&t=434" target="_blank">00:07:14.240</a></span> | <span class="t">was starting from scratch today.

"I know my emotions are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr84hejNq6k&t=505" target="_blank">00:08:25.560</a></span> | <span class="t">getting in the way here.

So there really is no good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr84hejNq6k&t=535" target="_blank">00:08:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">answer to that question.

As a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr84hejNq6k&t=541" target="_blank">00:09:01.160</a></span> | <span class="t">matter of fact, probably the best answer comes from Fisher Black, Black-Scholes. And he wasn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr84hejNq6k&t=548" target="_blank">00:09:08.260</a></span> | <span class="t">even an economist or psychologist.
