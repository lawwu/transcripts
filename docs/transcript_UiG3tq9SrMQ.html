Hi, my name is Pastor Justin Beer. I'm with Masters Bible Church in Vancouver, Washington. We are a Grace Advanced Church plant. We've been up there about seven years now, and we are really enjoying the conference. We actually have a bunch of our guys that come here regularly and make a good men's retreat out of it in a way so that everyone is edified and built up as we seek to build up men in the local body.</p><p>Awesome. And how many times have you been at Shepard's Conference? Yeah, this will be my fifth time. Oh, wow. And you've been reading the LSB. What do you think? Yeah, we love the LSB at Masters Bible Church. That's what we use. That's what we recommend to our congregants. And it's just been such a blessing to have that more literal translation, word-for-word, and being able to dive into the text and let the reader decide for themselves.</p><p>All right. Hey, thank you for joining us today. Appreciate it.</p></div></div></body></html>
