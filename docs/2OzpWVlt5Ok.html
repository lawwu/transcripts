| <span class="t">That was about a 20% reduction in capacity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=799" target="_blank">00:13:19.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But what happened during COVID was there was also a 20% increase in demand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=804" target="_blank">00:13:24.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So, this time, there's not an increase in demand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=806" target="_blank">00:13:26.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I don't think it's as impactful as what we saw to shipping prices during COVID where you had like a 10x run-up in price.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=813" target="_blank">00:13:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But you're already seeing prices are coming out now for January freight, for ocean freight, Asia to Europe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=818" target="_blank">00:13:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You're seeing about a 3x increase in the price of ocean freight versus where we were a month or two ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=824" target="_blank">00:13:44.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Which was very, very cheap a month or two ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=826" target="_blank">00:13:46.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I wouldn't read too much into this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=828" target="_blank">00:13:48.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And frankly, the Suez Canal is too valuable, in my opinion, too valuable to civilization, to the modern world, to believe that a group of rebels, no matter how well-funded they may be, is going to be able to disrupt that for any long period of time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=845" target="_blank">00:14:05.200</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:14:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, okay, two points on that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=851" target="_blank">00:14:11.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we call them a rebel group.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=854" target="_blank">00:14:14.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And I guess they are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=855" target="_blank">00:14:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a Shia group in Yemen that rose up in 2014 and deposed the monarch there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=861" target="_blank">00:14:21.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And they basically control large swaths of the country.</span></div><div

recognized.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=866" target="_blank">00:14:26.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So, that's why they're called rebels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=867" target="_blank">00:14:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But make no mistake, they basically control the vast majority of Yemen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=871" target="_blank">00:14:31.300</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a Shia group.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=872" target="_blank">00:14:32.200</a></span> | <span

<span class="t">But I'm not sure they're controlled by Iran.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=877" target="_blank">00:14:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">People call them proxies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=878" target="_blank">00:14:38.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's true to some degree.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=879" target="_blank">00:14:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But they also have agency.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=881" target="_blank">00:14:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Like you said, Jaykal, they are doing this, they say, in solidarity with the Palestinians.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=888" target="_blank">00:14:48.500</a></span> | <span class="t">When the invasion of Gaza first began, they were firing rockets at Israel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=893" target="_blank">00:14:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But they had to go all the way over Saudi Arabia.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=895" target="_blank">00:14:55.500</a></span> | <span class="t">They didn't make it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=896" target="_blank">00:14:56.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So, now, they've started firing on ships that are going through the strait.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=900" target="_blank">00:15:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">They started mining the strait.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=902" target="_blank">00:15:02.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, like Ryan's saying, this has basically put a damper on commerce, unless you're a country that the Houthis like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=910" target="_blank">00:15:10.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Apparently, Russia's been able to move its ships through still.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=914" target="_blank">00:15:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">They claim they're only targeting ships that are transacting with Israel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=918" target="_blank">00:15:18.300</a></span> | <span class="t">But that's not true.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=919" target="_blank">00:15:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, a lot of ships have been targeted that don't have a relationship with Israel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=923" target="_blank">00:15:23.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So, let's just say, broadly speaking, for Western ships, they can't get through.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=927" target="_blank">00:15:27.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, what the U.S. has done in response to Ryan's point is that we've announced this Operation Prosperity Guardian, which is to restore the flow of trade through, you know, the Red Sea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=939" target="_blank">00:15:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But the question is what that's going to involve.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=940" target="_blank">00:15:40.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think we are bracing now for the U.S. to start taking military action against the Houthis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=948" target="_blank">00:15:48.600</a></span> | <span class="t">The problem is, I think, Ryan, when you're saying this is going to be resolved maybe quickly, is that the U.S. was already backing the Saudis in a war against the Houthis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=959" target="_blank">00:15:59.800</a></span> | <span class="t">That started in 2015.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=961" target="_blank">00:16:01.300</a></span> | <span class="t">It only got sort of resolved with a ceasefire that's still pretty fragile last year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=966" target="_blank">00:16:06.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, the Houthis have already survived almost a decade of Western-sponsored attacks on them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=972" target="_blank">00:16:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not clear what we have to do to basically stop them from taking these actions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=977" target="_blank">00:16:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think if the U.S. starts a war, basically, against the Houthis in Yemen, we're talking about an expansion of this conflict in the Middle East from, you know, beyond what's happening in Gaza to now another front that directly involves the U.S.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=992" target="_blank">00:16:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Moreover, this is, I think, very underreported, but there have been almost 80 attacks

target="_blank">00:18:17.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, this is the fastest route for many parts of Asia to the east coast of the United States.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1104" target="_blank">00:18:24.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And especially with the Panama Canal is also congested at the same moment right now because of, they say it's because of a drought.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1110" target="_blank">00:18:30.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But actually, they built a bigger canal and it's just draining the lake faster.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1114" target="_blank">00:18:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's my hypothesis, but I'd like to look into it a little further.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1118" target="_blank">00:18:38.100</a></span> | <span class="t">But the Panama Canal is only going at about two-thirds capacity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1122" target="_blank">00:18:42.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're going Asia to the east coast, those are your options.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1125" target="_blank">00:18:45.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But to go around the southern tip of Africa, around the Cape of Good Hope to get to the east coast, it's like an 8% increase in transit time versus 20 to Europe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1135" target="_blank">00:18:55.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's alternatives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1136" target="_blank">00:18:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So definitely impacts Europe much more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1138" target="_blank">00:18:58.700</a></span> | <span class="t">It impacts China.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1139" target="_blank">00:18:59.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Like the reason I think that there's so many people lined up here, like this is not good for China.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1147" target="_blank">00:19:07.900</a></span> | <span class="t">China wants to be able to ship stuff quickly to Europe and get it to market.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1151" target="_blank">00:19:11.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And so to the extent that they have any impact, I think they're going to be clearly on the same side as the United States here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1155" target="_blank">00:19:15.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Europe obviously has a thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1157" target="_blank">00:19:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And the other thing that I haven't heard anyone talk about is like, if you look at that map, they're blockading not just the Suez, but they're blockading Saudi Arabia.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1163"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1167" target="_blank">00:19:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I don't think they're going to tolerate being cut off from the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1170" target="_blank">00:19:30.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Yemen taking on Saudi seems like an unwise idea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1174" target="_blank">00:19:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, they've been at war in the past, as David pointed out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1176" target="_blank">00:19:36.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So, and I'm not, I'm certainly no expert.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1178" target="_blank">00:19:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">By the way, I find this ship to be amazing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1180" target="_blank">00:19:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It's since it's since transited, but this is one of the ships that was there yesterday, just going for it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1185" target="_blank">00:19:45.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you look at the destination, it says armed guard on board as they set that in the AIS GPS transponder.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1193" target="_blank">00:19:53.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So that if anyone comes after him, you know what you're going to get.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1196" target="_blank">00:19:56.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I have two comments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1197" target="_blank">00:19:57.900</a></span> | <span class="t">When I looked at this in the last couple of days, that was sort of my takeaway, which is that the really significant impacts are downstream to Europe consumer prices.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1208" target="_blank">00:20:08.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think like European inflation has more chance of upticking again than America does.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1216" target="_blank">00:20:16.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Because I think the practical reality is what you said, Ryan, they'll just, the need to ship is inelastic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1222" target="_blank">00:20:22.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so they'll just pay 8% more and they'll just go to the East Coast in a more, in a longer way through the Cape of Good Hope or whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1229" target="_blank">00:20:29.300</a></span> | <span class="t">The second comment I think to me is a little bit more macro in nature, which is if you look at what's happening now, there's a hot war in Israel and Gaza.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1243" target="_blank">00:20:43.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And theoretically now there's a hot war in Yemen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1246" target="_blank">00:20:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the positive take on this is that it actually puts the Middle East in a position to resolve all of these things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1255" target="_blank">00:20:55.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And what I mean is the following, if you're Saudi Arabia, or if you're the UAE, or if you're Qatar, what you really want to do is build for the next 30 to 40 years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1264" target="_blank">00:21:04.900</a></span> | <span class="t">They've said it as much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1266" target="_blank">00:21:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They want to pull trillions of dollars of oil and that gas out of the ground.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1270" target="_blank">00:21:10.200</a></span> | <span class="t">They want to monetize it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1271" target="_blank">00:21:11.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And then they want to invest in their people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1273" target="_blank">00:21:13.500</a></span> | <span class="t">The last thing they need is to be bookended by two hot wars, largely propagated by a third party actor in Iran.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1280" target="_blank">00:21:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I think if there was not resolve for them to get aligned, I think that the resolve now really amps up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1287" target="_blank">00:21:27.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Saudi Arabia doesn't want to be in the middle of this nonsense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1291" target="_blank">00:21:31.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Qatar doesn't want to be in the middle of this nonsense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1293" target="_blank">00:21:33.500</a></span> | <span class="t">UAE does not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1294" target="_blank">00:21:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the fact that Canada, America, Britain, France are now all of a sudden pulled in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1300" target="_blank">00:21:40.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And China, as you said, Ryan, I didn't even think about the implications to China as a supplier of record for most of these goods.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1307" target="_blank">00:21:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All roads, I think, lead, in my opinion, to a coming together of folks to say, okay, let's use this as a definitive moment to just clean the decks here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1317" target="_blank">00:21:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that that'll put a lot of pressure on Iran, a lot of pressure on the money flows.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1322" target="_blank">00:22:02.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I suspect that both of these two hot wars get resolved quickly because the larger multi-decade implications for the Middle East are too big to let it be subsumed by the Houthi rebels or Hamas.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1333" target="_blank">00:22:13.900</a></span> | <span class="t">It's interesting here how you see like Israel is a relatively small economy in the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1338" target="_blank">00:22:18.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, you start to see in the same way that Ukraine is not a big economy, Russia is not that big, but it has a massive, the war there has just a massive impact via the commodities markets because Russia is such an important supplier of commodities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1351" target="_blank">00:22:31.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And now you see what, you know, Israel and Gaza are relatively small, potentially a small regional conflict, big global implications because of everything that goes behind it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1361" target="_blank">00:22:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But now you see this spread to something that really could impact if this is an extension of that conflict.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1366" target="_blank">00:22:46.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Now you're saying, wow, this actually has the ability to extend to global markets in a way that's similar to what happened in Russia and Ukraine, where all of a sudden commodity markets are impacted and you're seeing that inflation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1377" target="_blank">00:22:57.500</a></span> | <span class="t">But I don't know, Chamath, if your view is, hey, we're going to have progress because progress is good or something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1383" target="_blank">00:23:03.400</a></span> | <span

true.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1394" target="_blank">00:23:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Multi decade, multi trillion

is in a really tough spot here, because what happened is after the Houthis deposed the monarch there in 2014, Saudi Arabia started fighting a war to restore the leader in 2015.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1422" target="_blank">00:23:42.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And that war went on for almost a decade, created a huge humanitarian crisis, really underreported compared to other crises.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1430" target="_blank">00:23:50.300</a></span> | <span class="t">There were hundreds of thousands of civilians who were killed, millions of people displaced, went hungry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1434" target="_blank">00:23:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Finally, that war again, got paused by a fragile ceasefire that was negotiated, I guess, in the last year or so.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1443" target="_blank">00:24:03.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And then simultaneous to that, there was a rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iran that was brokered by China.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1452" target="_blank">00:24:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the last thing Saudi Arabia wants to do is get involved in restarting this war or restarting hostile relations with Iran.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1461" target="_blank">00:24:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, they would like to move beyond that, which is why they're not participating in this Operation Prosperity Guardian.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1467" target="_blank">00:24:27.300</a></span> | <span class="t">The problem they have is that the Houthis aren't going to stop doing what they're doing until Israel's war in Gaza stops.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1475" target="_blank">00:24:35.600</a></span> | <span

situation would go away very, very quickly and shipping, normal shipping would be restored.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1493"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1498" target="_blank">00:24:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, the Israelis seem pretty determined not to agree to a ceasefire.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1502" target="_blank">00:25:02.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the Biden

I think they would like this problem to be over.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1507" target="_blank">00:25:07.100</a></span> | <span class="t">But with the continuation of hostilities in Gaza, you continue to have the potential for the second order effects, these kind of knock on effects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1515" target="_blank">00:25:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And like I mentioned, one is the is the Houthis, another are all these American bases that are under attack right now by the Shia militias.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1523" target="_blank">00:25:23.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think this has the potential to be a black swan in 2024, meaning that somehow the Israel Hamas war spirals into a larger regional war that pulls the US in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1534" target="_blank">00:25:34.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not saying that's going to happen, but I think the potential is there the longer this goes on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1538" target="_blank">00:25:38.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that if that does happen, there could be the potential for an oil shock.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1542" target="_blank">00:25:42.760</a></span> | <span class="t">By the way, the Houthis have said that if the US attacks Yemen, they will light the Saudi oil fields on fire.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1550" target="_blank">00:25:50.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I'm not sure they have the potential to do that. I mean, presumably, if they had the potential to do it, they would have done it during their long war.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1555" target="_blank">00:25:55.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So that probably is just, you know, hyperbolic rhetoric. But there's so many ways for this to somehow turn into a larger Middle Eastern war.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1564" target="_blank">00:26:04.540</a></span> | <span class="t">To your point, Shamath, I think, you know, I've been meeting with folks in Doha and Riyadh and Abu Dhabi and Dubai for the last six months.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1573" target="_blank">00:26:13.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was talking to people this past weekend. You're absolutely right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1576" target="_blank">00:26:16.540</a></span> | <span class="t">There are a group of people with an agenda, which is to modernize the economies there, to move off petro, and to move into technology, and to move into hospitality with the neon project, as you pointed out, Ryan, and that's not going to get derailed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1590" target="_blank">00:26:30.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And those are the most powerful, you know, deep pocketed influential forces there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1595" target="_blank">00:26:35.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, yeah, they're working with the United States and any of these rebels, etc. I think they're going to be dealt with, because people want prosperity, and they want to keep evolving these societies and moving them forward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1609" target="_blank">00:26:49.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And normalization.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1610" target="_blank">00:26:50.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Normalization, yeah.

And obviously, Dubai's already been changing, and then Doha.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1631" target="_blank">00:27:11.540</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not arguing that Saudi Arabia isn't a great place, and they want to do the right thing here, but you're acting like the Houthis can just be dealt with. What does that mean to you?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1641" target="_blank">00:27:21.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I think that the larger forces are united in wanting to have prosperity for their people, education for their people, and to build deep ties with the West and the East to do commerce.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1654" target="_blank">00:27:34.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I think those forces are greater than maybe some of the traditional forces that are at work, and these longer term conflicts maybe are not as important to the leaders and the citizens of these countries as prosperity is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1668" target="_blank">00:27:48.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And so when I say dealt with, I think they're going to just focus on developing their economies over these skirmishes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1675" target="_blank">00:27:55.540</a></span> | <span class="t">But are you saying there's going to be a diplomatic solution here? Because I don't see it. I mean, here's the problem. Israel's not stopping its war in Gaza. The Houthis aren't going to stop until Israel stops. So how do you make them stop?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1686" target="_blank">00:28:06.540</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a great question. Containing these conflicts is probably the likely scenario, and I've asked that same question to the people who are in those regions. And when I spoke to them, they're all about containment. They don't think there's a resolution, like we might think about it here in the West, that there's not going to be a conflict between Palestinians and Israelis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1707" target="_blank">00:28:27.540</a></span> | <span class="t">They just think containing it and having it not be an all out war is success. What do you think is going to happen? I mean, at some point, the US isn't going to support...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1716" target="_blank">00:28:36.540</a></span> | <span class="t">We have two sides who are implacably resolved. The Israelis to continuing their fight against Hamas, and the Houthis to continuing to lash out at Israel or the West in general until that stops.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1729" target="_blank">00:28:49.540</a></span> | <span class="t">The likely scenario is that Netanyahu is losing support. That's what every Israeli and every person in the region says, is that Netanyahu is not going to last long term. So what have you heard, Sax? What do you think the resolution is?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1741" target="_blank">00:29:01.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I think it's interesting. If you look at Israeli domestic politics, it's true that Netanyahu is unpopular, but something like 90% of the Israeli public favors the continuation of this war until Hamas is eliminated. I mean, the Israeli people are really, I think, hardened on this question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1759" target="_blank">00:29:19.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Those tapes of Hamas atrocities on October 7th were compiled into a film. They were recorded by the Hamas fighters' own GoPros. And the Israeli people have watched all those things, and they are resolved to destroy Hamas.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1775" target="_blank">00:29:35.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, you can argue with their tactics, and I'm just stating the fact, okay? I'm not judging it. And the point is just whether Netanyahu survives or not, I think the Israeli public wants to eliminate Hamas. So I think they are resolved. I think the Houthis are resolved.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1790" target="_blank">00:29:50.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And the Houthis control this choke point so they can stop or interfere with global trade. And I think, look, there could be a ceasefire. I mean, I think Biden clearly would like there to be a ceasefire, certainly before the election.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1803" target="_blank">00:30:03.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And that would bring all this to a rapid end. But if there's not a ceasefire, I don't understand how you just stop the Houthis. I mean, the only way to stop them is if you want to go to war with them. That's what we're talking about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1815" target="_blank">00:30:15.540</a></span> | <span class="t">We're talking about the US using its naval assets to go get the regions Shabath mentioned could use diplomacy and or financial measures. And so those are other options on the table.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1827" target="_blank">00:30:27.540</a></span> | <span class="t">That's not going to work with the Houthis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1828" target="_blank">00:30:28.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, no easy solutions here, Ryan, thanks for jumping on the pod with us once again. One question, how much more resilient post COVID, if at all, our supply chains because you talked about wanting to make them more resilient. And that was a major focus for Flexport. How is it better now post COVID? Have we done?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1847" target="_blank">00:30:47.540</a></span> | <span class="t">I think at the physical infrastructure layer, nothing's really changed. I don't think you know, the bottlenecks have gone away just because demand went back down. The US had like a 20% increase in container volume, it created all these bottlenecks, we couldn't process that many containers in our ports.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1861" target="_blank">00:31:01.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the containers now are back at 2019 levels, and everything's flowing normally. But I wouldn't say that makes us more resilient. It's the same as before. And situations like this, you learn just how amazing and resilient the global trading network is the global logistics infrastructure, but also it's pretty fragile.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1879" target="_blank">00:31:19.540</a></span> | <span class="t">If a small group of rebels can fire missiles, and you go, well, even the US Navy, what are we going to do? I mean, it's kind of an asymmetric warfare type thing. They shoot a $20,000 drone, we need a $2 million missile to shoot it down. Like it's not a, it's not a great setup. And it's not clear that firing missiles back is going to open it back up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1899" target="_blank">00:31:39.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And so yeah, I think I think it's much more fragile. And we realize as civilization always has been, you know, it takes takes 100 years to develop a civilization and, and an afternoon to go back to barbarisms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1910" target="_blank">00:31:50.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And air freight you had talked about previously, that's still four or five times more expensive than sea freight. Is that about right that multiple?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1918" target="_blank">00:31:58.540</a></span> | <span class="t">In general, that's a reasonable assumption is about four times where the air freight networks are very small in proportion to give you a sense like one of these container ships that flows through the ever given is the world's most famous container ship that got stuck in the Suez Canal a few years ago, that one holds about 10,040 foot containers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1934" target="_blank">00:32:14.540</a></span> | <span class="t">747, which is basically the biggest cargo plane out there can hold 740 foot containers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1941" target="_blank">00:32:21.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And so if you have a diversion of global ocean freight will rapidly flow over to it doesn't take a lot of freight going, hey, I'm going to ship this by air instead, to suddenly have the air freight markets get impacted.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1951" target="_blank">00:32:31.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So it hasn't yet the air, the airlines are a little bit less connected to this market and haven't instantly said, hey, we're raising prices in January.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1960" target="_blank">00:32:40.540</a></span> | <span class="t">But I suspect if this lasts another week or two, you're going to see big run ups in air freight prices.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1964" target="_blank">00:32:44.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And these are global markets, the price of freight from Asia to the US gets impacted because they're pulling ships off the supply gets redirected, the planes get rerouted.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1973" target="_blank">00:32:53.540</a></span> | <span class="t">It is a global market. So an impact here will affect prices of shipping Asia to us as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1978" target="_blank">00:32:58.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Thanks so much for coming back on the program.

And thanks for coming on as SACS is lifeline. Well done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2004" target="_blank">00:33:24.540</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, guys, take care.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2005" target="_blank">00:33:25.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Ryan did bring up a really interesting point there that you don't hear enough, which was the asymmetry of the warfare that the hoodies can launch a drone or a cheap missile that costs 1000s of dollars, and it costs us millions of dollars to shoot it down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2018" target="_blank">00:33:38.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, that is just not sustainable for the US. We see this happening in Ukraine as well, all these, you know, multimillion dollar expensive tanks get taken out by a landmine or by a cheap, you know, RPG or something like that, that costs a few $1,000.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2034" target="_blank">00:33:54.540</a></span> | <span class="t">It's also the fact that if you send a drone and it blows up on a ship, and it costs you a couple 1000 bucks to do that, the lack of risk tolerance, the fact that the insurance companies won't insure the ship anymore, means that now that ship can't travel, and that's 10s of millions of dollars of, you know, commerce that gets shut down off of a few $1,000 investment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2055" target="_blank">00:34:15.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's, there's a deep asymmetry in the sensitivity we also have to loss, we you know, we won't take a well, maybe one in 10 ships can blow up, let's keep going. It's the fact that there's no margin for loss, there's no allowance for loss. As a result, any sort of threat of loss means that the whole system shuts down. I'm not advocating that we should, but it's just the condition we're in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2075" target="_blank">00:34:35.540</a></span> | <span class="t">I also think the other point I didn't make, I would imagine that this behavior with the Houthis is driven in part by the emboldenment that arises following October 7, and the praise that Hamas has received globally. And if you believe that to be true, there are many other groups like this that may get emboldened, and you start to see more activity in other regions as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2100" target="_blank">00:35:00.540</a></span> | <span class="t">That you can have these kind of outsized impacts and folks suddenly, you know, start to take action.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2108" target="_blank">00:35:08.540</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think that's why we're between a rock and a hard place here is that on the one hand, if we don't do anything, then you're emboldening that behavior. And if you do do something, you're escalating the war.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2118" target="_blank">00:35:18.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, and to your point, you know, saying like, hey, the US is going to enter the war, I think that there may be this moment where it's not even an option, that the US is being provoked in a way that you can't say no, you have to, you know, maybe they end up having to act.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2131" target="_blank">00:35:31.540</a></span> | <span class="t">The guerrilla warfare aspect of this is super fascinating, because you can really do incredible damage to very expensive airplanes with hypersonic missiles that go incredibly fast, or like Mach 5 or something insane, and they're cheap. So $100 million or $20 million fighter jet can just be annihilated by a couple $100,000 in, you know, hypersonic missiles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2154" target="_blank">00:35:54.540</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, there's been a ton of M&A activity and M&A deals that have been canceled. Adobe Figma has been called off. And Illumina and Graal has been unwound as well. The big headline is that after a 15 month review process, Adobe and Figma called off their merger. We talked about it here multiple times, it was a $20 billion cash in stock merger that was agreed to back in September of 2022.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2181" target="_blank">00:36:21.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's tons to unpack here, shareholders, employees, a startup ecosystem, and of course, limited partners who were expecting huge paydays from Figma being sold to Adobe are now back to a waiting game of figuring out if this company can go public, etc. Chamath, you had tons of thoughts on this, and maybe you could educate everybody on the Illumina Graal deal, since I don't think people understand that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2209" target="_blank">00:36:49.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. I think there are three deals, or almost deals that got essentially called off or canceled or never consummated in the last few weeks, which show a pretty interesting trend. So the first, as you said, Jason was Adobe Figma. The second was Cigna and Humana. They were proposing a multi decade billion dollar merger.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2234" target="_blank">00:37:14.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was very clear that the FTC was going to have a huge fit around it. So they said that we're not even going to do it. And then Cigna just said they'll do a $10 billion buyback instead. And then in the craziest example, Illumina and Graal. So Illumina makes these gene sequencing machines and Graal makes one of the leading tests for free DNA cancer detection.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2260" target="_blank">00:37:40.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And at the time, Illumina owned almost half the company, they bought the other half, they merged it in, even though the regulator said, Hey, hold on, we have an issue with this. And now they're being forced to unwind the merger. So to pull this company back out and divest it. I think the point of this is two things. One is that there is no viable M&A path for early stage venture capital businesses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2289" target="_blank">00:38:09.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you can't have a $20 billion merger or a $40 billion merger or 15 or $20 billion M&A with a high degree of confidence, then the path to liquidity through M&A is less than 20% of the outcomes, which means that the overwhelming path to get liquid is what you said, Jason, which is IPO.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2307" target="_blank">00:38:27.540</a></span> | <span class="t">But the problem is the second part, which is that the capital markets in the United States are not ready. We're not in a position to support all this IPO liquidity. Why? The banks won't underwrite. There aren't enough researchers, research analysts that will cover these stocks, the ways in which the banks make money have become so constrained.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2329" target="_blank">00:38:49.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I'm kind of left pondering to myself, how do you go back to a world of like the 90s, where startups four and five years old would go public to raise capital? I don't think that that's going to happen. So I don't know exactly what happens to us, except that we'll have companies gestating for 15 and 20 years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2348" target="_blank">00:39:08.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that just has a chilling effect because it's like what investor wants to put money away locked up in highly liquid stuff for 20 years? What rate of return do you need to give them that makes them want to do that? So something has to change because if the M&A market can't exist, then we need to change the rules of the capital market so that there's incentives for these banks to underwrite these companies to go public.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2368" target="_blank">00:39:28.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I guess there's two things that could change this dramatically. One is if we put in more conservative, Republican, libertarian, etc., less regulatory regime in Washington, that could open up M&A, you know, as soon as 2025, perhaps. And then the second is direct listings, dare I say SPACs and alternative ways to get companies public.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2392" target="_blank">00:39:52.540</a></span> | <span class="t">It may not be the gold standard as a traditional IPO, but at least we get those liquidity started. And I guess third, Saxon, I'll get your thoughts on this for private investors in their LPs. Everybody seems to be focused on building strong, stable, cash flowing businesses. And we've seen all the companies that went public, whether it's Airbnb or Uber, are now focused on ringing the cash register and being profitable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2420" target="_blank">00:40:20.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So ultimately, maybe this logjam and M&A blockage makes everybody focused on sustainable, profitable companies. And that's a good thing long term. What do you think, Sax?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2429" target="_blank">00:40:29.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Look, like I said last week in relation to the Figma Adobe deal, the fact that regulators took 15 months to analyze the deal only to come to the conclusion that they basically weren't going to allow it, and then Adobe finally killed it, is going to have a chilling effect on M&A and Silicon Valley. I mean, if acquirers and targets can't have confidence that the deal will be approved, and in fact, they're going to be left in limbo for over a year, waiting for speculative approval, they're going to be less likely to do deals in the first place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2457" target="_blank">00:40:57.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm sure Adobe's not happy about the fact they got to pay a billion-dollar breakup fee, which, by the way, was a really smart thing for Figma to negotiate. I mean, if you're a company that's going to get acquired, you need a pretty big breakup fee now as insurance on the deal, because there's a very good chance that regulators aren't going to allow it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2473" target="_blank">00:41:13.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So, yeah, absolutely, the fact that regulators got in the way of the Adobe deal, and moreover, the way that they did it with this protracted delay, is absolutely going to have a chilling effect on M&A and Silicon Valley. And look, there are only two good outcomes for a startup. You can either IPO or you can get acquired. That's it. The third is basically you go out of business. That's the third outcome.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2496" target="_blank">00:41:36.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So, when you take half the potential exits off the table, you're absolutely making it tougher for VCs and founders to get a good return. It's that simple. And that is going to have a depressing effect on the investing of risk capital in Silicon Valley. I don't think it's a good thing for anyone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2513" target="_blank">00:41:53.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And by the way, even if the US sort of fixes this, even if we get a regime that's more friendly towards M&A, you still have the EU to worry about. And you also have the UK to worry about because they're not part of the EU thanks to Brexit. The UK, like I said last week, they're like the Chihuahua who's leading the pack. They're the smallest market, but they're the most aggressive on antitrust enforcement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2535" target="_blank">00:42:15.540</a></span> | <span class="t">They may just be the beard for the US and the Europeans.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2538" target="_blank">00:42:18.540</a></span> | <span class="t">It's possible. But in any event, now you've got three regulators to worry about, not just one. And like I said last week, I think if you're a startup and you're trying to consider where to put your Europe office, I would not choose the UK anymore. I used to think that the UK was number one because it was so easy, but you don't want to create that nexus if you can help it. It might subject you to a competition authority you don't want to deal with later when you get acquired.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2562" target="_blank">00:42:42.540</a></span> | <span class="t">I would have just opted out of the UK. I would have called their bluff. As I said last week, Freeberg, any solutions here you think to solving this problem in VC land? Or do we just have to build stronger, more profitable companies and be more patient about taking them public since M&A is not on the table?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2577" target="_blank">00:42:57.540</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know if I'd take the antitrust regime as being the core driver of M&A not being on the table. I mean, there's a couple of these examples, but I don't think there's a predominance of this going on. I think that there's a lot of smaller deals that still end up being good outcomes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2594" target="_blank">00:43:14.540</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, we've, we've also talked a lot about the lower cost of capital and starting software businesses in the era of AI type tools. And that leads to, you know, being able to hit 100x if you put, you know, small enough amount of capital in and have a decent outcome where you're not building the market monopoly in some particular market.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2617" target="_blank">00:43:37.540</a></span> | <span class="t">It doesn't feel to me like that's the biggest driver of concern here. The biggest driver of concern is just all the return on capital metrics that the big buyers are having to face. You know, return on invested capital is becoming more important than it's ever been, because we're talking about trillion dollar market cap buyers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2635" target="_blank">00:43:55.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's how they're measured. And so they have to be really thoughtful about how they're deploying capital in a high interest rate environment. That's there's a greater sensitivity to a faster path to cash returns than there has been historically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2649" target="_blank">00:44:09.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So it feels to me like that's and I would imagine if I'm Adobe, and I'm looking at this figma deal, do I keep fighting it? Or at this point, paying a billion dollars is probably net accretive to them. I think the stock price went up when they called the deal off, which highlights that it was probably a better investment for them to say, I'm going to pay a billion dollars to actually get out of this deal at this point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2667" target="_blank">00:44:27.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think we see more of that happening, which is this rationalization of, you know, timelines to ROIC in a high interest rate environment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2674" target="_blank">00:44:34.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Chamath deals do get done a lot more tolerance for smaller deals, obviously.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2677" target="_blank">00:44:37.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I mean, Salesforce was able to acquire slack. That was 2020. Amazon was able to acquire Whole Foods, Walt Disney, 21st Century Fox with the x men.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2687" target="_blank">00:44:47.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So those are a different era. I really think these are all 2016 to 2020. You're right. Those are all very different era. I don't think that that's what you can expect anymore. I don't think you can underwrite to get a $20 billion deal done in any industry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2700" target="_blank">00:45:00.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, remember, matter of Facebook buying WhatsApp for was it 17 billion? I mean, that was one of the biggest venture returns ever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2707" target="_blank">00:45:07.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Today, that could never happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2710" target="_blank">00:45:10.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And that that Figma Adobe deal, it was a $20 billion deal. But with the rise in Adobe stock, it's really a $30 billion deal if it would have been consummated, because half the consideration was in Adobe stock, and that has basically doubled.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2725" target="_blank">00:45:25.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So all of those investors and employees were looking at a $30 billion exit. And look, Figma is going to do great. I think the numbers that came out about Figma, where they're going to do about 700 million of ARR, growing 40%. So I don't know, they'll be able to IPO anytime based on that. But what's the multiple they're going to get? Probably 12 to 15 times.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2748" target="_blank">00:45:48.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Eight to 10.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2750" target="_blank">00:45:50.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe it's like a $10 billion company in the public markets. I mean, growing nicely. But it's just not as good an exit. I mean, that's a big, big haircut.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2758" target="_blank">00:45:58.540</a></span> | <span class="t">The positive to this is consumers or retail investors haven't been able to buy IPOs and get into companies earlier. So if people build stronger companies that are more capital efficient, then companies can go public earlier. As you alluded to, Chamath, where Microsoft, Apple, a lot of these companies back in the PC era, they used to go public in under a decade. And now it's always over a decade. So maybe this will make stronger companies that go public. And then if there's a regime change, and maybe people feel more frisky, they still have to get through Europe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2787" target="_blank">00:46:27.540</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, biotech is the only market that's always viewed going public as a transitory capital raising moment, right? Every biotech company that goes public, in America, at least, are startups, they're pure startups, it's pure risk capital. But the technology side has viewed it very differently. It used to be the same, right? And then it went to like, oh, we must be mature. And then it has to be growing really fast. And it has to be profitable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2816" target="_blank">00:46:56.540</a></span> | <span class="t">There was so many ands, ands, ands that the that at the end of all of that, there were just very few companies that qualified. And then by the time they did go public, they're 12, 13, 14, 15 years in, they're so long in the tooth that their best growth periods are beyond them. Now, a couple of companies have bucked that trend. But by and large, that's, that's the case. And I don't think that's to support what David, what SAC said is that's just unsustainable. You cannot, you will not have risk capital flow into the United States, if this is going to happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2845" target="_blank">00:47:25.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, this is going to be super challenging for founders, you got to build companies that are sustainable and can go public, because that's really the only path right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2856" target="_blank">00:47:36.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's exacerbated by what Friedberg said, which is then that that family office or that endowment, who can rip in a check as an LP to a fund can still get 567% can get corporate bond at core corporate yields at like eight, nine, 10%. Why take on 15 year illiquidity for oftentimes funds that return less than the S&P, which is the dirty little secret of Silicon Valley. It makes no sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2886" target="_blank">00:48:06.540</a></span> | <span class="t">It is going to be a challenging environment for some time to come. I think as we work this out. I mean, the thing that I find super interesting with the SPACs was like, you got to invest in some companies that were very early and speculative, like Joby. Now, how could a consumer ever make that kind of bet your mouth to bet on? And that wasn't one of yours, I know. But it was one of these like, incredible moments where you could bet on flying cars, literally as a consumer. And I think they're actually going to figure it out. I was tempted to buy it. And I've been tracking it for a long time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2914" target="_blank">00:48:34.540</a></span> | <span class="t">I've been tracking the stock. And I'm like, wow, if they actually make air taxis work. And it's kind of cool that the public can participate in that. And that's what they were saying when there weren't enough IPOs. And we had half the number of public companies. So I don't know if you have thoughts on it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2930" target="_blank">00:48:50.540</a></span> | <span class="t">The number of public companies, I think, has halved in the last 20 years. So are more public companies better than less? I don't know. I think that's kind of like a random statement. I think what is true is that the public markets used to be used for raising risk capital. But the public markets at the time also had a ton of research analysts, there would be a lot more coverage of these companies, there will be a lot more visibility, a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2959" target="_blank">00:49:19.540</a></span> | <span class="t">more checks and balances, because people would be meeting with management on a regular basis writing thoughtful research reports. All of that is constrained as the as the business of being on Wall Street has changed. So it's not enough to just all of a sudden have a bunch of companies go public if all of that supporting infrastructure isn't there. So this is what I mean by it's a catch 22. On the one hand, there's not there's there's no M&A. So you need to have more IPOs. But the banks will need to hire more people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2988" target="_blank">00:49:48.540</a></span> | <span class="t">That comes at a cost, which means that they're going to have to generate more revenue somehow, that comes at a cost to somebody else. And until that's figured out, you're not going to solve this problem. And instead, what's going to happen is folks will be less motivated to invest in the innovation economy, because there'll be no path to liquidity. And when you do invest, you'll invest much smaller amounts of money. And you'll make it as part of your risk allocation, a smaller piece of the overall pie.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3016" target="_blank">00:50:16.540</a></span> | <span class="t">What it also means is that if you're an entrepreneur, and you haven't started a company yet, you may want to seriously consider raising a friends and family round using these AI tools and trying to build a very different kind of business, slow and steady, profitable from day one. And that's never been rewarded by Silicon Valley VCs. But if the reward for VCs don't exist, then the VCs themselves won't exist.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3045" target="_blank">00:50:45.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you may want to start thinking about different ways to capitalize your business.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3050" target="_blank">00:50:50.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's interesting point you make. That is very subtle. So I just want to restate it here. The analysts who are covering companies like say, Joby, I'm just picking this air taxi company because I'm obsessed with it. If there's not an infrastructure, those analysts act in a way as a backstop or a bit of pressure on management, I think is what you're saying to hey, perform and we're checking on you and we're meeting with you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3075" target="_blank">00:51:15.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So without that, there's just a company sitting out there and nobody is asking them hard questions, and then making decisions to put a buy or sell rating on it. Is that correct? Maybe you could expand on that missing piece.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3086" target="_blank">00:51:26.540</a></span> | <span class="t">There is an evolution in the public market. So look, the public markets back in the 90s, was a bit of a rigged game where you could call a CEO, if you had his or her number, and they could tell you things that they didn't tell everybody else. And when you look at the folks in their 60s and 70s and 80s, who really turned it, I'm sorry, folks, but they profited massively from that information arbitrage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3111" target="_blank">00:51:51.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And that changed when there was a regulation called reg FD that got passed in America, which said regulation, full disclosure, what you tell one, you have to tell everybody. Right. And that was an attempt by the SEC to level the playing field. It was a very smart piece of legislation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3127" target="_blank">00:52:07.540</a></span> | <span class="t">But what that did was it constrain the touch points that a company would have with the public markets to a few organized events, right? Analyst conferences, research days, actually, banks are allowed to organize formal company dinners. And you'll get all these people together, analysts across the entire spectrum from Fidelity to Goldman Sachs to Morgan Stanley.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3151" target="_blank">00:52:31.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And the company has to perform to them. And those folks will write both internal and external reports that say buy, neutral or sell, right? That became the only check and balance to make sure that management was held accountable to the large swath of public shareholders, because otherwise, it's not Jason, you as a shareholder of Joby, quite honestly, have any say, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3173" target="_blank">00:52:53.540</a></span> | <span class="t">You you exert your pressure through the analyst who then represents the ability to influence your buying and selling decision. But if those analysts don't even exist, there is no feedback loop between management and the people that own the stock. And that's the problem we have today. There's not enough research coverage, there's not enough analysts, there's no organized way to keep companies held accountable. And so if you have a bunch more companies that go public without that infrastructure, it's very difficult.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3201" target="_blank">00:53:21.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Seems like there's an opportunity somewhere in there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3203" target="_blank">00:53:23.540</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, the big opportunity that I that I that I think should happen is that a bunch of these banks should actually use these AI tools, Jason to be crawling all these eight k's and 10 k's and all these filings and generate statistical measurements of all of these public companies that they make free and available to everybody. These things should be a bunch of dashboards and charts that are just out there for anybody to subscribe to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3229" target="_blank">00:53:49.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So that you can just do the initial work of having to parse through all of these filings, have it done by an AI by an agent from a bank who can train it properly. I think that would be an immense value to all shareholders. And I don't think it costs that much money. And I think it would be goodwill. Robin Hood could do this, it would be great goodwill to build a lot of trust and credibility with investors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3254" target="_blank">00:54:14.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So now that you're CEO of a company, how do you look long term at potential exits going public? What what is the the thoughts you have on this as you architect the company freeberg as the CEO?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3266" target="_blank">00:54:26.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Do not care about exits.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3268" target="_blank">00:54:28.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Don't care about expand on that. Yeah, explain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3270" target="_blank">00:54:30.540</a></span> | <span class="t">I just want to build a great business that makes great products for our customers. That's it. So if you do that, all these discussions around, you know, giving shareholders liquidity, I'm the I'm the main shareholder. So I don't need liquidity. I just want to build the business.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3287" target="_blank">00:54:47.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So how do you think about profitability then? Because if you have to fund it, or funding might be harder to come by? How do you think about funding over the next decade, this vision you have?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3298" target="_blank">00:54:58.540</a></span> | <span class="t">It freaks me out. You got to keep businesses capitalized. So there's definitely across businesses I'm on the board of are involved in universally a bias towards profitability.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3315" target="_blank">00:55:15.540</a></span> | <span class="t">I've seen a couple of decisions we've made at some companies to shift from making longer time cycle investments that may not pay off for many years where you had the luxury of doing that in a Zurp environment. And you could always get capital to fund anything that's multiple years away from realizing any sort of return to shifting towards a bias towards making things that can generate real revenue and real profitability in the near term,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3343" target="_blank">00:55:43.540</a></span> | <span class="t">keeping costs low and building from there. So it's definitely I'd say been a flip flop in the environment. It's why the biotech landscape is largely kind of dried up funding landscape has dried up significantly because most of the investment opportunities are those multi year out before you know if you have a return on your investment kind of investment cycles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3362" target="_blank">00:56:02.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the ones that do get funded are those that have a near path to profitability and where you can build some sort of cash generative service in the near term on the path to building a bigger product down the road.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3374" target="_blank">00:56:14.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So as you're strategizing, you're thinking, how can we get to cash flow positive break even whatever quicker, you're not strategizing, how do I get a huge multiple and get some dumb tiger money, whatever, no, no dictator, but they paid the highest prices at the end of the cycle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3389" target="_blank">00:56:29.540</a></span> | <span class="t">I've got enough wisdom at this point to tell you that if you don't have to raise venture capital, you're better off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3394" target="_blank">00:56:34.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Shamath, you also became a CEO, you have the I think it's hustle is your company. And that's profitable. And you're running it. I'm assuming for growth, but maybe profit first then growth. How do you think about those two dials? How much growth? How much profits?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3410" target="_blank">00:56:50.540</a></span> | <span class="t">We have the same belief that free broadcast, which is our job is just to make really great products for our customers. When I took over the business, we had to go through a difficult layoff and a rebasing of the business. But it's, it's a business that's growing kind of 45% a year, and it's profitable. And, and what I talked to the team is that, you know, we will reinvest our profits. And so we have an ambitious plan. And as long as we meet that we'll take some percentage of that profit and reinvest it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3439" target="_blank">00:57:19.540</a></span> | <span class="t">But I, like freeberg also have no plans for liquidity, I just want to build this thing to be as big as possible. And I don't want one single shred of pressure that isn't defined by our customers. And so by being profitable, we have complete control of the cap table, we can do whatever we want. And the people that benefit, frankly, are the employees, because they can get paid, and our ability to hire people without being subject to like pressure to raise a new round and set a new random</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3468" target="_blank">00:57:48.540</a></span> | <span class="t">valuation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3469" target="_blank">00:57:49.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So no unnatural acts, just no one customer profits. And so,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3473" target="_blank">00:57:53.540</a></span> | <span class="t">by the way, if I can grow for 10 years, if we can grow for 10 years at 40% a year, this will be a ginormous business.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3478" target="_blank">00:57:58.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So no trying to three acts and do it on naturally.

Because then you don't have any shareholder pressure to get liquid. And that can create contortions in what you do, and how you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3498" target="_blank">00:58:18.260</a></span> | <span class="t">operate the business. And second is, if you're going to raise capital,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3501" target="_blank">00:58:21.900</a></span> | <span class="t">if you set too high a valuation, if that becomes the bogey, you set yourself up for challenges, because now you've got to have a multiple on that valuation to satisfy investor return hurdles. And the higher the valuation, and you apply a multiple to that, the higher the exit has to be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3519" target="_blank">00:58:39.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And suddenly, all the options start to fade away, you can no longer have a modest exit that can do really well for employees and the founders and early investors, and it becomes a necessity that you have a massive outcome. And by the way, we see this now, in this post Zerp</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3535" target="_blank">00:58:55.540</a></span> | <span class="t">environment that a lot of businesses that raised a lot of capital at a very high valuation, and then you have this multiple compression that's just happened in the last two years, their valuation effectively, if they were to go public today or get sold is less than the capital they've raised. And that's the most extreme scenario where, you know, suddenly all the common shareholders get wiped out in terms of their return.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3555" target="_blank">00:59:15.020</a></span> | <span class="t">It's such a great point, like the thing that people used to say was, oh, it's a tech company. So we need to give it a premium. The problem is now everything's a tech company, to say you're a tech company is a meaningless statement that means nothing, you're a company, so that you're a company. So then there's no premium for being a company.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3571" target="_blank">00:59:31.420</a></span> | <span class="t">No, there's a premium for profits.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3574" target="_blank">00:59:34.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, there's a premium based on quality of revenue, which has to do with gross margins. I mean, obviously, in economics, obviously, a company that has 80% gross margins is different than a company that's 20% gross margin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3586" target="_blank">00:59:46.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Not if it's unprofitable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3587" target="_blank">00:59:47.460</a></span> | <span class="t">No, no, I totally get that. I'm just saying that you can normalize based on gross margin as opposed to the type of company it is. Sometimes we'll see a company that markets itself as a tech company only has 20% gross margins. That's an indication that something is wrong,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3602" target="_blank">01:00:02.380</a></span> | <span class="t">usually, or it's not truly a software company.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3604" target="_blank">01:00:04.780</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just a company.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3605" target="_blank">01:00:05.540</a></span> | <span class="t">That's just a company.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3606" target="_blank">01:00:06.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I think that's the way to look at it. High gross margin versus lower gross margin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3610" target="_blank">01:00:10.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Just to go back and answer your question, Jay Cal about how do you decide how much money to put into growth versus being profitable? I think the right answer to that is not to say there's some absolute amount of money you should burn given your round is to look at growth on an ROI basis or union economics basis. What is the return on the growth dollars you're spending?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3631" target="_blank">01:00:31.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And probably the best way to do that is to look at the payback on customer acquisition, how long does it take you to pay back your customer acquisition costs. And I think a lot of people don't do that analysis correctly, because they just look at the revenue they make from that customer, but you actually have to look at the marginal profit. So this is how the gross margin ties in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3651" target="_blank">01:00:51.300</a></span> | <span class="t">easy example is something like Spotify, Spotify, it costs $100 a year, and they were to acquire somebody for $100 a year, hey, they get to year two, it looks like you made $100 except Spotify has to pay a massive amount to the record label. So their margin isn't as high as maybe a SaaS company. And that's where the devil's in the details.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3667" target="_blank">01:01:07.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And overhead, and overhead,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3668" target="_blank">01:01:08.860</a></span> | <span class="t">you got to look at churn as well. So if that customer only lasts two years, and half the margin goes to the record companies, well, you can't count 100% of revenue. Now you're looking at I don't know what that's like, you're dividing by two twice. So it's effectively, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3686" target="_blank">01:01:26.220</a></span> | <span class="t">50 bucks of the 200. Let's say, what are you seeing in your in the companies you're funding? You're seeing profitable companies or revenue generating companies? What, like, are you telling folks, you got to grow and raise a big series? Are you telling folks, hey, take your time? And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3699" target="_blank">01:01:39.820</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah, it's a great question. We invested in 100 companies this year. It's more than I've ever done. That's the same amount I did in first seven years of my career. And 100% of the time, they are not expecting to raise, like some giant seed or series a they're raising just the amount of money they need. And they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3715" target="_blank">01:01:55.500</a></span> | <span class="t">keeping their expenses absurdly low. The biggest trend I'm seeing is outsourcing of talent. And so Americans, and I'm gonna make this like a huge anti American thing, but the level of entitlement, and the effort Americans are putting into jobs expecting 150k, let's say, and then offshoring a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3734" target="_blank">01:02:14.540</a></span> | <span class="t">developer, Latin America, Portugal keeps coming up Canada, they're all looking for what's the most efficient way for me to build a 10 person team, and then I'll see a burn rate of $30,000 with 10 people. I mean, how is that possible? Like, oh, our developers cost 22,000 are, you know, SDRs are 10. I'm like, how is that possible? Oh, we have two people in Manila, etc. Long way of saying efficiency, efficiency, efficiency, though, we have to get to break even with the money we just got. We're not expecting a second round of funding. And a lot of them are raising but 500k to 1.5</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3764" target="_blank">01:02:44.220</a></span> | <span class="t">million.

But AI may be the biggest disruptor to VC big time in the end, explain what you mean. I know what you mean. But I want the audience to understand say you raise a $2 million seed round. In the past, what you would do to your point, Jason is you would hire seven people at $200,000 each. Right. So now you have a $1.4 million burn. So you basically have and let's just say, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3793" target="_blank">01:03:13.860</a></span> | <span class="t">co work someplace, you have a year and a half. And so you're a pedal to the metal, right? You're basically trying to throw as much spaghetti against the wall as possible, see what sticks by as many ads, do whatever it takes, the money basically goes to AWS, and Facebook and a couple of other companies to Google. And then you hope that there's enough traction where somebody then writes you a 10 or $15 million Series A check. Now, if you take that same $2 million, you could have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3823" target="_blank">01:03:43.980</a></span> | <span class="t">three person team, four person team, half of them offshore, where they also use things like copilot, which is like a two to three x lever. Now, all of a sudden, they have the same 10 person team, and it costs $40,000. Exactly. And so now all of a sudden, they have four years. So why wouldn't they do that where they would still own 80% of that company, and all of a sudden, there is a potential to exit it for 50 million or 100 million.

Well, when I first set up Kraft,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4309" target="_blank">01:11:49.220</a></span> | <span class="t">we actually wrote into our LPA that we had the ability to incubate companies. And we had a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4313" target="_blank">01:11:53.300</a></span> | <span class="t">prearranged economic deal with our LPs on those incubations, because I didn't want it to come up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4318" target="_blank">01:11:58.420</a></span> | <span class="t">later. And then there's some conflict of interest between the management company and the LPs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4323" target="_blank">01:12:03.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's a predetermined deal. And we don't do a lot of these. Like I said, I guess there's been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4328" target="_blank">01:12:08.180</a></span> | <span class="t">three.

And then we realized-</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4351" target="_blank">01:12:31.460</a></span> | <span class="t">You needed it as an investor, right? You needed it as an investor to have these insights.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4354" target="_blank">01:12:34.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, we just needed this as an investor. And then what happened is that we saw founders</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4359" target="_blank">01:12:39.460</a></span> | <span class="t">started using SAS Grid as their dashboard to manage their companies between funding rounds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4365" target="_blank">01:12:45.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And we're like, "Oh, okay.

So basically, there was no dedicated,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4370" target="_blank">01:12:50.580</a></span> | <span class="t">verticalized business intelligence tool or dashboarding tool just for SAS companies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4375" target="_blank">01:12:55.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And the advantages of verticalizing are massive because when you know what kind of company it is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4380" target="_blank">01:13:00.980</a></span> | <span class="t">you can just give them all the dashboards out of the box.

Oh, like, like 15 grand,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5062" target="_blank">01:24:22.900</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, to do that was my exact number. It was 15,000. So just to give you a comparison here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5067" target="_blank">01:24:27.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Chamath, if you were to have a million dollar house, that would be 6% to be $60,000. So that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5075" target="_blank">01:24:35.300</a></span> | <span class="t">15,000 in legal costs for you to sell it, right? If I wanted to sell it to you directly. And that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5078" target="_blank">01:24:38.900</a></span> | <span class="t">what happened.

Is it true for commercial real estate as well? This is this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5094" target="_blank">01:24:54.740</a></span> | <span class="t">how it works? I don't know commercial commercial real estate is the same situation. So there's an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5098" target="_blank">01:24:58.740</a></span> | <span class="t">agent that represents the building the landlord, it's actually talk about this, then the buy side</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5103" target="_blank">01:25:03.620</a></span> | <span class="t">agent. So what is it? Buffett owns Berkshire Realty? What is that? That's just basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5109" target="_blank">01:25:09.300</a></span> | <span class="t">it's a residential broker, just like Coldwell Banker 24, just like all these other so it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5113" target="_blank">01:25:13.700</a></span> | <span class="t">stroking up this 6% big.

And he was super ecstatic, I think in 2020 or 21, when real estate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5134" target="_blank">01:25:34.900</a></span> | <span class="t">boomed. And he's like, we got this many sides of the business. It's a great business. You know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5138" target="_blank">01:25:38.580</a></span> | <span class="t">it's cash generative, such a great business. But that's the business you want to be on. But you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5142" target="_blank">01:25:42.420</a></span> | <span class="t">want to get as many sides as you can, you want to get on a sell side and buy side in the market,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5146" target="_blank">01:25:46.900</a></span> | <span class="t">and you just get 3%, depending on which side you're on.

But I do think that the sell</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5162" target="_blank">01:26:02.420</a></span> | <span class="t">side brokers do work in terms of having to market the property.

Like you're saying, Freeberg, I think it's flipped. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5172" target="_blank">01:26:12.820</a></span> | <span class="t">in terms of where the value is, I mean, no, you have to stage the house take pictures.

Yeah. Same thing has happened with MLS. It used to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5235" target="_blank">01:27:15.860</a></span> | <span class="t">proprietary access by the brokers to MLS. You couldn't even see it. Then you had sites like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5242" target="_blank">01:27:22.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Zillow basically give you direct access to MLS.

Have you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5262" target="_blank">01:27:42.740</a></span> | <span class="t">done a direct transaction sex?

But the reason they get it is because the brokers tell you, well, you're not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5380" target="_blank">01:29:40.580</a></span> | <span class="t">paying that the seller's paying that.
