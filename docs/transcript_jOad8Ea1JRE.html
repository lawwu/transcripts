And so I remember when we were at this beach hut talking about what to do, they said, "Oh, if you wanna do this snorkel, "it's a perfect time to do it." Because a snorkel was like a hundred something dollars per person for a boat snorkel tour, but this day was free.</p><p>And they're like, if you had a family of four, you saved almost $500. And so if that's the kind of activity you wanna do and you're comparing two hotels and they're about the same price, it's always worth calling and asking, are there any promotions for any of the activities at the hotel or anything like that?</p><p>Because whether the kids club is free, whether the activities are free, whether there's like super discounted happy hour drinks, whatever it is you wanna do on your trip, there might be some of those things that you just don't know about because for whatever reason, hotels don't always publicize them on their website.</p></div></div></body></html>
