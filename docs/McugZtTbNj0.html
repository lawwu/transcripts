newfound ambitions to one's life?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McugZtTbNj0&t=17" target="_blank">00:00:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Should

target="_blank">00:00:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Having them into my life made me realize some of the potential I had in me but left untapped.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

target="_blank">00:01:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I was trying to get tenure at that time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McugZtTbNj0&t=71" target="_blank">00:01:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">This was this period I've alluded to before where I had really taken my foot off the gas pedal in my writing career.</span></div><div

right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McugZtTbNj0&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So Deep Work, I finished writing Deep Work before my second was born.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McugZtTbNj0&t=88" target="_blank">00:01:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I

target="_blank">00:01:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I was working on it before he was born, but obviously it took me a long time to finish.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McugZtTbNj0&t=100" target="_blank">00:01:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Because he was born in 2014, the book came out in 2016, but I finished it in 2015.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McugZtTbNj0&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I kind of walked away.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McugZtTbNj0&t=109" target="_blank">00:01:49.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I do have memories of editing that book with a baby on my shoulder.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McugZtTbNj0&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I was like, "Okay, I need to take a break."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McugZtTbNj0&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And it wasn't until years later that I got going again on Digital Minimalism and A World Without Emails.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McugZtTbNj0&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So I remember taking my foot off the writing gas pedal.</span></div><div

become a very successful book,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McugZtTbNj0&t=129" target="_blank">00:02:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">but it was not a big deal when it came out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McugZtTbNj0&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I was not like I have to do today, doing publicity tours.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McugZtTbNj0&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I would do some podcast from our basement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McugZtTbNj0&t=138" target="_blank">00:02:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And that was basically it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McugZtTbNj0&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I wrote a couple of op-eds, but there was no big deal with that book coming out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McugZtTbNj0&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">It took up very little time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McugZtTbNj0&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I did not write new books.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McugZtTbNj0&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I wasn't getting after it with Let's Get Going.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McugZtTbNj0&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">When I saw that Deep Work had traction, I wasn't saying like, "Let's go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McugZtTbNj0&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">We got to get some new books out of here right away."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McugZtTbNj0&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So I remember that as being a pretty slow period where all I wanted to do was focus on getting enough research done that I could get tenure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McugZtTbNj0&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I just really remember that's what I was focused on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McugZtTbNj0&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Then a couple of years later, I put my foot back on the gas pedal again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McugZtTbNj0&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean at some point, I remember having this conversation with my agent where I basically said, "I'm ready to work."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McugZtTbNj0&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's when we turned around and wrote a proposal for digital minimalism and a world without email.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McugZtTbNj0&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I said, "Look, I'm going to write these beasts back to back. Let's roll."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McugZtTbNj0&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">As soon as I finished the first one, I'll go into the second one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McugZtTbNj0&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I think seasonality matters with kids.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McugZtTbNj0&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Professional ambitions, let's go up and down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McugZtTbNj0&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I think you're in a period now where you want a good steady state.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McugZtTbNj0&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">It's also a great time to daydream and let me read and think.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McugZtTbNj0&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And these kids are going to open up, as you noted, they're going to open up a new understanding of your world and your potential and what's important to you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McugZtTbNj0&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Tap into all of that daydream plan, figure out things you might do, read inspiring things, watch documentaries.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McugZtTbNj0&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But I would say wait to put the foot down on that gas pedal until maybe things are going to seem a little bit calmer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McugZtTbNj0&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Finally, by the way, being a good dad to two young kids is a pretty ambitious thing to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McugZtTbNj0&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's not like you're stripping ambition from your life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McugZtTbNj0&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just you are focusing on a related ambitious project right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McugZtTbNj0&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">It just doesn't happen to involve how you make money.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McugZtTbNj0&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">[Music]</span></div></div></body></html>
