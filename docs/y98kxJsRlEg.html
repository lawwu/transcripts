We live in a day when individual autonomy, personal preference or choice,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98kxJsRlEg&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is considered by many to have priority over God's design.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98kxJsRlEg&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that may be because they don't believe in God, or more often because they don't believe God has spoken with any kind of governing clarity on an issue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98kxJsRlEg&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Either way, individual preference outweighs God. The reality of my desires has weight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98kxJsRlEg&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Most people feel they have weight in my life. God, He doesn't have any weight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98kxJsRlEg&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">For all practical purposes, He's inconsequential for our culture, whether He exists or not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98kxJsRlEg&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Very few people today in our culture are trembling before God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98kxJsRlEg&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Even though the Creator told us the fear of the Lord is the beginning, the beginning of wisdom.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98kxJsRlEg&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In other words, we can't even get to first base.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98kxJsRlEg&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We can't even begin to be wise in sexual identity where there's no trembling before the living God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98kxJsRlEg&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So an example of this amazing elevation of personal individual autonomy over God's designs in nature is the choice that parents are making.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98kxJsRlEg&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, this is happening. Parents are making today to use drugs to postpone puberty in their children so that their sons and daughters can make their own decisions about whether they want to grow up to be a man or a woman.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98kxJsRlEg&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So my question is, then, how shall we think biblically about these things?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98kxJsRlEg&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I'm just going to go to one place in the Bible to begin to lay a foundation that I think is absolutely essential.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98kxJsRlEg&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In Romans 1, 19 to 28, and the main thing to notice here is that the Bible draws a parallel between the way nature teaches truth about God and the way nature teaches truth about male and female sexuality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98kxJsRlEg&t=357" target="_blank">00:05:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the point is this, nature is one of God's methods of revealing what we should prefer, what our choices should be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98kxJsRlEg&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Preference or choice is guided by God's design in nature.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98kxJsRlEg&t=374" target="_blank">00:06:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not independent as though you can simply choose your own essence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98kxJsRlEg&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Whom we should worship is not left to our preferences, and who we are sexually is not left to our preferences.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98kxJsRlEg&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Both are dictated by God's revelation in nature.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98kxJsRlEg&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So look at the verse, verse 19, for example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98kxJsRlEg&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"What can be known about God is plain, because God has shown it to them, for his indivisible attributes, namely his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived in the things that have been made."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98kxJsRlEg&t=414" target="_blank">00:06:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, God's divine nature is revealed in physical, material things in the universe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98kxJsRlEg&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So much so that verse 20 says, "They are without excuse if they exchange the glory of God for the glory of the creature."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98kxJsRlEg&t=431" target="_blank">00:07:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In other words, it's clear in God's mind that what the universe, what material, physical universe teaches about God is clear enough about who he is and whom we should worship that we're without excuse if we don't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98kxJsRlEg&t=446" target="_blank">00:07:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Then, and this is the key thing for the transgender issue, then the text draws the parallel with human sexuality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98kxJsRlEg&t=454" target="_blank">00:07:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Just as physical nature reveals the truth about God, so physical nature reveals truth about sexual identity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98kxJsRlEg&t=463" target="_blank">00:07:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Verse 26, it goes like this, "Their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature, and their men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98kxJsRlEg&t=482" target="_blank">00:08:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, the one thing that I'm focusing on here is Paul's understanding of the role of nature, the material, physical reality of the universe and of our bodies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98kxJsRlEg&t=498" target="_blank">00:08:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And what he's saying is that the role nature has to reveal truth about God's identity as powerful and divine, it also has in revealing our identity as male and female.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98kxJsRlEg&t=514" target="_blank">00:08:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the basic gist of everything I'm saying from Romans 9, namely that the role nature has is to reveal truth about God's identity as powerful and divine and truth about our identity as male and female.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98kxJsRlEg&t=531" target="_blank">00:08:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's so clear that we are without excuse if we don't see it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98kxJsRlEg&t=536" target="_blank">00:08:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, if a human looks at the world and chooses to worship a creature rather than the Creator, he's without excuse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98kxJsRlEg&t=545" target="_blank">00:09:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And if a man looks at his own body and chooses to play the part of a woman, or a woman looks at her own body and chooses to play the part of a man, they are without excuse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98kxJsRlEg&t=556" target="_blank">00:09:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because in both cases, in divine worship and human sexuality, God has given nature, cosmological and biological, God has given nature as the revelation of his will.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98kxJsRlEg&t=571" target="_blank">00:09:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Humans should worship God, males should act like men, females should act like women.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98kxJsRlEg&t=578" target="_blank">00:09:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, back to Laverne Cox for just a moment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
