They think that it's annoying. And I think it's great. I love when people ask me questions. I think there's sometimes a stigma in companies where the people that ask the questions don't know anything. I think the opposite. As a matter of fact, the CEO of Wealthfront became the CEO because he asked such tough questions.</p><p>Every tech company typically has a weekly all hands, and there's always one or two engineers who ask really annoying questions. And they're annoying because they hit the raw nerve. There's usually an issue with every decision that a management team makes. And there's always one or two people who know how to find it.</p><p>And David Fortunato was the guy who always found the raw nerve. And after a year of taking these questions, I made him the CTO. at 25 and he's now our CEO and he's a much better CEO than I ever was.</p></div></div></body></html>
