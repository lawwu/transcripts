I would not trust somebody who is a generalist. I'll tell you very honestly, when we work in a market that we don't know so well, we work through a destination management company, a destination expert who really knows that little village, that little town and how to make things happen.</p><p>The reason for that is that the internet, ChatGPTNL, can kind of answer generic questions for you on a very high level about something. But when you wanna know what is the best bakery in a certain town and why, you need to go to a local. You need to go to somebody who has on-the-ground experience.</p><p>If you're staying at an Airbnb or a Vrbo, all the time, reach out to those hosts and say, "Hey, hi, this is who I am, this is my family, "this is what we're coming to do. "What do you recommend for X, Y, and Z? "We wanna wake up in the morning and go to do this.</p><p>"Is this a good idea?" We're staying in Monaco at the end of the month, and just for one night. And I'm like, we've got five hours basically to see all of the highlights of Monaco from a local's perspective. I don't wanna go to the casino only. I wanna do what a local would do.</p><p>How do you do that? I have an awesome itinerary back 24 hours later.</p></div></div></body></html>
