You buy that vast cosmological shift I was just describing, the utter disruption of everything you see that you call normal down to the leaves and the trees around you.</p><p>You believe that. Well, the same skepticism you're so fond of that argues against the rapture, can also be used to disprove this thing you believe that you think is probably pretty obvious, actually, now that I've pointed it out. OK, your skepticism, your skepticism disproves too much, my friend. That's actually a really good point.</p><p>It still leaves open the possibility of life, how it happens and when it happens, blah, blah, blah. But actually, that's that's a good point. OK, so a second, second thing. I'm not you set them up, I'll knock them down one after the other. (laughing)</p></div></div></body></html>
