And then also at the point where you have something that has the ability to have like creative new scientific hypotheses the way a human does, which is a debate over whether we should ever expect that and when, but once you have that I think you should figure there's just a lot of ways to get around all your other bottlenecks because you have this potentially massive population of thinkers looking for them.</p><p>And so an example is you could with enough fire power, enough energy, enough AI, enough analysis, you could probably find a way to simulate a lot a lot of the experiments you need to run, for example.</p></div></div></body></html>
