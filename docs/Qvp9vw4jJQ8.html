First, building</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=35" target="_blank">00:00:35.640</a></span> | <span class="t">agents is incredibly hard. There is a lot of iteration that goes on at the prompt level, at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=40" target="_blank">00:00:40.580</a></span> | <span class="t">the model level, at iterating on the different tool call definitions. For a lot of teams, this is what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=47" target="_blank">00:00:47.460</a></span> | <span class="t">their experience looks like. They're in an Excel sheet. They're swapping out different prompts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=52" target="_blank">00:00:52.980</a></span> | <span class="t">They're trying to figure out, did one prompt give them a better output</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=58" target="_blank">00:00:58.280</a></span> | <span class="t">than another prompt. Often, a lot of this is just based off of how it felt on a couple different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=64" target="_blank">00:01:04.120</a></span> | <span class="t">examples, and then they go live into production with that prompt. Part of this is that it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=70" target="_blank">00:01:10.600</a></span> | <span class="t">pretty difficult to actually systematically track where is this new prompt doing better than your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=77" target="_blank">00:01:17.900</a></span> | <span class="t">previous prompts? Where is this model doing better? And it's hard to actually include other people,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=83" target="_blank">00:01:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">people, especially if you have your product managers or your SMEs, actually a part of this iterative</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=88" target="_blank">00:01:28.580</a></span> | <span class="t">evaluation-driven process to how you actually want to think about improving your application.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it's hard to consistently figure out what makes your agent better. And it doesn't get easier</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=102" target="_blank">00:01:42.840</a></span> | <span class="t">once you actually deploy into production. It's pretty hard to understand, well, where's the bottlenecks in my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.880</a></span> | <span class="t">application? Is there a specific sub-agent or tool call that is kind of consistently creating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.680</a></span> | <span class="t">poor responses? How do I want to actually identify those bottlenecks? And then what do I actually need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.120</a></span> | <span class="t">to do to go fix it? And so today, I'm going to be diving into a little bit of the different components</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.800</a></span> | <span class="t">of how I think about agent evaluations. We're going to talk about some of the most common components,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.760</a></span> | <span class="t">which is evaluating at the tool call level, taking that one step further, going all the way to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=139" target="_blank">00:02:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">trajectory and looking at, did it actually maybe across an entire trace or did it actually call,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.600</a></span> | <span class="t">for example, all the tool calls in the right order? We're going to then not only look across the single</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.080</a></span> | <span class="t">trace, but then across multi-turn conversations. Because these interactions are no longer just kind of a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.800</a></span> | <span class="t">a single-turn experience. They're often multi-turn, keeping track of what happened in the previous</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.280</a></span> | <span class="t">interaction and keeping that in mind as context for the next turn of the conversation. So we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.320</a></span> | <span class="t">going to talk a little bit about that. And then I'm going to jump into kind of a, you know, approach</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.120</a></span> | <span class="t">that we've been really excited about, which is how do we get these agents to self-improve? And that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.600</a></span> | <span class="t">starts with not just thinking about the agent improving, but also your evals consistently improving.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So with that, let's jump in. I'm going to do a little bit of slides and then I'm going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.960</a></span> | <span class="t">jump into actually a real example. So you guys can actually see it in, in practice. So first,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.720</a></span> | <span class="t">we're going to talk a little bit about tool calling evals. Anyone who's building agents is probably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.760</a></span> | <span class="t">writing a lot of different tools and making sure that your agent has access to call all these different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.440</a></span> | <span class="t">tools depending on the action it needs to take. And pretty consistently, it's your, your agent needs to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.920</a></span> | <span class="t">probably make the decision of what's the right tool call to call in this specific scenario.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I have, you know, potentially contacts from previous part of a conversation or previous actions it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.760</a></span> | <span class="t">taken. And what do I actually need to call in order to kind of next continue whatever's happening in that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.320</a></span> | <span class="t">in that interaction? So not only do you have to pick the right tool call, but you also have to figure out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">from that conversation or context what's the right arguments to pass into that tool call.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it's pretty important to actually evaluate, did it call the right tool and did it pass the right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.720</a></span> | <span class="t">arguments into that tool call itself? And I'm going to go into a little bit of depth this and show you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.600</a></span> | <span class="t">how we think about evals actually from a product perspective. This is the Arise product. You can see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.480</a></span> | <span class="t">here, I'm actually tracing and looking at the traces of our own actually co-pilot here. So this is our own</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.120</a></span> | <span class="t">co-pilot and our own agent that actually think about it almost like an insights, a tool where teams can come</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">in and ask all sorts of different questions about where their application is doing well or not doing well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and use this to actually troubleshoot their application and suggest improvements. And like any great product,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.480</a></span> | <span class="t">we actually dog food our own tooling. And so these are actually the traces of different questions that users</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.520</a></span> | <span class="t">have asked us. And we actually evaluate these interactions so we can understand where our co-pilot's doing really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.320</a></span> | <span class="t">well and where it's actually not doing well. One thing that we actually like to look a lot at is not just kind of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=305" target="_blank">00:05:05.720</a></span> | <span class="t">individual traces, but actually starting at a little bit more of a higher level view where we can look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.320</a></span> | <span class="t">across all the different paths that, you know, all the different trajectories that our agent actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.560</a></span> | <span class="t">can go down. So in our case, this is actually the architecture of our agent. You can see here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.360</a></span> | <span class="t">we follow a little bit of an orchestration worker type pattern, where there's at the very high level,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.600</a></span> | <span class="t">a planner that decides based off of the information what to go down, and there's all sorts of different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.240</a></span> | <span class="t">tools that it can then call. And sometimes, depending on the output of those tools, it might need to call</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.200</a></span> | <span class="t">even another router or orchestrator to figure out, you know, what next tool call to actually call.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there's kind of multiple levels to this to actually make sure that ultimately we respond to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=355" target="_blank">00:05:55.320</a></span> | <span class="t">user in kind of a good way. With this specific agent of ours, you can see here that, you know, for me,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=364" target="_blank">00:06:04.920</a></span> | <span class="t">what I really think of a lot about is, well, at the planner level, the very beginning, is, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=371" target="_blank">00:06:11.960</a></span> | <span class="t">across all the different paths that this agent could go, where is it kind of doing really well? And are there any</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=377" target="_blank">00:06:17.320</a></span> | <span class="t">any bottlenecks in performance? And as I can look through some of this, it's, you know, there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.880</a></span> | <span class="t">evals around questions that are just related to, you know, generic questions of the users asking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=387" target="_blank">00:06:27.560</a></span> | <span class="t">It looks like we're actually not doing so well on search. I can see here, we're almost pretty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=393" target="_blank">00:06:33.480</a></span> | <span class="t">consistently doing, you know, it's about half and half of times we're getting it correct as we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=398" target="_blank">00:06:38.920</a></span> | <span class="t">getting it incorrect, which is not that great. So this is probably an area that I would dive into and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.480</a></span> | <span class="t">look at kind of the bottlenecks of, you know, where we're not doing so well when the user's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=408" target="_blank">00:06:48.520</a></span> | <span class="t">asking search questions. And it looks like there's other questions that we're actually doing, doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=413" target="_blank">00:06:53.480</a></span> | <span class="t">pretty good on.

So now when I go look inside of my traces, I can actually start with something like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=430" target="_blank">00:07:10.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the Q&A correctness and look at something like, well, I should probably care about in this case,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=439" target="_blank">00:07:19.640</a></span> | <span class="t">it was specifically the search Q&A correctness. So what I should probably go look at is for search</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=445" target="_blank">00:07:25.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Q&A correctness when it's incorrect. Let me go take a look at some of the examples of that and try</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=450" target="_blank">00:07:30.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to understand where what I'm doing wrong here. And so in this case, when I'm looking at these, I can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=456" target="_blank">00:07:36.520</a></span> | <span class="t">actually now drill and go into specific traces. And at this level, I have evals across the entire trace.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=464" target="_blank">00:07:44.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I have evals on the individual tool calls. And at the tool call level, I also have,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=472" target="_blank">00:07:52.200</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, not only did it call the right tool call, it says the function call is correct.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=477" target="_blank">00:07:57.080</a></span> | <span class="t">But I also have evals on did it actually pass all the right arguments. In this case, it looks like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=482" target="_blank">00:08:02.920</a></span> | <span class="t">that's where it's going wrong. It says, therefore, the arguments do not align with the required parameters</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=487" target="_blank">00:08:07.400</a></span> | <span class="t">leading to the conclusion that the arguments are incorrect. So I probably have an issue here where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=491" target="_blank">00:08:11.960</a></span> | <span class="t">even though I'm calling it looks like the right tool call out of all the different ones that I have,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=497" target="_blank">00:08:17.080</a></span> | <span class="t">it looks like maybe I'm not passing in the right arguments inside of my tool call based on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=502" target="_blank">00:08:22.920</a></span> | <span class="t">context of the conversation. So that's something that I should go fix. So this is kind of the first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.160</a></span> | <span class="t">big one that we think a lot about. The next one that is pretty interesting is also, you know, for a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=515" target="_blank">00:08:35.400</a></span> | <span class="t">of these, it's not just a single tool call that's made. It's many, actually. And you can kind of see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=520" target="_blank">00:08:40.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that when I'm showing you the way that our architecture is built. There's actually a lot of different,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=525" target="_blank">00:08:45.960</a></span> | <span class="t">even within the Q&A correctness, when we go down the search correctness path, there's actually a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=531" target="_blank">00:08:51.720</a></span> | <span class="t">of different sub tools that are even called here. So it's pretty important to not only get,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=537" target="_blank">00:08:57.880</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, you know, if it's individually calling a single tool correctly, but also is it getting the order of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=543" target="_blank">00:09:03.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the tools that it's supposed to call correctly? And that's really what, as we think about trajectory evals</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=548" target="_blank">00:09:08.040</a></span> | <span class="t">starts to, uh, starts to, it starts to become about is really, is it calling tool calls in the right order?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=555" target="_blank">00:09:15.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, if across a series of steps as needed for an agent to complete a task, is it consistently calling</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=564" target="_blank">00:09:24.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and executing them in the same set of steps or, and, and eventually converge on, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=570" target="_blank">00:09:30.440</a></span> | <span class="t">X number of steps to complete the section, or does it sometimes veer off and call it in a different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=576" target="_blank">00:09:36.360</a></span> | <span class="t">order and therefore require me to, A, have to spend a lot of tokens in order to do the same</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=582" target="_blank">00:09:42.200</a></span> | <span class="t">ask. Um, and then B, is it kind of messing up and providing wrong kind of outputs because of that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=588" target="_blank">00:09:48.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we recommend teams to actually drill in and look at, you know, across, not just an individual</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=595" target="_blank">00:09:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of a tool call, but actually looking across, um, an entire trace and looking at the order of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=601" target="_blank">00:10:01.320</a></span> | <span class="t">tool calls to see if that's actually done well. And then evaluating kind of is overall, in this case,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=607" target="_blank">00:10:07.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I have it incorrect. And so in this case, is it actually consistently getting the tool calling</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=612" target="_blank">00:10:12.200</a></span> | <span class="t">order correctness? Uh, uh, correct. Um, the next step here is, well, you can look across the single</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=619" target="_blank">00:10:19.080</a></span> | <span class="t">individual trace or interaction, but a lot of these interactions we're seeing with agents actually ends</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=623" target="_blank">00:10:23.800</a></span> | <span class="t">up being multi-turn. So in this case, I have like a three back and forth between a human and an agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=629" target="_blank">00:10:29.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's a lot of interesting questions you can actually ask at this stage. You can ask questions like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=634" target="_blank">00:10:34.680</a></span> | <span class="t">is the agent consistent in tone? Um, is the agent maybe asking the same question and again and again?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=642" target="_blank">00:10:42.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, in which case it's not really learning anything from the previous interactions that it's had with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=646" target="_blank">00:10:46.920</a></span> | <span class="t">the human. Um, and, and part of that is really, does it keep track of context from the previous kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=653" target="_blank">00:10:53.160</a></span> | <span class="t">n minus one turns in order to be able to answer the nth, uh, turn of that conversation really well. And so these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=660" target="_blank">00:11:00.120</a></span> | <span class="t">are all the types of questions to think about when you have something that, that is multi-turn.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=664" target="_blank">00:11:04.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'll actually show you an example from another project here where I do have kind of some of that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=671" target="_blank">00:11:11.240</a></span> | <span class="t">multi-turn interaction. Um, this may be one where I've kind of this back and forth with, with an agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=678" target="_blank">00:11:18.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And what I care about here across this entire conversation is, did I actually correctly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=685" target="_blank">00:11:25.400</a></span> | <span class="t">answer all the questions? Did I actually make sure I kept context so that I wasn't kind of missing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=690" target="_blank">00:11:30.440</a></span> | <span class="t">context that was made earlier in the conversation? And so deeply recommend folks to actually think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=695" target="_blank">00:11:35.720</a></span> | <span class="t">about the session evaluations as part of their evaluating of agents. Um, and then lastly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=701" target="_blank">00:11:41.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll kind of go through this and, um, I think this will be a good spot for us to, um, deep dive into,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=708" target="_blank">00:11:48.760</a></span> | <span class="t">which is we spend a lot of time, even just now on the tool calling trajectory session,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=714" target="_blank">00:11:54.760</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot talking about how to think about evaluating the agent or the application prompt. And this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=721" target="_blank">00:12:01.800</a></span> | <span class="t">really important. I mean, I, we could spend a whole deep dive on this itself, but it's really important</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=728" target="_blank">00:12:08.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to evaluate it correctly, identify where does it go wrong so that you can annotate or, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=735" target="_blank">00:12:15.640</a></span> | <span class="t">refine those outputs and use those to actually improve your existing prompt. And I think a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=741" target="_blank">00:12:21.480</a></span> | <span class="t">of teams actually totally get this and are doing this all the time to improve the agent prompt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=746" target="_blank">00:12:26.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, but what's really important is that the evals that you're actually using just kind of the crux of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=752" target="_blank">00:12:32.600</a></span> | <span class="t">how you identify those failure cases end up becoming crucial to calling out what you need to improve.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=759" target="_blank">00:12:39.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And you don't want those evals to remain static, the prompts for those evals for using LLM as a judge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=766" target="_blank">00:12:46.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there really is kind of another loop going on here, which is about improving the evals and the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=773" target="_blank">00:12:53.640</a></span> | <span class="t">eval prompts. And part of this is you're collecting, um, consistently checking the, the eval outcomes as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=781" target="_blank">00:13:01.560</a></span> | <span class="t">well to make sure it's not just the application that got it wrong, but it could have been the eval that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=786" target="_blank">00:13:06.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, miscorrectly labeled it as wrong. Um, and start to identify where the eval itself might need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=794" target="_blank">00:13:14.760</a></span> | <span class="t">some improvements. And similar to the process you did for the agent application, do a workflow where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=800" target="_blank">00:13:20.520</a></span> | <span class="t">you're iterating on the eval prompts, um, you know, building up a golden dataset, consistently refining it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=807" target="_blank">00:13:27.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And there really are kind of two iterative loops kind of going on at the same time, one for the agent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=814" target="_blank">00:13:34.120</a></span> | <span class="t">evaluations, one for, um, your, your agent application prompts, and then one for your eval prompts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=819" target="_blank">00:13:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And as you think about this, both of them kind of go hand in hand to actually create</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvp9vw4jJQ8&t=824" target="_blank">00:13:44.920</a></span> | <span class="t">a really good product experience, um, for teams.
