target="_blank">00:03:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now that is a dangerous comparison because she doesn't want to be in the category of the older brother.</span></div><div class="c"><span

<span class="t">But the problem with the older brother more deeply was that he related to his father like a slave instead of a son.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8BEv32dwv0&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He reminded his father, "How hard I've served you all these years," you could just

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8BEv32dwv0&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In other words, the problem with the older brother is not merely that he doesn't love his younger brother the way he should,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8BEv32dwv0&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.000</a></span> | <span

it gets insightful for her situation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8BEv32dwv0&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The parable of the prodigal son is the third of three parables that illustrate joy when a lost sinner is rescued by Jesus for the kingdom of heaven.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8BEv32dwv0&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In the first parable, there's the man who leaves 99 sheep behind, and he goes out and he finds one lost sheep,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8BEv32dwv0&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and it says, "There will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over 99 righteous persons who need no repentance."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8BEv32dwv0&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there's the woman in the next parable who has 10 coins.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8BEv32dwv0&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">She loses one, and she desperately sweeps all of her house, finds the coin, gathers her friends, and rejoices.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8BEv32dwv0&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And Jesus says, "Just so I tell you, there is joy before the angels of God over one sinner who repents."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8BEv32dwv0&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, that might sound like the situation Rachel is frustrated about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8BEv32dwv0&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The church throws a party for one amazing convert out of a life of flagrant sinning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8BEv32dwv0&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.000</a></span> | <span

in Luke 15 that one sinner who repents is more to be celebrated than 99 faithful Rachels?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8BEv32dwv0&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">No, that is not what it says.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8BEv32dwv0&t=355" target="_blank">00:05:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">These three parables are not about a church with 99 godly, faithful, lifelong Christians who know they need grace and who live by the mercy of God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8BEv32dwv0&t=367" target="_blank">00:06:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's not what these parables are about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8BEv32dwv0&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">These parables are about a dinner party where Jesus is eating with tax collectors and sinners surrounded by Pharisees who are ticked off that Jesus is offering his forgiving fellowship to sinners.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8BEv32dwv0&t=386" target="_blank">00:06:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The elder brother represents the Pharisees, not the faithful, humble, believing church member.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8BEv32dwv0&t=392" target="_blank">00:06:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And when Jesus refers to 99 persons who need no repentance, he's speaking ironically because there is no such thing as a person who needs no repentance, especially the Pharisees.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8BEv32dwv0&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But here's what I would say

saved,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8BEv32dwv0&t=433" target="_blank">00:07:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that we come to understand that

target="_blank">00:07:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a profound mistake to think that we can know the depth of our depravity by recalling our pre-conversion sins or that we can know the glories of grace by recalling that night when we were set free from drug addiction and sexual bondage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8BEv32dwv0&t=458" target="_blank">00:07:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That is utterly naive for pastors to think that way or people to think that
