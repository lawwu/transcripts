Can we trust AI?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=47" target="_blank">00:00:47.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Some of these systems are used in mission-critical applications, but the question really is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=55" target="_blank">00:00:55.700</a></span> | <span class="t">can we trust the inferences of these AI systems because they are impacting businesses,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=61" target="_blank">00:01:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">they're impacting business decisions, and the bottom line at the end of the day?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=64" target="_blank">00:01:04.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're going to explore that topic today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=67" target="_blank">00:01:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">With that, let me get us started.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=73" target="_blank">00:01:13.980</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. So, you know, just like any presentation, we'll start with some stats.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=78" target="_blank">00:01:18.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So, McKinsey is saying 78% of the companies are adopting AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.280</a></span> | <span class="t">There's another research from Evi says 95% investing in AI.</span></div><div

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=90" target="_blank">00:01:30.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Only 11% of the companies are focused on AI's governance, ensuring safe practices with AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So that 67% gap is going to be a huge problem because it's not just about implementing the AI in the right way,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.480</a></span> | <span class="t">it's also about understanding the impact of that AI in the long run.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=111" target="_blank">00:01:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And let me quantify that with some examples.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So you see a couple of examples here, telecom disruption.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.140</a></span> | <span class="t">What really happened here was AI made some decision.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=124" target="_blank">00:02:04.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Based on that, there was a network disruption.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, if you look at AT&T's and Verizon's of the world, they're spending millions of dollars each minute the network is not working.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Another example here is a gas sensor misinterpreted data that put human lives at risk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Third company lost millions of dollars because the supply chain company, AI, screwed up the SKUs and, you know, ended up in losses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So what we're trying to say here is that these are silent failures.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You cannot quantify the impact of these failures ahead of time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.700</a></span> | <span class="t">You cannot see them coming ahead of time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.440</a></span> | <span class="t">But they are worth millions and billions of dollars over time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is extremely, extremely impactful as AI is getting adopted.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So, taking a view of what trustworthy AI looks like, there are three main pillars.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.480</a></span> | <span class="t">You talk about explainability.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When you're talking about explainability, I think the most important thing is having a view of what's really under the hood.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Otherwise, you're just flying blind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You have to understand why those inferences are being made on what basis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.260</a></span> | <span class="t">The other thing is traceability.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.140</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like a flight recorder.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">It's capturing all the audit trails.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.640</a></span> | <span class="t">It's ensuring that you can retrace the steps.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And based on that, you can understand the particular situation, recreate the situation, and being able to solve it again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Guardrails are extremely important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.700</a></span> | <span class="t">They are to ensure that you don't end up in millions of dollars of losses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">There is some threshold where it stops.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.400</a></span> | <span class="t">The AI has got to stop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So, together, all of these build trust in a real system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.220</a></span> | <span class="t">More importantly, when you talk about real-world scenarios where you're implementing this, you're talking about scalability.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.600</a></span> | <span class="t">These are the pillars to think about when you're scaling them in the real world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll have Hari talk about the pillars of trust.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Hey, thanks, Sahil.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So, every mission-critical system that we rely on today, be it aircrafts, be it energy grids, or be it even the simple banking financial systems, are built on principles of safety and understanding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So, looking at the first pillar, our AI systems should be no different, so looking at the first pillar, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.880</a></span> | <span class="t">First, AI has to show its work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Every important decision shouldn't be a mystery.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.180</a></span> | <span class="t">It should come with a simple English explanation so that an end user, a decision maker, somebody who is auditing the system, is able to act on the information and not look for a data scientist to explain or translate what the system actually means.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the first pillar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.820</a></span> | <span class="t">The second pillar, adaptive control.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.520</a></span> | <span class="t">What do we mean by that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.560</a></span> | <span class="t">It's about building smart guardrains.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">If the AI system starts to wear off, makes a wrong decision, the system should be able to slow down, change its course, or at least call a human for help.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Think of it as a lane assist for your AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.220</a></span> | <span class="t">The third pillar is always have human in the loop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.400</a></span> | <span class="t">What do we mean by that?</span></div><div

so that the right experts get pinged in the right time with the right information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.260</a></span> | <span class="t">without causing an overhead for both the system as well as the person, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=328" target="_blank">00:05:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">But all of these things are built on the bedrock foundation of traceability.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=333" target="_blank">00:05:33.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Every data, every change

AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=355" target="_blank">00:05:55.060</a></span> | <span class="t">But with these pillars in place, the larger question is, how do we actually weave them into the AI systems we are building and running today?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=364" target="_blank">00:06:04.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=370" target="_blank">00:06:10.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So, like I said, how do we make these pillars reality in day-to-day AI operations?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.020</a></span> | <span class="t">This is where we move

together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=743" target="_blank">00:12:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to talk about a company called GuardHat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=746" target="_blank">00:12:26.460</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a company that I used to work for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=748" target="_blank">00:12:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">It's focused on worker safety.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=752" target="_blank">00:12:32.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So, more specifically, it has an AI-driven platform that is geared towards solving worker safety problems in hazardous environments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=761" target="_blank">00:12:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So, what we're doing here is we built IoT devices, wearable devices, that would be worn by the workers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=770" target="_blank">00:12:50.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, at some point in time, these devices would get deployed, activated, and they will collect data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=777" target="_blank">00:12:57.880</a></span> | <span class="t">They'll collect health data as well as environmental data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=783" target="_blank">00:13:03.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, that data is sent to the backend system where the AI analyzes this in real time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=790" target="_blank">00:13:10.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And based on that, it is able to identify when an incident, predict when an incident is about to happen, and, you know, you can prevent that incident from happening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=798" target="_blank">00:13:18.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So, very mission-critical application.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=802" target="_blank">00:13:22.260</a></span> | <span class="t">It was great because while we were saving lives in a way, there were enormous challenges.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=811" target="_blank">00:13:31.240</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the inputs to the AI platform was the GPS.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=815" target="_blank">00:13:35.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And as a result, 70% of the cases were false positives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=822" target="_blank">00:13:42.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's easier to say this now because it's after the fact, but back then, we didn't know that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=828" target="_blank">00:13:48.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, the behavior of the user was that at that point in time, the user stopped reacting to the alerts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=839" target="_blank">00:13:59.880</a></span> | <span class="t">They started ignoring the alerts, and that caused a huge safety risk, not just for the people, of course, their lives at stake, but even for the company, from the liability point of view, that workers were not reacting to alerts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=855" target="_blank">00:14:15.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we went back to the drawing board.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=858" target="_blank">00:14:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">We started identifying the issues.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=862" target="_blank">00:14:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, if we were to do this without the X-DOPs framework, we would probably do an MTTR, mean time to resolution.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=870" target="_blank">00:14:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">If you look at it, you know, 70% of the time is spent in identifying the problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=875" target="_blank">00:14:35.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Another 20% is spent in finding a solution, and then you deploy it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=880" target="_blank">00:14:40.580</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think the most critical part is that there is no system to identify the GPS drift.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=886" target="_blank">00:14:46.260</a></span> | <span class="t">We wouldn't know about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=887" target="_blank">00:14:47.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, because it's such a complicated model and code, that it's really hard to identify what's causing that problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=894" target="_blank">00:14:54.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So, if you were to apply this model, day zero, you get an alert that was ignored during an incident.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=904" target="_blank">00:15:04.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Day two, there is an attribution telemetry that will flag the anomaly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=910" target="_blank">00:15:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And day seven, you have a solution deployed, which fixes the GPS drift, or at least finds a reroute to the GPS drift.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=918" target="_blank">00:15:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, having said that, to be real, this problem did not get solved in seven days.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=927" target="_blank">00:15:27.420</a></span> | <span class="t">It took eight months for us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=929" target="_blank">00:15:29.060</a></span> | <span class="t">But this was a model problem that actually helped us to build this framework.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=933" target="_blank">00:15:33.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And once we were able to build this framework, these kind of problems can be solved in seven days.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=938" target="_blank">00:15:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">We tested it across our enterprise and eventually became an enterprise standard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=943" target="_blank">00:15:43.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So, all this is great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=945" target="_blank">00:15:45.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You have the impact.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=947" target="_blank">00:15:47.460</a></span> | <span class="t">You have, you can see the value in this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=951" target="_blank">00:15:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">But here's the big question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=952" target="_blank">00:15:52.940</a></span> | <span class="t">What do, how do you convince the CIOs?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=958" target="_blank">00:15:58.680</a></span> | <span class="t">How do they look at all of this and find value in this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=962" target="_blank">00:16:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">What is the language that they talk?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=964" target="_blank">00:16:04.180</a></span> | <span class="t">The answer is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=968" target="_blank">00:16:08.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you've got to convince the CIOs that this is saving money.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=972" target="_blank">00:16:12.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you were to look at the left side of the slide, you'll see that the risk exposure that we're looking at is approximately $2.5 million per site per year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=982" target="_blank">00:16:22.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, some direct impact with this is that we were able to solve the, with this product, or this structure, we were able to solve the fines.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=993" target="_blank">00:16:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And we saved $500,000 in fines every year per site.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=997" target="_blank">00:16:37.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Beyond this, some of the indirect benefit was that this system, if it were to be working correctly, was supposed to prevent incidents, all of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=1009" target="_blank">00:16:49.340</a></span> | <span class="t">But it was preventing X percentage of incidences because it wasn't working correctly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=1013" target="_blank">00:16:53.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But with this structure, it did work correctly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=1016" target="_blank">00:16:56.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And then after that, you got the remaining value as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=1022" target="_blank">00:17:02.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I just want to wrap it up real quick.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=1026" target="_blank">00:17:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the outcome, you can see a lot of value there in terms of, you know, false alerts came down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=1032" target="_blank">00:17:12.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Trust score went up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=1034" target="_blank">00:17:14.100</a></span> | <span class="t">That means people started using those alerts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=1037" target="_blank">00:17:17.080</a></span> | <span class="t">They were able to see value in those alerts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=1039" target="_blank">00:17:19.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I think more important things were related to the telemetry itself, understanding why a particular inference was made, having the control where you can, if there's a GPS drift, you were able to switch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=1053" target="_blank">00:17:33.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And then most important thing, human in the loop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=1056" target="_blank">00:17:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So, if these things happen, someone is notified.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=1059" target="_blank">00:17:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">We created a dashboard where someone is notified and someone is able to take action and retrain the model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=1066" target="_blank">00:17:46.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So, with that, I mean, this slide is just a high-level overview of what we presented to you today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=1077" target="_blank">00:17:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you for being here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=1079" target="_blank">00:17:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">We'll just leave it at that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=1081" target="_blank">00:18:01.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you so much for the fantastic talk on the trust gap.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=1088" target="_blank">00:18:08.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I actually had a question for you because we have a minute or so.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=1091" target="_blank">00:18:11.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So, the phrasing that you had around, like, the trust-adjusted risk cost premium, how do you advise people to think about, like, reputational damage?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=1100" target="_blank">00:18:20.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, is this something that you have thought about measuring or investigating at all?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=1105" target="_blank">00:18:25.220</a></span> | <span class="t">You want to take it short?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=1107" target="_blank">00:18:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it's, like I was saying in the beginning, these are silent failures.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=1112" target="_blank">00:18:32.460</a></span> | <span class="t">You cannot, it's really hard to quantify the impact.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=1116" target="_blank">00:18:36.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And reputational damage is, again, right on top of that list.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=1119" target="_blank">00:18:39.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it's really hard to measure that, to be honest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=1123" target="_blank">00:18:43.540</a></span> | <span class="t">But all you can do in this kind of a case is, you know, you can find, you know, people are creative.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=1130" target="_blank">00:18:50.020</a></span> | <span class="t">You can find ways to quantify some dollars to it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=1132" target="_blank">00:18:52.520</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, it's really hard to predict.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=1135" target="_blank">00:18:55.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, there's no short answer to it, let me just say that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tpm4m1YxHk&t=1137" target="_blank">00:18:57.780</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, there's no short answer to it, let me just say that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
