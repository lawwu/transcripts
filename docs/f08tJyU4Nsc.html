I was at a conference recently where my assignment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f08tJyU4Nsc&t=392" target="_blank">00:06:32.700</a></span> | <span class="t">was from the leaders, "Talk to us for 20 minutes about what you would do if you were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f08tJyU4Nsc&t=399" target="_blank">00:06:39.380</a></span> | <span class="t">22 again."
