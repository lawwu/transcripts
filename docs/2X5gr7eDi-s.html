I had never heard of jackfruit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X5gr7eDi-s&t=2181" target="_blank">00:36:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">my whole life.

Well, sometimes the simplest one is food. For my birthday last</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X5gr7eDi-s&t=2206" target="_blank">00:36:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">year, my wife took me to a Korean restaurant way out in probably an hour from here.

And so when we go to places, the gifts I try to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X5gr7eDi-s&t=2252" target="_blank">00:37:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">bring people, I'm like, "Oh, let's bring some smoked paprika from Croatia." I can't remember</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X5gr7eDi-s&t=2258" target="_blank">00:37:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">what country, Budapest, Hungary.

The things we bring people are things to help them experience something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X5gr7eDi-s&t=2273" target="_blank">00:37:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of satiating, like a drink, an alcohol, a spirit, a spice. I don't know. That's one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X5gr7eDi-s&t=2281" target="_blank">00:38:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I remember, I can't remember where I was that I experienced raclette and we bought a raclette</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X5gr7eDi-s&t=2287" target="_blank">00:38:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">grill.

And ideally, talking to people about it. I think the experiences that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X5gr7eDi-s&t=2323" target="_blank">00:38:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">have happened once we've come home are always being able to connect the dots in strange ways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X5gr7eDi-s&t=2330" target="_blank">00:38:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So a great example was we were in the park, just a five-minute walk from our house the other day,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X5gr7eDi-s&t=2335" target="_blank">00:38:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and all these people are dancing. And I was like, "Why is everybody dancing?" This is not a park</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X5gr7eDi-s&t=2340" target="_blank">00:39:00.160</a></span> | <span class="t">where there's normally dancing, but there's a bunch of kids and adults all dancing and eating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X5gr7eDi-s&t=2344" target="_blank">00:39:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And I asked them, I said, "What's going on?" And they're like, "Oh, we're celebrating because it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X5gr7eDi-s&t=2348" target="_blank">00:39:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">was the Lebanese festival last weekend, and all these kids danced in a parade. And so now we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X5gr7eDi-s&t=2352" target="_blank">00:39:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of celebrating here."

And it's funny because I think many Americans would be terrified if a random person in a park</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X5gr7eDi-s&t=2364" target="_blank">00:39:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">starts picking up and dancing with your kid. But we're like, "Oh, I've been to Lebanon." And the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X5gr7eDi-s&t=2368" target="_blank">00:39:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">culture is just so welcoming. We ended up spending two hours there having meals, talking about our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X5gr7eDi-s&t=2373" target="_blank">00:39:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">trip to Lebanon, and having a way to connect with people. And I think it turns out we live half a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X5gr7eDi-s&t=2380" target="_blank">00:39:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">mile from a Lebanese church.

And so I think one cool thing to take away, and depending where in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X5gr7eDi-s&t=2402" target="_blank">00:40:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the country you are, it could be harder or easier, but you don't have to go halfway around the world</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X5gr7eDi-s&t=2406" target="_blank">00:40:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to have a really immersive cultural experience that's far different from where you are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X5gr7eDi-s&t=2410" target="_blank">00:40:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I think we try to have those experiences when we're traveling, but we also try to have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X5gr7eDi-s&t=2414" target="_blank">00:40:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">those experiences here and find the pockets of a city that are lots of Korean restaurants or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X5gr7eDi-s&t=2422" target="_blank">00:40:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">lots of people doing XYZ and try to do that while we're here.

And with two small kids, it's hard. But it's not hard to necessarily go to a local</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X5gr7eDi-s&t=2433" target="_blank">00:40:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Korean restaurant or meet a bunch of Lebanese people dancing in the park.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X5gr7eDi-s&t=2437" target="_blank">00:40:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">That's awesome.

I have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X5gr7eDi-s&t=2446" target="_blank">00:40:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">lot of old traveler friends who, they get married and they start to have kids and they're worried</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X5gr7eDi-s&t=2450" target="_blank">00:40:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that it's going to cut into their travel experience.
