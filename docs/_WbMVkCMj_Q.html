last words, "Grace reigns."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WbMVkCMj_Q&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I thought, Packer has just walked through that river with a flag flying over his head.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WbMVkCMj_Q&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Grace reigns.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WbMVkCMj_Q&t=302"

target="_blank">00:05:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reason it seems appropriate to say this at the beginning of our conversation here is that Ryle, Bishop Ryle was precious to Packer because he represented latter day Puritans.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WbMVkCMj_Q&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I don't know of another person that Packer took the time, maybe Richard Baxter would be that person, but another person that he devoted an entire book.</span></div><div

Faithfulness and Holiness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WbMVkCMj_Q&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the other half is Ryle's book on holiness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WbMVkCMj_Q&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.000</a></span> | <span

class="t">And the reason he did gets at the key to who he was and why he made an impact on me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WbMVkCMj_Q&t=355" target="_blank">00:05:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He said that, and this is in his book on Ryle and then in his book called Quest for Godliness, which is one I'd recommend for everybody besides his classic Knowing God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WbMVkCMj_Q&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He said that the Puritans and Ryle included as a latter day Puritan were the very best kind of Christian that has ever existed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WbMVkCMj_Q&t=383" target="_blank">00:06:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, that's incredible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WbMVkCMj_Q&t=385" target="_blank">00:06:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, let me just, I mean, not everybody knows what I mean when I say Puritans.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WbMVkCMj_Q&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He mentioned Richard Baxter, John Owen, Richard Sibbes, John Flavel, Thomas Brooks, Thomas Manton, Thomas Watson, Robert Trail, William Bridge, Thomas Goodwin, Stephen Charnock, Jeremiah Burroughs, John Bunyan, William Gurnall.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WbMVkCMj_Q&t=405" target="_blank">00:06:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's 16th and 17th century band of brothers who loved the sovereignty of God, were thoroughly reformed in their theology, and yet were the most pastoral, penetrating, personal, effective, prayerful, pious kind of people there were.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WbMVkCMj_Q&t=425" target="_blank">00:07:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so he actually says, this is a quote, "This type was in Ryle's view, as in mine, the best type of evangelical that the world has seen."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WbMVkCMj_Q&t=441" target="_blank">00:07:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that meant quite simply, the best type of Christian, close quote.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WbMVkCMj_Q&t=446" target="_blank">00:07:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, just think of what he's saying.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WbMVkCMj_Q&t=449" target="_blank">00:07:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He thinks that band of brothers is the quintessential appearance on earth after Jesus of the best kind of Christians.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WbMVkCMj_Q&t=460" target="_blank">00:07:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He called them the Redwoods.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WbMVkCMj_Q&t=462"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WbMVkCMj_Q&t=1191" target="_blank">00:19:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I had looked at history, and I looked at what was happening around the world,

<span class="t">And the question I was raising to myself was, "Why does God bless all over the world?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WbMVkCMj_Q&t=1209" target="_blank">00:20:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He seems to bless, that is, use people to save sinners whose theology is defective."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WbMVkCMj_Q&t=1218" target="_blank">00:20:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And in his book, "Keep in Step with the Spirit," Packer has this great quote that ever since then has been a real sweet, humbling help to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WbMVkCMj_Q&t=1232" target="_blank">00:20:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He said, "God loves to bless the needle of truth in a haystack of error."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WbMVkCMj_Q&t=1240" target="_blank">00:20:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's not a slight, because Richard Baxter was probably as close as anybody to a hero for Packer, largely because Baxter's pastoral orientation on life made Packer a pastor as well as a theologian.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WbMVkCMj_Q&t=1265" target="_blank">00:21:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And he says, "Theologically, he was something of a disaster."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WbMVkCMj_Q&t=1271" target="_blank">00:21:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">[laughter]</span></div><div

graciousness to find usefulness, riches in Baxter, and he could just take the disaster on certain points and set it aside and benefit from what he saw.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WbMVkCMj_Q&t=1302" target="_blank">00:21:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that was a great help to me, and it's been a great inspiration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WbMVkCMj_Q&t=1307" target="_blank">00:21:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I keep learning things from Packer everywhere I turn in his—</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WbMVkCMj_Q&t=1314" target="_blank">00:21:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I suppose the reason for that, as you would know as well as I do, is because under it all was his absolute allegiance to and love for an inerrant Bible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WbMVkCMj_Q&t=1328" target="_blank">00:22:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He was part of the battle for the Bible in the '70s, and the capstone of his career, I've heard him say, was his leadership or editorship of the new translation called the English Standard Version, the ESV.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WbMVkCMj_Q&t=1349" target="_blank">00:22:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we would be amiss not to pay tribute to Packer's deep, solid, heartfelt devotion to the infallibility and truthfulness and authority and pervasive usefulness of the Bible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WbMVkCMj_Q&t=1368" target="_blank">00:22:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what's going to make Packer durable for decades, perhaps centuries to
