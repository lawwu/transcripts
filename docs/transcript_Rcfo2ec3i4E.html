If someone else signs up, they get $100. But if you sign up, get $100, and then you refer, let's say, your spouse, they get $100, but you also get $100 for signing them up.</p><p>So now it becomes $300 instead of just your $100. And that's how you can scale things quite a bit. It could be also just like your cousin or your friend that you're, like, you know, been friends with for a decade. There's so many ways to acquire a Player 2 or Player 3 or Player 4.</p><p>There's some people that I chat with that have 10 plus players. And for them, it really is a full-scale business where they're managing multiple players, doing multiple bank bonuses, all these bonuses. Because if you imagine I'm just making $36,000 between me and my P2, if you had 10 players, that's over $150,000.</p><p>And maybe you were working on this 40 hours a week instead of just 10 or 15.</p></div></div></body></html>
