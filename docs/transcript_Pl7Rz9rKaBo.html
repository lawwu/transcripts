On my off time, the learning that I performed by my own incentive, that's what stuck with me. That's what feels like it lasted.</p><p>I'm like, "Shit. If that's the case, I should just let my kids learn what the fuck they want and just enable them. Put interesting things around them. Give them a project. If you want to do this project, you're going to have to learn these skills in order to do it." I read a huge amount, which I think led to me being a good writer today.</p><p>I just read books about things. I don't know. In terms of juggling, a lot of physical comedy stuff. I did some movies, some short movies.</p></div></div></body></html>
