I sort of have a two-factor model of economic growth, which is it's about education, and it's about having governments that are pro-business. The U.S. has historically been better on being pro-business than, let's say, the northern European social democracies, but the northern European social democracies are great on the education front.</p><p>Within the U.S., you also have this balance, whereas places like Massachusetts and California are certainly much less pro-business, but they're pretty well educated. But the sort of real secret sauce is finding those places that are both highly educated and pro-business. So those are places like Charlotte and Austin and even Atlanta, places in the sunbelt that have attracted lots of skilled people, and they've done very, very well during COVID.</p><p>I mean, Austin, by most dimensions, is the superstar of the COVID era in terms of just attracting people. So I think you had to wait for the real estate prices to come down a bit in in Austin, but those are the places that I would be looking at.</p></div></div></body></html>
