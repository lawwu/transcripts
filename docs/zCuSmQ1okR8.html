So that's number one. Delighting in God practically means</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCuSmQ1okR8&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">seeing and savoring the diverse excellencies of God, especially as they are manifest in Christ,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCuSmQ1okR8&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">especially as he brings them to fulfillment at the cross. But here's the second thing I'd say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCuSmQ1okR8&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and I think I only have two more.

I have often said in many contexts, no one goes to the Grand Canyon</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCuSmQ1okR8&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to increase his self-esteem. We go to the Grand Canyon. Why? People do. They go to the Grand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCuSmQ1okR8&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Canyon.

Because standing at a Grand Canyon and watching this vast, cavernous,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCuSmQ1okR8&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">open space that goes down a mile into the ground with a tiny little river down there at the bottom,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCuSmQ1okR8&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">which is a massive river, it does something to our souls because God made us to know him as the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCuSmQ1okR8&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">great Grand Canyon. Tony, what happened when I've told that? A woman said to me one time that was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCuSmQ1okR8&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">so illuminating to me. She said, "Well, yes, but it's hard to enjoy the Grand Canyon if you feel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCuSmQ1okR8&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">you might fall over the edge and be killed by the Grand Canyon." I thought, "That's right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCuSmQ1okR8&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">She's absolutely right. If we don't have, in addition to seeing and savoring the Grand Canyon,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCuSmQ1okR8&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">a sweet sense that the Canyon's not going to kill us..." I'll shift my metaphor off the Canyon</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCuSmQ1okR8&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">onto Jesus.

We'll just be terrified.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCuSmQ1okR8&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We will be locked up inside our fears and we won't be able to know him and enjoy him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCuSmQ1okR8&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">From the time I was a sophomore in college, Galatians 2.20 has served me like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCuSmQ1okR8&t=402" target="_blank">00:06:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I am crucified with Christ.

In the life that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCuSmQ1okR8&t=407" target="_blank">00:06:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I now live, in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God. Then I pause, I take a deep breath,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCuSmQ1okR8&t=413" target="_blank">00:06:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">"Who loved me, who loved me." It's one of the few places where Paul uses the singular personal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCuSmQ1okR8&t=422" target="_blank">00:07:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">pronoun for how Jesus relates to him and not just us. "He loved me and gave himself for me." That's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCuSmQ1okR8&t=430" target="_blank">00:07:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">what Paul said. So I just transfer that over onto me. And just recently, Tony, in my devotions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCuSmQ1okR8&t=435" target="_blank">00:07:15.600</a></span> | <span class="t">just I think maybe two days ago it was, I read in Revelation 2. No, it was more than two days ago</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCuSmQ1okR8&t=440" target="_blank">00:07:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">because I'm at Revelation 11 now. So it was nine days ago. I read chapter 2 verse 17 where Jesus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCuSmQ1okR8&t=449" target="_blank">00:07:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">says, "I will give him," so I'm reading John Piper. He says, "John, I will give you a white stone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCuSmQ1okR8&t=458" target="_blank">00:07:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">someday with a new name written on it that no one knows except the one who receives it." Why does he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCuSmQ1okR8&t=466" target="_blank">00:07:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">say that, Tony? Why does he say that? He says it because he wants to assure me you're not a number</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCuSmQ1okR8&t=476" target="_blank">00:07:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">in the system.

I have a name</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCuSmQ1okR8&t=484" target="_blank">00:08:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">for you, and I want you and me to have the kind of relationship that there are things about it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCuSmQ1okR8&t=490" target="_blank">00:08:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">nobody else knows. That is simply breathtaking. So my second thing for Tandy is to say that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCuSmQ1okR8&t=499" target="_blank">00:08:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">delighting in God means delighting in his love for me and delighting in the fact that he cares</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCuSmQ1okR8&t=506" target="_blank">00:08:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">for me and will protect me and means to have that kind of intimate personal relationship with me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCuSmQ1okR8&t=511" target="_blank">00:08:31.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And I suppose I shouldn't stop without saying we delight in God through what he's made.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCuSmQ1okR8&t=520" target="_blank">00:08:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">The heavens are telling the glory of God, and we did a podcast about food and sex and said they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCuSmQ1okR8&t=527" target="_blank">00:08:47.120</a></span> | <span class="t">really God's gifts, and we're supposed to receive them with thanksgiving and turn them into an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCuSmQ1okR8&t=532" target="_blank">00:08:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">occasion of worship.

So let me say those three again. Seeing and savoring him is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCuSmQ1okR8&t=547" target="_blank">00:09:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">infinitely admirable.
