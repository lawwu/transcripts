What do I got next? All right. Next question is from Jay. How do you choose what book to read next? Good question, Jay. There's two main ways that books come onto my radar of things I need to read. It's either functional. So I need it for research.</p><p>Maybe I'm working on an article or I'm working on a book chapter and I need to read something because I need to know that information. So there's functional ways that things come onto my list of things to read. Everything else is inspirational. That looks interesting. Let's get that and read that as soon as possible after I get it.</p><p>So it's sort of like spontaneous or functional or inspirational and functional. So I just looked here. I have four books I bought. I bought four books in the last week. So I thought I would just go through those and I'll for each let you know what the motivation was.</p><p>These are four books that hopefully I'll probably read these all within the next three or four weeks. That'd be the idea. So I bought First Man by James Hansen. So James, it's a biography of Neil Armstrong. It's because I was watching Damon Chazelle's movie First Man, which by the way is underrated.</p><p>I think it's a fantastic movie, especially if you can watch it on a good screen with a good sound system. I don't want to geek out about his use of 16 millimeter film and the cockpits. And there's like a lot of really interesting decisions he makes. It's Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy from The Crown, whatever.</p><p>So I was watching this movie, which is great. And I want to write, I want to read the book it's based off of. So that was just inspiration. Yeah, let's do this. Karen Armstrong's new book, Sacred Nature. I love Karen Armstrong's work. I talked about the case for God and the history of God a lot on this podcast.</p><p>He has a new book out about the ways that people have found sacredness and nature throughout history. I mean, of course I'm on board for that type of thing. I saw that just mentioned in the New Yorkers roundup of the best books of the year so far. Boom, just ordered that short book.</p><p>You know, I'll read it in a few days. Very excited for that. I also bought Super Intelligence by Nick Bostrom. This is an AI ethics type book. It's for an article, right? So that's more like homework. I'm reading a chapter every morning of that. And then there's 15 chapters.</p><p>I'm reading a chapter every morning as a baseline. And then I'm going to throw in here and there extra sessions to read a couple more chapters here and there. So I can get it done within 10 days would be nice. And then I also just bought right before I came here, John Meacham's new Lincoln biography.</p><p>I am a big, I'm a Lincoln fan. I read a lot of Lincoln stuff, but I'm particularly excited about Meacham's new biography for a lot of reasons. I read a great review of it in the Washington Post book world this weekend. And so that's on its way. It's a big book.</p><p>I'll find time to read it. I want to get that done in November if I can as well. So there you go. It's a mix of inspiration and functionality. And if I get inspired, I buy it. I want to get into that book before the inspiration dies down. When you're reading enough, you can get through a lot of books.</p><p>So on a given month, how many books do you read or how many books do you buy? Sorry. I mean, five. So last week you bought a lot of your quota. Yeah. I have all I need for the next month, but sometimes I buy in books. I'm not going to read the whole thing, but I need like this chapter and that chapter for an article or book research, like that's worth 25 bucks to me.</p><p>Yeah. If I can get a good example out of something, but yeah, I bought a lot of my quota in a big burst. And then you take trips to the library too every once in a while too, right? Yeah. And we have Little Free Libraries in my town. They're really big.</p><p>My town is really big on these Little Free Libraries are everywhere. And I get a lot of good books out of those. It's just a take a book, leave a book type system. Are those on the side of the road? Yeah. Okay. I've seen them. Have you seen them to like, they look like mailboxes.</p><p>Yeah. I walked by one. Yeah. You can, I mean, this is like Willy Wonka's factory for me, for my personality is this town. It's like, just wander around and just pick up free books from these like well-educated peoples, like their professors, Little Free Libraries, and just walk around and just like pick up free books.</p><p>So when you're done picking up free books, go to like one of our mini coffee shops to just sort of like sit and drink coffee and read. And it's a cool town. It's a good, it's a good match for me. Though I should stop promoting it because we don't want too many more people to move here.</p><p>It's getting expensive. So yeah. Do not move here. Helps your house value though. It does help the house value. There's a cool town. It's quaint. It has a lot of books and good coffee shops. That's all good. Infested with werewolves. So just, you know, caveat emptier, otherwise great. Good books, good coffee.</p><p>You may have your flesh be devoured by a lichen trope, so you just got to balance that out.</p></div></div></body></html>
