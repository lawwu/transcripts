It often isn't the last place I look. Again, I still think of something like a broad search engine like chat GPT or perplexity as the starting point. In some cases it helps me understand things, right?</p><p>So they'll like explain it to me like I'm five or sometimes in a character like that's helpful as well. One thing that I think is underrated for many of these LLMs is the ability to take really messy information, whether it's your notes, whether it's a spreadsheet that you haven't perfectly set up and just clean it up for you.</p><p>So again, I think it's like really good for that base layer, at least the broad LLMs. But again, I think that where the LLMs get really interesting are when they're more curated or people have used the APIs for more curated action. I think it's actually depending on what you're looking to do a lot more helpful than the broad based LLMs.</p></div></div></body></html>
