But just having a number alone does not do it. I know a lot of millionaires,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=97" target="_blank">00:01:37.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I speak to them on my podcast sometimes, and they are wracked with anxiety and guilt and worry.

How would you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=114" target="_blank">00:01:54.300</a></span> | <span class="t">define living a rich life?

But your rich life is yours. So each person listening to this is probably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.780</a></span> | <span class="t">going to have something very different. I'll just give you some specifics from my own rich life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Every time I eat out, I have created a rule for myself. I want to be able to order appetizers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">because as a kid, I couldn't, we couldn't afford it. And if I'm eating out with coworkers or something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">like that, I'm always saying, whatever you see on the menu, order it.

You see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.780</a></span> | <span class="t">three things you like, get them all because that was totally abundant to me as a kid.

So that's like a smaller part of my rich life is like the 10 or $15 appetizer. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">there's the big stuff.

It's flying business class</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.620</a></span> | <span class="t">on any flight over four hours. It's those kinds of things that are meaningful to me, which might be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.340</a></span> | <span class="t">very different for somebody else. For someone who hasn't gone through any exercise to even think about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.860</a></span> | <span class="t">that, how do you encourage them to figure out what their rich life would look like?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I always like to ask people what they love to spend money on. I just love it because like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.760</a></span> | <span class="t">look at your face right now.

And that's what I call a money dial. It's something you can turn up or turn down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.040</a></span> | <span class="t">We have eating out or food is a big one.

Those four key numbers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.180</a></span> | <span class="t">you need to know them like the back of your hand.

That's a waste of time as well. I have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=382" target="_blank">00:06:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">no financial apps on my phone.

In other words, you need to focus on the big wins in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=393" target="_blank">00:06:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">life. And if you get those right, then the price of a Topo Chico does not affect you in any way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=399" target="_blank">00:06:39.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So fixed costs seems maybe the most straightforward. Is that fair? You could look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.820</a></span> | <span class="t">at the things you spend money on, and they're probably big ticket things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll go through them quickly. So the first category, fixed costs, that number ideally should</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.540</a></span> | <span class="t">be 50 to 60% of your take-home pay. That's after tax. So in fixed costs would be your rent or mortgage,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=417" target="_blank">00:06:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">your utilities, groceries, car payment, debt payments, all the stuff you need to keep the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.900</a></span> | <span class="t">lights on every month. The stuff that even if one of you got laid off, you would still pay it. Childcare.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=429" target="_blank">00:07:09.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Those are all fixed costs. The next one is savings. This is like money for an emergency fund,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=436" target="_blank">00:07:16.500</a></span> | <span class="t">or even a trip you're going to take two years from now. 5 to 10% is a good range. Obviously,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=442" target="_blank">00:07:22.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the more the better. Great. Once you hit your emergency fund, you could probably cut that number</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=447" target="_blank">00:07:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">down a bit. Investments. This is where the real wealth is created. 5 to 10% of take-home pay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=453" target="_blank">00:07:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">although the more the better, and I really mean that. It's a little ironic that we spend our entire</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=457" target="_blank">00:07:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">life trying to find a discount at Taco Bell. Meanwhile, we don't spend any time talking about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=462" target="_blank">00:07:42.280</a></span> | <span class="t">this one number, which literally can be worth millions of dollars. Changing that number by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=468" target="_blank">00:07:48.620</a></span> | <span class="t">1% can be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars over your lifetime. So this category is really,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=474" target="_blank">00:07:54.180</a></span> | <span class="t">really important. And then finally, guilt-free spending. This is like eating out, drinks, travel,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=480" target="_blank">00:08:00.300</a></span> | <span class="t">nice bag, whatever you want. 20 to 35% of take-home pay. That's kind of a lot of money. When you think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=487" target="_blank">00:08:07.260</a></span> | <span class="t">about it, you go, wait a second, I can spend 20 to 35% on clothes, eating out, hair, friends, all that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=493" target="_blank">00:08:13.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.

The problem with being an optimizer is that it can actually serve</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=574" target="_blank">00:09:34.220</a></span> | <span class="t">you really well.

The problem is that if you take it to its logical extreme, optimizers become unbearably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=588" target="_blank">00:09:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">boring and unbearably cheap.

But if we actually take the money and invest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=601" target="_blank">00:10:01.020</a></span> | <span class="t">it for the next 45 years, that $12 will actually turn into a $1,664.

Us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=728" target="_blank">00:12:08.600</a></span> | <span class="t">going to like, you know, six of us to a movie, never going to happen too much money.

And I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=745" target="_blank">00:12:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that really taught me that you can sharpen the edge on what's important for you. You can actually be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=749" target="_blank">00:12:29.800</a></span> | <span class="t">incredibly resourceful if you need money or you want to spend money on certain things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=754" target="_blank">00:12:34.900</a></span> | <span class="t">But then for other things, like I think about all the things we did not do as a kid for financial</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=760" target="_blank">00:12:40.500</a></span> | <span class="t">reasons.

We have to reframe the entire way we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1066" target="_blank">00:17:46.500</a></span> | <span class="t">think about spending money.

She goes, put that away. I said, what? Because in my family, we look at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1075" target="_blank">00:17:55.620</a></span> | <span class="t">price first.

And then we'll look at the price.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1082" target="_blank">00:18:02.180</a></span> | <span class="t">It blew my mind.

And I think part of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1232" target="_blank">00:20:32.740</a></span> | <span class="t">reason is it's very hard to compare. And you didn't say this strategy, but I pulled it out,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1238" target="_blank">00:20:38.260</a></span> | <span class="t">which is trying to just highlight the difference between two things. So if I'm at a grocery store</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1243" target="_blank">00:20:43.620</a></span> | <span class="t">and I'm like trying to buy something, I'm like, "Gosh, I know this thing is a lot cheaper somewhere</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1247" target="_blank">00:20:47.140</a></span> | <span class="t">else." And I'm using a small example because it's probably both relatable to some people and something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1252" target="_blank">00:20:52.660</a></span> | <span class="t">that still gets me at times. It's like, "Well, this thing is not just more expensive, but it's here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1258" target="_blank">00:20:58.740</a></span> | <span class="t">It's in front of me now. It's not a drive away. It's convenient. I've already got things in my bag</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1263" target="_blank">00:21:03.380</a></span> | <span class="t">and just trying to process all the things that are kind of like bonuses you get, even if it's more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1268" target="_blank">00:21:08.180</a></span> | <span class="t">expensive." Now, I know that's probably a little cost first, but it's looking at a thing and thinking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1272" target="_blank">00:21:12.100</a></span> | <span class="t">about everything around it actually might help me a little bit in some of these scenarios.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1277" target="_blank">00:21:17.060</a></span> | <span class="t">But we've recently gotten better on vacations and taken, "Okay, well, we really want to go to this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1283" target="_blank">00:21:23.220</a></span> | <span class="t">thing. We want to have this experience. And the only way to have it is at the Four Seasons. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1287" target="_blank">00:21:27.540</a></span> | <span class="t">we're just going to pay for it." Let's go through this because I want to understand it. First, can you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1291" target="_blank">00:21:31.460</a></span> | <span class="t">just describe what you used to do? And then let's talk about what you do now. I'm curious.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1295" target="_blank">00:21:35.860</a></span> | <span class="t">We used to go say, "Okay, well, what kind of a trip do we want?" And I think we would start with the high</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1300" target="_blank">00:21:40.420</a></span> | <span class="t">level of, "We want to go to a beach." And then it might be, "Okay, is there a place that we can go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1306" target="_blank">00:21:46.500</a></span> | <span class="t">using points to make the trip a decent amount lower that would meet those criteria? Is there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1312" target="_blank">00:21:52.180</a></span> | <span class="t">something that matches it?" And hopefully there is. In this particular case, it was, "Gosh, I want this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1318" target="_blank">00:21:58.820</a></span> | <span class="t">trip." And for anyone who doesn't know the Four Seasons, there's no points option. There's no special</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1324" target="_blank">00:22:04.020</a></span> | <span class="t">deal. Like there might be some promotions. And I did an episode about why I actually thought it wasn't as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1328" target="_blank">00:22:08.740</a></span> | <span class="t">expensive as I thought, but I only found that out after the fact. And we were like, "This is just a thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1333" target="_blank">00:22:13.220</a></span> | <span class="t">we're going to make happen. We're going to spend what it takes to do this trip that we want."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1337" target="_blank">00:22:17.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Because we decided that that's the thing we wanted to do. Now, would we have been able to do it if it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1341" target="_blank">00:22:21.940</a></span> | <span class="t">were five times as expensive? Probably not. But it was certainly two or three times the price of other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1348" target="_blank">00:22:28.500</a></span> | <span class="t">hotels in Hawaii. I know you're not a big budgeting fan, but one of the things that really helped, and in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1355" target="_blank">00:22:35.140</a></span> | <span class="t">a way it's kind of the same as the four numbers you have, is I know that currently our income allows us to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1362" target="_blank">00:22:42.900</a></span> | <span class="t">save enough money that we are saving enough. I probably don't know the numbers as well as you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1367" target="_blank">00:22:47.780</a></span> | <span class="t">do. I know my spending amount and I know my take home amount and my saving amount. I haven't really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1372" target="_blank">00:22:52.500</a></span> | <span class="t">thought about the rest, but I just knew that if we spent this money, it's not going to derail anything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1376" target="_blank">00:22:56.740</a></span> | <span class="t">We've done a pretty good job of running through. Here's where we spend money. If we were going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1380" target="_blank">00:23:00.900</a></span> | <span class="t">spend a little more, where would we want to spend it? And in this case, that was how we wanted to do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1385" target="_blank">00:23:05.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And it wasn't hard. Like it was weird that it was easier to spend thousands of dollars more on a vacation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1391" target="_blank">00:23:11.460</a></span> | <span class="t">than we normally would. Yet it's probably still difficult to spend</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1395" target="_blank">00:23:15.700</a></span> | <span class="t">40 extra dollars to rent an SUV on a trip we're taking right now. Like I'm actually booking a rental</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1402" target="_blank">00:23:22.020</a></span> | <span class="t">car. And for some reason that I can't explain, I'm like, "God, do I really want to spend the $40 to have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1407" target="_blank">00:23:27.860</a></span> | <span class="t">the four-wheel drive car?" We're going to Costa Rica during the rainy season. Like it seems like a smart</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1412" target="_blank">00:23:32.820</a></span> | <span class="t">decision. But that decision is actually harder for me than spending thousands of dollars on a vacation. I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1419" target="_blank">00:23:39.220</a></span> | <span class="t">part of it is it's one of those things that usually doesn't always matter. It's like insurance. The</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1425" target="_blank">00:23:45.460</a></span> | <span class="t">other day I bought insurance to ship a package and then guess what? The package got there. You could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1429" target="_blank">00:23:49.140</a></span> | <span class="t">say it was a waste of money, but I had the peace of mind going into it. In this case, I'm like, "Do we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1433" target="_blank">00:23:53.380</a></span> | <span class="t">really need that?" It's like every time we go visit family in Colorado, it's like, "Well, we probably should</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1437" target="_blank">00:23:57.540</a></span> | <span class="t">get the four-wheel drive car and 99% of the time it's not snowing and icing and we didn't need it."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1442" target="_blank">00:24:02.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, there's a lot of things we don't need. I think that when I talk to people who are optimizers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1448" target="_blank">00:24:08.900</a></span> | <span class="t">reformed optimizers, there's always a sense of control that's trying to be exerted. And I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1453" target="_blank">00:24:13.940</a></span> | <span class="t">that sometimes we can find more control in playing small than in playing big. So for example, I spoke to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1462" target="_blank">00:24:22.020</a></span> | <span class="t">a couple on my podcast. They were in severe debt. They presented it as having $313,000 of debt. I ran</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1469" target="_blank">00:24:29.380</a></span> | <span class="t">their numbers. They actually have $350,000, $3,000 of debt. So they were under by like 40 grand. They</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1473" target="_blank">00:24:33.940</a></span> | <span class="t">didn't even know. And she spends three hours a day. That's not an exaggeration. Three hours a day</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1480" target="_blank">00:24:40.740</a></span> | <span class="t">on a spreadsheet looking through their numbers. And I looked at the spreadsheet and it was incredibly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1486" target="_blank">00:24:46.180</a></span> | <span class="t">confusing. All red. Everything was red and just depressing to look at. I said, "Do you like this?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1493" target="_blank">00:24:53.220</a></span> | <span class="t">She goes, "No, I don't like it." Well, she spent her time there every day, over 20 hours a week,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1499" target="_blank">00:24:59.540</a></span> | <span class="t">because it gives her a sense of control. Once in a while, I find myself looking for a purchase,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1503" target="_blank">00:25:03.940</a></span> | <span class="t">like a $20 item on Amazon. And I've got five tabs open. I'm reading the freaking Wirecutter reviews.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1509" target="_blank">00:25:09.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm like, "Oh my God, I got pulled into this." A couple of reasons. One, the world makes it easy for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1515" target="_blank">00:25:15.300</a></span> | <span class="t">us to cross compare information. But two, if you're an optimizer, if you're especially good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1520" target="_blank">00:25:20.820</a></span> | <span class="t">at crunching numbers and comparing things, you're just drawn to that. The solution is not to beat</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1527" target="_blank">00:25:27.540</a></span> | <span class="t">yourself up. It's actually just to create a rule. That's it. It's just to say a worry-free number.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1532" target="_blank">00:25:32.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And you say in your family, "Any number below this, we're just not going to worry about it. I'm just going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1538" target="_blank">00:25:38.180</a></span> | <span class="t">to buy the best, or I'm going to buy the middle." Whatever the rule is for you. For a lot of people,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1542" target="_blank">00:25:42.500</a></span> | <span class="t">the easiest place to start is just $20. Anything below $20, we're just not going to worry about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1548" target="_blank">00:25:48.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay? And it could be, "Should we get this thing of fruit? Should we get this? Should we get that?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1552" target="_blank">00:25:52.580</a></span> | <span class="t">20 bucks, not going to think twice, going to get it. Now, the first question people come back to me with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1557" target="_blank">00:25:57.460</a></span> | <span class="t">is, "Oh, Ramit, so you're saying I can spend 20 bucks 10 times a day, times 30? It's going to bankrupt</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1562" target="_blank">00:26:02.420</a></span> | <span class="t">us." Funny, again, that that's what people immediately jump to, as if they're going to go from frugalistas to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1568" target="_blank">00:26:08.820</a></span> | <span class="t">suddenly spending $6,000 a month on fruit. It's never going to happen. What they really are saying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1574" target="_blank">00:26:14.740</a></span> | <span class="t">is, "I don't trust myself to give myself that freedom of a $20 worry-free number." Trust me,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1581" target="_blank">00:26:21.940</a></span> | <span class="t">if you spend too much, you would catch it, and you would dial it back. We're going to do a worry-free</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1587" target="_blank">00:26:27.540</a></span> | <span class="t">number. We're going to feel good about money. You might have your own core values in your family,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1591" target="_blank">00:26:31.540</a></span> | <span class="t">like personal safety. That's number one for my family. And for a lot of parents, I think that's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1596" target="_blank">00:26:36.900</a></span> | <span class="t">great value. That means if we're booking two hotels, and one looks to be safer, and the other's in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1600" target="_blank">00:26:40.820</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe a dangerous part of the state, we're not going to do that. If we're booking a certain car,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1604" target="_blank">00:26:44.260</a></span> | <span class="t">and one is safer because there's muddy roads, we're going to get the thing, and that's it. And if it means</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1608" target="_blank">00:26:48.900</a></span> | <span class="t">that we have to stay one last day, that's what we're going to do, because that's our core value:</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1613" target="_blank">00:26:53.300</a></span> | <span class="t">family safety first, right? These are kinds of ways that you can actually become more fluid about it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1618" target="_blank">00:26:58.580</a></span> | <span class="t">versus finding yourself cost comparing on $20 or $40. I don't know if you would consider this a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1624" target="_blank">00:27:04.020</a></span> | <span class="t">healthy habit or not, but we had a challenge that every time we looked at flights, and almost everyone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1629" target="_blank">00:27:09.460</a></span> | <span class="t">probably can sympathize with this, the inconvenient flight is so cheap. It's like, "Oh, do you want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1635" target="_blank">00:27:15.460</a></span> | <span class="t">go to the airport at 5 a.m. and change planes in Dallas?" And it's like, "No, I want to fly direct,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1640" target="_blank">00:27:20.660</a></span> | <span class="t">and I want to do it at 10 a.m." So I just filter it out.

So if you have more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1842" target="_blank">00:30:42.500</a></span> | <span class="t">income, you're going to have a lot more to play with in those four key numbers, 50 to 60%, etc.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1847" target="_blank">00:30:47.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes.

It's easy to obsess over cutting costs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1854" target="_blank">00:30:54.500</a></span> | <span class="t">on freaking bread.

So there's a few ways of thinking about it. One, if you have a job,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1868" target="_blank">00:31:08.500</a></span> | <span class="t">learning the skill of raising your salary. That is a skill. That skill can be negotiating your salary.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1877" target="_blank">00:31:17.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And I have all kinds of scripts on exactly what to say to your boss, when, what to write in the email,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=1882" target="_blank">00:31:22.340</a></span> | <span class="t">what to say in the negotiation.

I think sometimes the big decisions matter, right? Here's an example that I'll throw</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2325" target="_blank">00:38:45.300</a></span> | <span class="t">out. And I want to kind of hear your perspective on it. Someone's thinking, "I want to decide if we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2330" target="_blank">00:38:50.420</a></span> | <span class="t">can take this trip," right? We listened to Ramit. We thought about this rich life. We said we want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2334" target="_blank">00:38:54.820</a></span> | <span class="t">travel. We're not. But we thought about how much of a safety net or emergency fund we want. And I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2340" target="_blank">00:39:00.180</a></span> | <span class="t">we're behind. How can we decide whether we take that trip now or we need to prioritize these other things?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2345" target="_blank">00:39:05.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Great question. This is the type of questions I wish people asked more of. "Hey, we actually decided we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2352" target="_blank">00:39:12.260</a></span> | <span class="t">want to do this, but like, can we afford it? How do we know if it fits?" These are great questions. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2356" target="_blank">00:39:16.740</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, there's some simple guidelines that I will give, and then we'll get into a bit of the nuance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2361" target="_blank">00:39:21.140</a></span> | <span class="t">If you have high interest debt like credit card debt, you're not taking a vacation. It just makes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2366" target="_blank">00:39:26.420</a></span> | <span class="t">no sense at all.

I go, "Not in my world. I move that money right to their credit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2378" target="_blank">00:39:38.740</a></span> | <span class="t">card debt. Pay that freaking thing off." And then we start to say things like, "Hey, we want a six-month</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2386" target="_blank">00:39:46.100</a></span> | <span class="t">emergency fund. We currently have four months. Should we fill that up before we go on vacation or should we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2395" target="_blank">00:39:55.140</a></span> | <span class="t">go on vacation?" Now, this is where I think you can apply your own decision-making skills. Personally,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2401" target="_blank">00:40:01.540</a></span> | <span class="t">if you have four months and you can afford to wait like six months, fill up your emergency fund, wait,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2406" target="_blank">00:40:06.260</a></span> | <span class="t">then go. On the other hand, I recently saw a post just a couple of days ago. Somebody said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2410" target="_blank">00:40:10.420</a></span> | <span class="t">"My mom had cancer and she did a family vacation to Hawaii.

So that to me is an obvious, "No, don't do that." That is how I start to think about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2451" target="_blank">00:40:51.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Then to get into some of the nuances, you want to make sure that, "Hey, do we have money set aside for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2456" target="_blank">00:40:56.340</a></span> | <span class="t">this vacation?

The point is not to save this money like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2553" target="_blank">00:42:33.460</a></span> | <span class="t">freaking Scrooge McDuck.

So again, it's planful. It's thoughtful. But you better believe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2579" target="_blank">00:42:59.860</a></span> | <span class="t">if I work hard and if I make more money, my life is going to get better.

In the example, you talked about the family that didn't take the vacation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2589" target="_blank">00:43:09.780</a></span> | <span class="t">It kind of hit on the fact that sometimes money decisions aren't rational. They're not financial.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2596" target="_blank">00:43:16.260</a></span> | <span class="t">They're emotional.

So we had bought this eighth of a vacation home and it was up in Napa. We'd gotten some great use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2609" target="_blank">00:43:29.540</a></span> | <span class="t">out of it. And we found with our kids schedules, which for anyone who has young children that aren't yet in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2614" target="_blank">00:43:34.500</a></span> | <span class="t">school, don't make the naive mistake I did, which was not realizing that your entire life will revolve</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2620" target="_blank">00:43:40.260</a></span> | <span class="t">around a school calendar as soon as they are in school. And so we had an eighth of a home. It was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2624" target="_blank">00:43:44.420</a></span> | <span class="t">awesome. I'm so glad we bought it. Then we had six weeks a year that we had to spread over a school</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2630" target="_blank">00:43:50.100</a></span> | <span class="t">schedule and it meant we were going to take every vacation up there. But the fractional real estate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2634" target="_blank">00:43:54.900</a></span> | <span class="t">market in Napa wasn't great. And we got an offer that was so-so and we were trying to figure out what to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2640" target="_blank">00:44:00.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And I called you and I said, "How should we be thinking about this? Because it's not a slam dunk</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2645" target="_blank">00:44:05.220</a></span> | <span class="t">to sell.

Okay. I'm very curious to hear what happened, but can you actually share what you heard</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2660" target="_blank">00:44:20.260</a></span> | <span class="t">me tell you?

So I did say, you know, I was worried like once you've bought this house, you kind of have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2667" target="_blank">00:44:27.460</a></span> | <span class="t">this fixed cost. You're committed to it. Would we be able to spend that same amount on a vacation if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2672" target="_blank">00:44:32.660</a></span> | <span class="t">we had to think about it every single time? And you said, "Don't keep an investment that you don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2678" target="_blank">00:44:38.660</a></span> | <span class="t">think is a great investment because you have an unhealthy relationship with spending money."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2683" target="_blank">00:44:43.540</a></span> | <span class="t">That was the takeaway. And I remember I called my wife right after and she was like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2686" target="_blank">00:44:46.740</a></span> | <span class="t">"Oh, what did Ramit say?" And I said, "If you have trouble spending money on vacation and you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2690" target="_blank">00:44:50.900</a></span> | <span class="t">the money, you need to fix that. And don't keep a house you don't want because you can't fix this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2696" target="_blank">00:44:56.740</a></span> | <span class="t">obvious problem." And at that moment we were like, "Yeah, that is true. We shouldn't keep doing that."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2703" target="_blank">00:45:03.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And the other advice, and maybe you weren't the one that gave me this piece that I talked to friends,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2706" target="_blank">00:45:06.740</a></span> | <span class="t">is they said, "Hey, every time you talk about this house, you're like, well, we're trying to sell it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2711" target="_blank">00:45:11.540</a></span> | <span class="t">You're never calling me to tell me how amazing the house is and how awesome it is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2715" target="_blank">00:45:15.700</a></span> | <span class="t">You're calling about some problem." That's every American homeowner. All they do is complain about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2719" target="_blank">00:45:19.220</a></span> | <span class="t">their godforsaken houses.

We negotiated a little bit of the offer, right? I think everyone should negotiate as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2728" target="_blank">00:45:28.740</a></span> | <span class="t">much as you can.

And I love that now you have the flexibility to not look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2752" target="_blank">00:45:52.180</a></span> | <span class="t">backwards, but to actually look forward. I'm curious, what are you going to do now that you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2757" target="_blank">00:45:57.140</a></span> | <span class="t">more flexibility? Well, it was funny because this summer and next summer, one of the things that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2761" target="_blank">00:46:01.860</a></span> | <span class="t">not great about owning a fractional piece of a home is we had to kind of schedule it out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2766" target="_blank">00:46:06.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So we were like, well, we have this week in August. We had next summer booked out. And now we were like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2770" target="_blank">00:46:10.900</a></span> | <span class="t">oh, what should we do in August?

We are not constrained by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2776" target="_blank">00:46:16.340</a></span> | <span class="t">anything in terms of where we go and what we do and what the schedule is. We don't really want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2781" target="_blank">00:46:21.620</a></span> | <span class="t">go on a big long trip because our daughter's having this surgery. And so we just found a place down in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2787" target="_blank">00:46:27.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Carmel and we're like, we're just going to book a trip there.

The other thing that I think is really hard for a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2797" target="_blank">00:46:37.620</a></span> | <span class="t">lot of people to process, especially when it comes to owning stock in a company or owning property,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2803" target="_blank">00:46:43.780</a></span> | <span class="t">things that have value that you resell that I think this wasn't my problem, but I know a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2808" target="_blank">00:46:48.980</a></span> | <span class="t">people that have it is, oh, well, the house is down. We're going to lose money. And maybe in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2812" target="_blank">00:46:52.740</a></span> | <span class="t">the future, it'll go up. My argument is like, there were two separate decisions we were making.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2817" target="_blank">00:46:57.860</a></span> | <span class="t">One was, do we want to sell this house? And it has a market value, right? You could say you think it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2822" target="_blank">00:47:02.660</a></span> | <span class="t">worth more because you paid more, but it's only worth whatever someone else is going to pay you for it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2826" target="_blank">00:47:06.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And so holding onto the house so it appreciates is the same as buying another. Like if I think it's really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2832" target="_blank">00:47:12.500</a></span> | <span class="t">going to appreciate, I should buy out all the other owners and own the whole thing. And then the other was,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2836" target="_blank">00:47:16.580</a></span> | <span class="t">we want to pay the monthly operating costs of the house, which we could choose. That was in our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2841" target="_blank">00:47:21.140</a></span> | <span class="t">control, what the price of the house wasn't. And so I don't actually feel like we lost money on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2847" target="_blank">00:47:27.220</a></span> | <span class="t">house in that we bought it. It's worth less. We didn't sell it for a loss. We sold it for the market</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2854" target="_blank">00:47:34.100</a></span> | <span class="t">rate now. Like it didn't feel like we were losing money in the moment. It just felt like we lost money</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2859" target="_blank">00:47:39.220</a></span> | <span class="t">in the long run, but we didn't accept a bad offer. In fact, we accepted a great offer. We negotiated it up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2864" target="_blank">00:47:44.100</a></span> | <span class="t">We didn't really lose on the price because we got a market price and we'd waited a year for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2868" target="_blank">00:47:48.900</a></span> | <span class="t">an offer. So it would be hard to imagine that waiting a year for someone to buy something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2872" target="_blank">00:47:52.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And you're like, well, I think it was worth more. No, it's probably worth about what it was paid for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2876" target="_blank">00:47:56.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So it feels great. It feels freeing. It seemed so obvious talking to you and a few other people that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2884" target="_blank">00:48:04.980</a></span> | <span class="t">what we should do. And I actually use this advice with a friend today. He was like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=2889" target="_blank">00:48:09.300</a></span> | <span class="t">someone made an offer to buy this company I've been building.

If something is going to have to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRpDqgyQeu4&t=3158" target="_blank">00:52:38.100</a></span> | <span class="t">get done anyway, why not do it sooner?
