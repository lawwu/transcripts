Uh, in particular, I have an article I want to talk</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=11" target="_blank">00:00:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">about that we didn't really get around to talking on the last episode, but we should have because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=15" target="_blank">00:00:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">it's by me. So when I publish new things, especially new things in the New Yorker,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=20" target="_blank">00:00:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I like to try to discuss them on the show in a little bit more depth, let you know what I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=25" target="_blank">00:00:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">thinking, maybe give you some more angles on it. So a couple of weeks ago, I published my latest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=31" target="_blank">00:00:31.520</a></span> | <span class="t">for the New Yorker. It's titled Tik Tok and the fall of the social media giants. If you are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=36" target="_blank">00:00:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">watching this episode instead of just listening. So if you're at youtube.com/calnewportmedia,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=40" target="_blank">00:00:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you'll see the article on your screen as well. Now, why I thought it was important to talk about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=45" target="_blank">00:00:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">this topic is not that I haven't talked about it before on the show, but because of the opposite</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=49" target="_blank">00:00:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">of that, I've talked about this topic a lot on the show. That's kind of what makes this cool for us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=55" target="_blank">00:00:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">This is one of the first instances, I would say, of an idea whose birth was this podcast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=61" target="_blank">00:01:01.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I began bouncing these ideas around here with you, my listeners, and it evolved into a more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=68" target="_blank">00:01:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">polished form, the New Yorker. So here we are, Deep Questions podcast impacting the world of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=75" target="_blank">00:01:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">news. So you've heard these ideas before, but they're a lot more polished now. So let's go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">through it quickly. So I begin the article quoting Blake Chanley, Tik Tok's president of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=88" target="_blank">00:01:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Global Business Solutions, talking about competition from Facebook. This is where he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">said, look, we're not worried. Facebook is a social platform built on a social graph. Tik</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=99" target="_blank">00:01:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Tok is an entertainment platform. These are two different things. Zuckerberg needs to stay in his</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">lane. We have our own lane. That name should sound familiar. Blake Chanley, I talked about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=108" target="_blank">00:01:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">him on the show because I discovered this interview from one of you, my listeners, sent it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to me at my interesting@calnewport.com email address. So then I went deeper into this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=118" target="_blank">00:01:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So here's the next point I want to make. So in the article, I make this point that Facebook</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">is trying to shift to be more like Tik Tok. Instagram, owned by the same company, shifting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to be more like Tik Tok. And the way they are doing this is by moving towards video,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">moving towards short video, but most importantly, as I'll soon elaborate,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.480</a></span> | <span class="t">moving towards recommendations that have nothing to do with the social graph, moving towards feeds</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that are generated purely by algorithms, not by who you follow, not by people you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">sharing it. So here's the quote from the article. This shift is not surprising, given Tik Tok's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.520</a></span> | <span class="t">phenomenal popularity, and it has been very successful, but it's also short sighted.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So the whole thesis of the article is the following. I say, platforms like Facebook</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">could be doomed if they fail to maintain the social graphs upon which they built their kingdoms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is the setup to this whole article. Tik Tok's really popular. Companies like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">platforms like Facebook, I should say, are trying to be more Tik Tok like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to stave off the competition and try to have faster user growth. This could, however, doom them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, so let me elaborate this argument. What I'm getting at in this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the original take on this point is there's real advantages to having an online company like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Facebook or Instagram, or as you'll see, Twitter, that relies on a social graph.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And to be clear, by social graph, I mean, all of these individual friend requests,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">all these individual follow clicks, this topology of connections that human users built up,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">click by click, decision by decision over months and months and years and years of use,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">these really rich networks, these give a real advantage to the early mover platforms who have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">built them up. One is a network effect advantage. So I'm highlighting these here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So I mentioned, for example, once Facebook had 100 million followers, active users, I should say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">which it got by 2006, it became hard for anyone else to compete on a model of the people you know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">are here. And so you can see what the people you know are up to. Once you have 100 million users</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">on one platform, how do you start from scratch and say, well, we only have 10,000, but we're growing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's a huge network effect advantage. There are also other advantages to these topologies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I talk a little bit in this article about the introduction of the retweet button to Twitter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I think people don't understand the degree to which the introduction of the retweet button</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">not only made Twitter into a lasting company of cultural influence, but also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">really transformed social media. So here's what happened when they introduced the retweet button.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">The friction required to send a link or tweet to your entire follower base went down to almost</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">nothing. Before we had the retweet button, people in Twitter would have to copy tweets and they would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">put RT. So you remember this, if you're old enough, you would put RT in caps colon, and then you would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">quote, just copy and paste quote, the tweet that you're retweeting. And then you would put at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">original person who retweeted it below it. That's a pain. Retweet button, you see something you like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=328" target="_blank">00:05:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">click a button and it spreads. That reduction in friction made all of the difference. It unlocked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=334" target="_blank">00:05:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">what I call a fierce viral dynamic. So now a tweet that was catching the attention of the zeitgeist</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">in the right way, could spread through the power law topology of the Twitter social graph at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=348" target="_blank">00:05:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">frightening speed. Tens of millions, hundreds of millions of people could see something within</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=353" target="_blank">00:05:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">an hour or two. And this all was based off these individual user decisions to retweet or not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">retweet. They see it from a few people, they retweet it. This turned out to have two hugely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.520</a></span> | <span class="t">powerful effects. One, it attracted more interesting people to platforms like Twitter,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">because there's potential here. You had the potential of reaching millions of people if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=374" target="_blank">00:06:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">what you wrote caught on just right. So now more interesting people came to Twitter.

So that was very effective. So suddenly Twitter not only had</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=430" target="_blank">00:07:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">interesting people on there, but it had this really good human powered curation, distributed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=434" target="_blank">00:07:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">curation algorithm that meant when you went on Twitter, you were going to see interesting things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=438" target="_blank">00:07:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">or funny things or outrageous things.

That's very powerful.

So here's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=986" target="_blank">00:16:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the key nuance, which by the way, based on your feedback as listeners, I knew to really hit this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=993" target="_blank">00:16:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">point in my New Yorker piece. TikTok of course is subject to the same pressures. So in this future,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=999" target="_blank">00:16:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">it too will eventually fade.

I think it's going to, it's coming in hot Twitter, maybe, but definitely Facebook,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=1064" target="_blank">00:17:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">definitely Instagram chases it, destabilizes their competitive advantage, leads to their downfall.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=1069" target="_blank">00:17:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">The only reason why I say maybe with Twitter is it has investor pressure, but as we saw with the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=1075" target="_blank">00:17:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Elon Musk bid, they're small enough.

So you can, you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=1275" target="_blank">00:21:15.040</a></span> | <span class="t">follow suit if you subscribe. So you get the daily email and that points out like what's going on,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=1280" target="_blank">00:21:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">what was posted on the web that day. What's interesting. So I would say 50% of the daily</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=1286" target="_blank">00:21:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">emails will point out an article that I ended up reading on the web because they published like a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=1291" target="_blank">00:21:31.040</a></span> | <span class="t">new article every day on the web. Uh, for the magazine, my rule is like, you always have to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=1295" target="_blank">00:21:35.520</a></span> | <span class="t">read one and if there's more, sometimes you'll read more than one, but you always have to read</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=1300" target="_blank">00:21:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">one. And so that forces you, even if it's a day where the five articles, none of them are right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=1304" target="_blank">00:21:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">in your sweet spot. You read about door-to-door salesman or something else. It's really interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=1307" target="_blank">00:21:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's my role. Read the daily email to see what catches your attention. That's where a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=1312" target="_blank">00:21:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">of my stuff is featured. So definitely read that. And then you got to read one, one per week,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=1316" target="_blank">00:21:56.640</a></span> | <span class="t">at least. I have a similar rule too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=1319" target="_blank">00:21:59.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. I just look at the table of contents and then circle two. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=1322" target="_blank">00:22:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">if there's two I like, then I read them. And then otherwise,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=1325" target="_blank">00:22:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and then it breaks the seal and then you end up reading more a lot of times, but like, you always</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=1328" target="_blank">00:22:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">have to read at least one. Oh, and then the third rule is you have to leave the magazine out kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=1333" target="_blank">00:22:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">of prominently in your house or apartment and like, Oh, when people come over, Oh, sorry, let me just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=1337" target="_blank">00:22:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">clean this up over here. I just was, you got to put it next to your copy of the Harper's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=1342" target="_blank">00:22:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and the Paris.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=1344" target="_blank">00:22:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you recycle them a lot quickly thereafter?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_KMqhC8-XI&t=1347" target="_blank">00:22:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. It was just when the pile grows, I suppose.</span></div></div></body></html>
