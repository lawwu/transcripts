And right now we don't bother with that because we can hoover up more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_WsPbdJKUg&t=499" target="_blank">00:08:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">data from the internet. We're getting towards the end of that. But yeah, as the AIs get more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_WsPbdJKUg&t=504" target="_blank">00:08:24.480</a></span> | <span class="t">sophisticated, they'll be better able to tell what is a useful kind of skill to practice and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_WsPbdJKUg&t=511" target="_blank">00:08:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">to generate that. And we've done that in other areas. So AlphaGo, the original version of AlphaGo</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_WsPbdJKUg&t=517" target="_blank">00:08:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">was booted up with data from human Go play and then improved with reinforcement learning and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_WsPbdJKUg&t=524" target="_blank">00:08:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Monte Carlo tree search. But then AlphaZero, with a somewhat more sophisticated model,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_WsPbdJKUg&t=532" target="_blank">00:08:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">benefited from some other improvements, but was able to go from scratch. And it generated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_WsPbdJKUg&t=540" target="_blank">00:09:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">its own data through self-play, so getting data of a higher quality than the human data,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_WsPbdJKUg&t=547" target="_blank">00:09:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">because there are no human players that good available in the dataset. And also a curriculum,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_WsPbdJKUg&t=553" target="_blank">00:09:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">so that at any given point, it was playing games against an opponent of equal skill itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_WsPbdJKUg&t=560" target="_blank">00:09:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it was always in an area when it was easy to learn. If you're just always losing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_WsPbdJKUg&t=565" target="_blank">00:09:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">no matter what you do, or always winning, no matter what you do, it's hard to distinguish</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_WsPbdJKUg&t=570" target="_blank">00:09:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">which things are better and which are worse. And when we have somewhat more sophisticated AIs that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_WsPbdJKUg&t=576" target="_blank">00:09:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">can generate training data and tasks for themselves, for example, if the AI can generate a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_WsPbdJKUg&t=581" target="_blank">00:09:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">lot of unit tests and then can try and produce programs that pass those unit tests, then the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_WsPbdJKUg&t=588" target="_blank">00:09:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">interpreter is providing a training signal. And the AI can get good at figuring out what's the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_WsPbdJKUg&t=595" target="_blank">00:09:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of programming problem that is hard for AIs right now that will develop more of the skills</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_WsPbdJKUg&t=601" target="_blank">00:10:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">that I need and then do them. And now you're not going to have employees at OpenAI write like a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_WsPbdJKUg&t=608" target="_blank">00:10:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">billion programming problems. That's just not going to happen. But you are going to have AIs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_WsPbdJKUg&t=614" target="_blank">00:10:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">given the task of producing those enormous number of programming challenges.</span></div></div></body></html>
