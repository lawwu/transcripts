This is a particularly exciting talk for us because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8HbIJh2wpQ&t=18" target="_blank">00:00:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">we've been working with private clients for about a year now, but this is the first time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8HbIJh2wpQ&t=22" target="_blank">00:00:22.360</a></span> | <span class="t">we've really talked about it in public since our launch last week. I'm incredibly proud</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8HbIJh2wpQ&t=29" target="_blank">00:00:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">of the work we've done so far and excited to take a few minutes to tell you about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8HbIJh2wpQ&t=34" target="_blank">00:00:34.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you look at the products out there that have really successfully leveraged this generation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8HbIJh2wpQ&t=41" target="_blank">00:00:41.380</a></span> | <span class="t">of AI, I think one thing is true about nearly all of them is that they're using more than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8HbIJh2wpQ&t=47" target="_blank">00:00:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">one inference runs, often many different types of models in tandem to accomplish a specific</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8HbIJh2wpQ&t=53" target="_blank">00:00:53.080</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of task really well. And I think people really quickly realized that the foundation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8HbIJh2wpQ&t=59" target="_blank">00:00:59.580</a></span> | <span class="t">model is not enough. And even very simple tasks like summarizing a document to much, much more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8HbIJh2wpQ&t=67" target="_blank">00:01:07.540</a></span> | <span class="t">complex tasks like solving coding problems end to end, I think the best products right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8HbIJh2wpQ&t=72" target="_blank">00:01:12.300</a></span> | <span class="t">now are all using systems of inference runs in a logical structure. So I think at Substrate,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8HbIJh2wpQ&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.300</a></span> | <span class="t">we believe that building with modular intelligence is always going to be more effective than building</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8HbIJh2wpQ&t=87" target="_blank">00:01:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">with a monolithic intelligence. These systems are inherently more legible, which means you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8HbIJh2wpQ&t=93" target="_blank">00:01:33.300</a></span> | <span class="t">can understand them structurally, which means that they're debuggable and they're extensible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8HbIJh2wpQ&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And evals become a lot easier because the decision trees are explicit and you can sort</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8HbIJh2wpQ&t=104" target="_blank">00:01:44.140</a></span> | <span class="t">of verify at every step what's going on and what's going wrong. So Substrate, I think, is sort</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8HbIJh2wpQ&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.140</a></span> | <span class="t">of a new way, new approach to this. I think our model is sort of fast in ways that other paradigms</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8HbIJh2wpQ&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">can't be. It's sort of flexible enough to build any AI product out there. And it works to scale</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8HbIJh2wpQ&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.960</a></span> | <span class="t">by default. So what is it? I think at its core, Substrate is a coupling of two things. First,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8HbIJh2wpQ&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's a really elegant developer SDK that lets you describe a computation graph over any number of nodes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8HbIJh2wpQ&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And the abstractions here are really general and so we have a bunch of intelligence nodes across all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8HbIJh2wpQ&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.180</a></span> | <span class="t">the modalities that you might care about, which is like generating images, transcribing speech,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8HbIJh2wpQ&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.980</a></span> | <span class="t">generating text, JSON embeddings, executing code. But second, Substrate is also an inference engine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8HbIJh2wpQ&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.180</a></span> | <span class="t">specifically built to run these computation graphs as efficiently as possible. So these graph representations</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8HbIJh2wpQ&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.620</a></span> | <span class="t">here are -- it's a representation of many tasks and their relationships. And since we run a very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8HbIJh2wpQ&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.380</a></span> | <span class="t">coordinated compute cluster, we can statically and dynamically optimize things like batching, caching,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8HbIJh2wpQ&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.700</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of networking, concurrency, physical placement, which really makes a big difference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8HbIJh2wpQ&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you look at most frameworks out there, they're typically involving dispatching a bunch of API</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8HbIJh2wpQ&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.460</a></span> | <span class="t">calls separately. And if you look at what happens mechanically when you do that, it's -- every step</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8HbIJh2wpQ&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.300</a></span> | <span class="t">means you've got to resolve DNS, you've got to go through proxies, you've got it through authentication,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8HbIJh2wpQ&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.100</a></span> | <span class="t">like balance checks. And all of that sort of adds hundreds of milliseconds of latency on every single</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8HbIJh2wpQ&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.700</a></span> | <span class="t">step. And if you contrast that with Substrate, we transfer data from node to node, process to process</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8HbIJh2wpQ&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.860</a></span> | <span class="t">on the order of microseconds, which is some 10,000 times faster, meaning that it's actually feasible now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8HbIJh2wpQ&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.300</a></span> | <span class="t">to run online applications that involve dozens of nodes. We've also noticed that JSON decoding is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8HbIJh2wpQ&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.940</a></span> | <span class="t">is one of the most useful patterns for multi-inference runs. And I think we've invested a lot into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8HbIJh2wpQ&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.860</a></span> | <span class="t">offering a best-in-class JSON mode, both in terms of reliability and speed. And if you look at all of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8HbIJh2wpQ&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.060</a></span> | <span class="t">this together, I think what it means is that Substrate is really a way that -- a way to enable higher quality</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8HbIJh2wpQ&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.820</a></span> | <span class="t">outcomes with AI, letting you work in a system that's more flexible, it's more legible, it's more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8HbIJh2wpQ&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.780</a></span> | <span class="t">verifiable than any of the current paradigms that sort of exist now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8HbIJh2wpQ&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.700</a></span> | <span class="t">I think there's a lot more to say.
