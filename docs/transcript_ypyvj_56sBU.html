Hey, so great to see everyone here at AI Engineer World's Fair. Andre and I have the honor of curating the GraphRag track, which is happening here. And I thought the jokes Simon had about bugs were -- Spot on. Spot on, hilarious. And that's the reason why we care so much about getting really good data, like building a solid foundation, and good grounding for models.</p><p>And we're going to chat a bit because I think we have a social responsibility. We're getting so close to AGI as an industry. We have a social responsibility to kind of see what the boundaries, and what the limits are of this. And as proper computer scientists, the answer is, always look at science fiction for the answer.</p><p>Look to the past to see the future. Exactly. Okay. So, play along with us. What we're going to do is we'll each play off a riff on a sci-fi meme. Give a big round of applause either if you think it's true or funny, or if you just like the movie.</p><p>All right. You're up first, ABK. Okay. Starting off with Memento. In the Memento, the main character has really bad short-term memory. He has a specific disease, so he can't remember what happened 15 minutes ago. This is the essence of prompt engineering. All right. Round of applause. Okay. Okay. Okay.</p><p>All right. Skynet. The mandatory fear-mongering. Even without evil intent, autonomous systems can make reasonable-seeming decisions have awful unforeseen consequences. Oh. Oh. Okay. That's a little better. All right. Your turn. Okay. The matrix, of course, for Neo4j. We love it. And for now, agents live in a simulation that we're creating for them.</p><p>Will we notice when they flip the script and we're living in their simulation? Oh. A little bit. I think that's the winner so far. I know. That's close. Off to you. All right. Hal warned us about trust issues, lack of transparency, misaligned galls, the erosion of human oversight, and the potential for deception.</p><p>Okay. This is very short. Are emotions a bug or a feature? My personal favorite. I love this one. Okay. Okay. So we got a little monster reference here. What are the obligations and social responsibilities of the creator? Us. Should we be kind or threatening? Costing tokens. All right. We'll take that as a flat.</p><p>Okay. Your turn. I'm the Terminator. Should we go ahead and just invent time travel now? All right. We got a big thumbs up on time travel. Except time travel. Okay. Go. Okay. A good Star Wars one. Can AGI truly grasp the nuances of human language and culture or will forever misunderstand the meaning of sarcasm and idioms?</p><p>And amazing jokes. Okay. When AGI arrives and we finally have a globe spanning multi-agent system with the hive mind, will we be assimilated or will we be pets? Okay. Last one. Just like Deep Thought's famous answer, we might have the tools to build AGI, but do we even know what the right questions are?</p><p>All right. So that one was good as well. All right. So come by the GraphRag track. We're going to reveal which of these ten memes are solved by graphs and graph technology. And join us in Golden Gate B. Thank you very much. Thank you, everyone. Thank you. Thank you.</p><p>We'll see you next time.</p></div></div></body></html>
