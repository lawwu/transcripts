href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkZz2I6sK08&t=155" target="_blank">00:02:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's a brilliant visualization because almost nothing happens for most of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkZz2I6sK08&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So what blows your mind most about
