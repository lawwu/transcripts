where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkZz2I6sK08&t=152">00:02:32.200</a></span> | <span class="t">each page is 250 years.</span></div><div

thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkZz2I6sK08&t=183">00:03:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But then you get to page 950, and things start moving.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkZz2I6sK08&t=187">00:03:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Recorded history starts at
