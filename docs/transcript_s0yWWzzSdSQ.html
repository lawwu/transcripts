And just for frame of reference, about 21 to 24% of Americans, they can't even perform basic tasks like identifying the expiry date of a driver's license, for example.</p><p>And if they're not capable of doing this, doesn't that mean that the theory of universal explainers falls apart? So these tasks that you're talking about are tasks that no ape could do. However, there are humans who are brain damaged to the extent that they can't even do the tasks that an ape can do.</p><p>And there comes a point when installing the program that would, you know, be able to read a driver's license or whatever, would require augmenting their hardware as well as their software. If it's 24% of the population, then it's definitely not hardware. If it's software, it is not just a matter of them wanting to, it is a matter of whether the existing software is conceptually ready to do that.</p></div></div></body></html>
