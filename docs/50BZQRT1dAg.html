target="_blank">00:00:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">not the least of which is that they explore the interaction between the psychology of self, self-exploration,</span></div><div class="c"><span

learned about Robert's work from reading the book "Mastery," which, to my mind, is a brilliant exploration</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50BZQRT1dAg&t=56" target="_blank">00:00:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and a practical tool for how to think about and pursue one's purpose.</span></div><div

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50BZQRT1dAg&t=72" target="_blank">00:01:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We talk about the selection of a life partner, as well as romantic and other types of

target="_blank">00:01:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">which arose during our discussion of Robert's recent stroke.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

how to write, how to exercise,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50BZQRT1dAg&t=93" target="_blank">00:01:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">indeed,

allow you to navigate forward along the path to your purpose, perhaps find your purpose if you feel you haven't done that yet,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50BZQRT1dAg&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">as well as to greatly enhance your relationship with yourself, with others, and

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50BZQRT1dAg&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Waking Up is a meditation app that includes hundreds of meditation programs, mindfulness trainings, yoga nidra sessions, and NSDR, non-sleep deep-rest protocols.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50BZQRT1dAg&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I started using the Waking Up app a few years ago because even though I've been doing regular meditation since my teens, and I started doing yoga nidra about a decade ago,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50BZQRT1dAg&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">my dad mentioned to me that he had found an app, turned out to be the Waking Up app, which could teach you meditations of different durations,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50BZQRT1dAg&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and that had a lot of different types of meditations to place the brain and body into different states, and that he liked it very much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50BZQRT1dAg&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I gave the Waking Up app a try, and I too found it to be extremely useful because sometimes I only have a few minutes to meditate, other times I have longer to meditate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50BZQRT1dAg&t=305" target="_blank">00:05:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And indeed, I love the fact that I can explore different types of meditation to bring about different levels of understanding about consciousness,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50BZQRT1dAg&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but also to place my brain and body into lots of different kinds of states, depending on which meditation I do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50BZQRT1dAg&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I also love that the Waking Up app has lots of different types of yoga nidra sessions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50BZQRT1dAg&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">For those

the idea that something as primitive as mounting, just like something as primitive as biting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50BZQRT1dAg&t=4396"

target="_blank">01:43:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think there's a role for that process that you spell out in mastery in the larger context of like who to become as a person and that

for their help.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50BZQRT1dAg&t=6604" target="_blank">01:50:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And a lot of people

powerful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50BZQRT1dAg&t=6620" target="_blank">01:50:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it's building your

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50BZQRT1dAg&t=6652" target="_blank">01:50:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then writing down your own ideas and writing a book, well, that's the big win, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50BZQRT1dAg&t=6658" target="_blank">01:50:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's what the world, I believe that's what the universe wants from us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50BZQRT1dAg&t=6662" target="_blank">01:51:02.000</a></span> | <span

mimicking them and kind of just learning the exteriors of their ideas.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50BZQRT1dAg&t=6679" target="_blank">01:51:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You want to kind of digest them and then have them slowly become your own ideas by interacting with them and by putting them through your own lens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50BZQRT1dAg&t=6690" target="_blank">01:51:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So someday, it's a book stirring in me, is the art of thinking and how to use that kind of process and go deeper into it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50BZQRT1dAg&t=6700" target="_blank">01:51:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I talked a lot about it in one of my podcasts, which might be the seed of a book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50BZQRT1dAg&t=6706" target="_blank">01:51:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's the difference between dead thinking and alive thinking.</span></div><div

dead.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50BZQRT1dAg&t=6714" target="_blank">01:51:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And an alive idea is something that enters your brain from an external source, a philosopher, an article, somebody you admire, somebody you hate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50BZQRT1dAg&t=6724" target="_blank">01:52:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you absorb it and you think about it and you decide, I'm going to turn it around into this and I'm going to make it alive and make it something that's part of me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50BZQRT1dAg&t=6735" target="_blank">01:52:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Another part of an alive idea is you have an idea that comes to you about a book or a project or something about the world.</span></div><div

true.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50BZQRT1dAg&t=6746" target="_blank">01:52:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe the opposite is true.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50BZQRT1dAg&t=6748" target="_blank">01:52:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And you go through a process and you cycle through it on and on and you reflect on it and you refine this idea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50BZQRT1dAg&t=6754" target="_blank">01:52:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And maybe it turns into its opposite.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50BZQRT1dAg&t=6756" target="_blank">01:52:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And through the process of reflecting and correcting and revising it, you turn it into something living, something alive within you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50BZQRT1dAg&t=6764" target="_blank">01:52:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?

Then you're going to make a much better choice on and on and on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50BZQRT1dAg&t=6863" target="_blank">01:54:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're a creative person, it's very, very challenging to have that blank piece of paper before you, that book that you haven't written, that film or whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50BZQRT1dAg&t=6874" target="_blank">01:54:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You're filled with a lot of anxiety and you have to deal with it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50BZQRT1dAg&t=6878" target="_blank">01:54:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you're able to turn it into something creative and productive, then great things will happen. You'll create a masterpiece.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50BZQRT1dAg&t=6884" target="_blank">01:54:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the ability to deal with anxiety and to not give into the most instant gratification that you can get is to me a marker of somebody who will be creative and will invent something as opposed to people who just recycle old and dead ideas.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50BZQRT1dAg&t=6899" target="_blank">01:54:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Amen

makes children of us all and not in the positive sense of being childlike.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50BZQRT1dAg&t=6910" target="_blank">01:55:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It regresses us to a mode where we feel a complete lack of control.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50BZQRT1dAg&t=6914" target="_blank">01:55:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I completely agree that being able to manage anxiety and dance with it, since we can't rid ourselves of it, perhaps nor should we.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50BZQRT1dAg&t=6923" target="_blank">01:55:23.000</a></span> |
