The tendency is to say like, well, it's because money, like more is better is the mindset people have had. And everyone's wired differently around this. One person might feel lonely if they have only 100 friends.</p><p>Another person might feel lonely as long if they have only have one friend, like what social wealth means to different people will be different because you have a natural level of introversion or extroversion, and you need to figure out what level of connection fills your cup. It doesn't matter if it's the same, I am more extroverted than my wife.</p><p>My wife really just needs her like very close network of a few friends and family to feel extraordinarily socially wealthy, I need a bigger group of people like I need to feel like I can reach out to different people who have expertise on different things and problems that I'm facing.</p><p>And that's what makes me feel good. But it's different for all of us. So figuring out your sort of natural set point or baseline, if you will, that you're kind of working towards is important.</p></div></div></body></html>
