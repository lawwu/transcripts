What computer science-based venture capital is able to do is it was able to productize 50 prior years of basic research in computer science biotech where, you know, that, that sector we're productizing basically the work that NIH. Right. And others, you know, put into basic research and the biological sciences.</p><p>And he said, you know, that, that was, you know, about half as much money. Um, and maybe about like half as much time. Look, he said, the problem is there aren't other sectors that have had these huge investments in basic research. And so he says, look, he says, if you want to predict the future of venture capital, you basically just look at where, you know, the previous 50 years of where research R and D, you know, basic research has happened.</p></div></div></body></html>
