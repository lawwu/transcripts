The bullets took his brother. This stubborn love held on. The sky was filled with fire. Millions lost in flames. Hate and love were all there. The world never the same. Some days will sink in sadness. The weight of them too tough. Don't lose yourself to madness. The way out is love. When New York towers crumble, we're all New Yorkers too. For a moment all just human, at the same old red or blue. And the wicked will go on scheming for the power and the pain. But the heart that longs for freedom is a fire they'll never tame. Some days will sink in sadness. The weight of them too tough. Don't lose yourself to madness. The way out is love.  The virus took a comfort that was never ours to own. When the enemy is inside us, we're together but alone. This life is so dim and fragile, a leaf caught in the wind. But every breath that's tragic ignites a hope within. Some days will sink in sadness. The weight of them too tough. Don't lose yourself to madness. The way out is love.</p></div></body></html>
