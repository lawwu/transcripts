Since then, we've basically seen these very computation-intensive, but fundamentally simple AI systems achieve a lot of progress on a lot of different unrelated tasks. It's looking to me like not totally crazy to imagine that the current way people are developing AI systems, cutting-edge AI systems, could take us all the way to the kind of extremely powerful AI systems that automate roughly everything humans do to advance science and technology.</p><p>It's not so wild to imagine that we could just keep on going with these systems, make them bigger, put more work into them, but basically stay on the same path, and you could get there. If you imagine doing that, it becomes a little bit less daunting to imagine the risks that might come up and the things we could do about them.</p><p>I don't think it's necessarily the leading possibility, but it's enough to start thinking concretely about the problem.</p></div></div></body></html>
