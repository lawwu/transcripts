href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=31" target="_blank">00:00:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to start by sharing this beautiful video from John Robinson, Robinson, I should</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=37" target="_blank">00:00:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">say, and I've never seen anything like this before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=42" target="_blank">00:00:42.540</a></span> | <span class="t">As you can see, it's very stable and it's really showing this beautiful movement between</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=49" target="_blank">00:00:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">seasons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=52" target="_blank">00:00:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So what I did on the forum was I said to folks, "Hey, you should try interpolating between</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=57" target="_blank">00:00:57.960</a></span> | <span class="t">prompts," which is what John did.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=59" target="_blank">00:00:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And I also said, "You should try using the last image of the previous prompt interpolation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=69" target="_blank">00:01:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">as the initial image for the next prompt."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=72" target="_blank">00:01:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And anyway, here it is, it came out beautifully, John was the first to get that working, so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=77" target="_blank">00:01:17.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I was very excited about that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And the second one I wanted to show you is this really amazing work from Seb Derhi, who,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=96" target="_blank">00:01:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Sebastian, who did something that I'd been thinking about as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=102" target="_blank">00:01:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm really thrilled that he also thought about this, which was he noticed that this update</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.800</a></span> | <span class="t">we do, unconditional embeddings plus guidance times text embeddings minus unconditional</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=117" target="_blank">00:01:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">embeddings, has a bit of a problem, which is that it gets big.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.680</a></span> | <span class="t">To show you what I mean by it gets big is like, imagine that we've got a couple of vectors</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">on this chart here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we've got, let's see, so we've got, that's just, okay, so we've got the original</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.720</a></span> | <span class="t">unconditional piece here, so we've got U. So let's say this is U. And then we add to that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.420</a></span> | <span class="t">some amount of T minus U. So if we've got like T, let's say it's huge, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And we've got U again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Then the difference between those is the vector which goes here, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Now you can see here that if there's a big difference between T and U, then the eventual</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">update which actually happens is, oopsie daisy, I thought that was going to be an arrow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's try that again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">The eventual update which happens is far bigger than the original update.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it jumps too far.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So this idea is basically to say, well, let's make it so that the update is no longer than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the original unconditioned update would have been.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And we're going to be talking more about norms later, but basically we scale it by the ratio</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">of the norms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And what happens is we start with this astronaut and we move to this astronaut.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's kind of, it's a subtle change, but you can see there's a lot more before, after,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">before, after, a lot more texture in the background.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And like on the Earth, there's a lot more detail before, after, you see that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And even little things like before, the bridal kind of rains, whatever were pretty flimsy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Now they look quite proper.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's made quite a big difference just to kind of get this scaling correct.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's a couple of other things that Sebastian tried, which I'll explain in a moment, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.880</a></span> | <span class="t">you can see how they, some of them actually resulted in changing the image.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And this one's actually important because the poor horse used to be missing a leg and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">now it's not missing a leg, so that's good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And so here's the detailed one with its extra leg.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So how did he do this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, so what he did was he started with this unconditioned prompt plus the guidance times</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.240</a></span> | <span class="t">the difference between the conditional and unconditioned.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then as we discussed, the next version, well, actually the next version we then saw</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.880</a></span> | <span class="t">is to basically just take that prediction and scale it according to the difference in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the lengths.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So the norms is basically the length of the vectors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this is the second one I did in lesson nine, you'll see it's gone from here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So when we go from 1a to 1b, you can see here, it's got, look at this, this boot's gone from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.520</a></span> | <span class="t">nothing to having texture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=348" target="_blank">00:05:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">This whatever the hell this thing is, suddenly he's got texture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And look, we've now got proper stars in the sky.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=355" target="_blank">00:05:55.700</a></span> | <span class="t">It's made a really big difference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=357" target="_blank">00:05:57.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the second change is not just to rescale the whole prediction, but to rescale</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">the update.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">When we rescale the update, it actually not surprisingly changes the image entirely because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=371" target="_blank">00:06:11.800</a></span> | <span class="t">we're now changing the direction it goes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=375" target="_blank">00:06:15.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I don't know, is this better than this?</span></div><div class="c"><span

ago where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=548" target="_blank">00:09:08.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I said he was doing some

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=558" target="_blank">00:09:18.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Because I think the key thing is once the model kind of knows roughly what image it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=562" target="_blank">00:09:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">trying to draw, even if it's

this is exactly what's happening here is Rakhil's idea is to say, "Well, let's decrease</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=574" target="_blank">00:09:34.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the guidance scale."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=575"

target="_blank">00:09:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And so once it kind of is in going in the right direction, we let it do its thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=581" target="_blank">00:09:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So this little doggy is with the normal 7.5 guidance scale.</span></div><div

here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=589" target="_blank">00:09:49.720</a></span> | <span class="t">It's pretty uninteresting, pretty

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=912" target="_blank">00:15:12.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And so later on, I can go and like, if I want to check some detail, I can go back and see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=916" target="_blank">00:15:16.460</a></span> | <span class="t">the URL, I can click on it, pops

to do is I'm going to double click on it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=924" target="_blank">00:15:24.620</a></span> | <span

I've started this Fast Diffusion folder, which is actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=950" target="_blank">00:15:50.760</a></span> | <span class="t">a group library, which I share with the other folks working on this Fast Diffusion project</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=958" target="_blank">00:15:58.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we can all see the same paper library.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=963" target="_blank">00:16:03.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So Maribou on YouTube chat is asking, is this better than Mendeley?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=967" target="_blank">00:16:07.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I used to use Mendeley and it's kind of gone downhill.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=971" target="_blank">00:16:11.380</a></span> | <span class="t">I think Zotero is far, far better, but they're both very similar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=975" target="_blank">00:16:15.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so when you double click on it, it opens up and here is a paper.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=983" target="_blank">00:16:23.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So reading a paper is always extremely intimidating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=992" target="_blank">00:16:32.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you just have to do it anyway and you have to realize that your goal is not to understand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=998" target="_blank">00:16:38.740</a></span> | <span class="t">every word.</span></div><div

that, for example, when you look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1006" target="_blank">00:16:46.500</a></span> | <span class="t">at the code, hopefully it comes with code, most things do, that you'll be able to kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1011" target="_blank">00:16:51.100</a></span> | <span class="t">of see how the code matches to it and that you could try writing your own code to implement</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1016" target="_blank">00:16:56.060</a></span> | <span class="t">parts of it yourself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1018" target="_blank">00:16:58.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So over on the left, you can open up the sidebar here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1021" target="_blank">00:17:01.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So I generally open up the table of contents and get a bit of a sense of, okay, so there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1027" target="_blank">00:17:07.300</a></span> | <span class="t">some experimental results, there's some theoretical results, introduction, related work, okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1036" target="_blank">00:17:16.100</a></span> | <span class="t">tells us about this new diff edit thing, some experiments, okay.</span></div><div

in papers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1046" target="_blank">00:17:26.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So I would always start with the abstract, okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1048" target="_blank">00:17:28.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So what's it saying this does?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1052" target="_blank">00:17:32.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So generally it's going to be some background sentence or two about how interesting this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1055"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1059" target="_blank">00:17:39.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And then they're going to tell us what they're going to do, which is they're going to create</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1061" target="_blank">00:17:41.500</a></span> | <span class="t">something called diff

for?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1070" target="_blank">00:17:50.860</a></span> | <span class="t">It's going to use text condition

those are now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1074" target="_blank">00:17:54.820</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what we've been

target="_blank">00:18:01.300</a></span> | <span class="t">But this is going to be different.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1082" target="_blank">00:18:02.380</a></span> | <span class="t">It's the task of semantic image editing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

later.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1090" target="_blank">00:18:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">The goal is to edit an image

here's an input image.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1122" target="_blank">00:18:42.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And originally it was attached to a caption, a bowl of fruits.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1126" target="_blank">00:18:46.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1127" target="_blank">00:18:47.820</a></span> | <span class="t">We want to change this into a bowl of pairs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1130" target="_blank">00:18:50.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So we type a bowl of pairs and it generates, oh, a bowl of pairs, or we could change it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1139" target="_blank">00:18:59.580</a></span> | <span class="t">from a bowl of fruit to a basket of fruits and oh, it's become a basket of fruits.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1144" target="_blank">00:19:04.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1145" target="_blank">00:19:05.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think I get the idea, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1149" target="_blank">00:19:09.180</a></span> | <span class="t">What it's saying is that we can edit an image by typing what we want that image to represent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1155" target="_blank">00:19:15.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So this actually looks a lot like the paper that we looked at last week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1161" target="_blank">00:19:21.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1166" target="_blank">00:19:26.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So the abstract says that currently, so I guess there are current ways of doing this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1170" target="_blank">00:19:30.820</a></span> | <span class="t">but they require you to provide a mask.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1172" target="_blank">00:19:32.820</a></span> | <span class="t">That means you have to basically draw the area you're replacing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1175" target="_blank">00:19:35.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1176" target="_blank">00:19:36.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So that sounds really annoying, but our main contribution.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1179" target="_blank">00:19:39.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So what this paper does is we automatically generate the mask.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1183" target="_blank">00:19:43.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So they simply just type in the new query and get the new image.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1186" target="_blank">00:19:46.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So that sounds actually really impressive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1188" target="_blank">00:19:48.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you read the abstract and you think, um, I don't care about doing that, then you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1194" target="_blank">00:19:54.100</a></span> | <span class="t">can skip the paper, you know, um, or, or look at the results.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1199" target="_blank">00:19:59.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And if the results don't look impressive, then just skip the paper.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1203" target="_blank">00:20:03.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's, that's kind of your first point where we can be like, okay, we're, we're done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1207" target="_blank">00:20:07.220</a></span> | <span class="t">But in this case, this sounds great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1209" target="_blank">00:20:09.300</a></span> | <span class="t">The results look amazing. So I think we should keep going.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1213" target="_blank">00:20:13.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1214" target="_blank">00:20:14.220</a></span> | <span class="t">The chief state of the updating performance, of course.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1216" target="_blank">00:20:16.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Fine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1217" target="_blank">00:20:17.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And we try some, right, whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1220" target="_blank">00:20:20.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1221" target="_blank">00:20:21.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So the introduction to a paper, um, is going to try to give you a sense of, you know, what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1228" target="_blank">00:20:28.500</a></span> | <span class="t">they're trying to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1230" target="_blank">00:20:30.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this first paragraph here is just repeating what we've already read in the abstract and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1235" target="_blank">00:20:35.740</a></span> | <span class="t">repeating what we see in figure one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1237" target="_blank">00:20:37.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's saying that we can take a text query, like a basket of fruits, see the examples.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1243" target="_blank">00:20:43.540</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, fine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1244" target="_blank">00:20:44.540</a></span> | <span class="t">We'll skip through there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1246" target="_blank">00:20:46.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So the key thing about academic papers is that they are full of citations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1253" target="_blank">00:20:53.140</a></span> | <span

citations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1264" target="_blank">00:21:04.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And before you know it,

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1288" target="_blank">00:21:28.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So we kind of know that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

target="_blank">00:32:58.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So it looks like we found it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1980" target="_blank">00:33:00.040</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a vector norm.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1981" target="_blank">00:33:01.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so then you can start looking for these things up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=1984" target="_blank">00:33:04.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So we can say norm or maybe vector norm.</span></div><div class="c"><span

So that's actually the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=2890" target="_blank">00:48:10.780</a></span> | <span class="t">key idea, that's a really cool idea, which is that once you have a diffusion model that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=2897" target="_blank">00:48:17.220</a></span> | <span class="t">trained, you can do inference on it where you tell it the truth about what the thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=2902" target="_blank">00:48:22.100</a></span> | <span class="t">is, and then you can do it again but lie about what the thing is, and in your lying version</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=2908" target="_blank">00:48:28.500</a></span> | <span class="t">it's going to say okay, all the stuff that doesn't match zebra must be noise. And so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=2914" target="_blank">00:48:34.180</a></span> | <span class="t">the difference between the noise prediction when you say hey it's a zebra versus the noise</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=2918" target="_blank">00:48:38.420</a></span> | <span class="t">prediction when you say hey it's a horse will be all the pixels that it says no, these pixels</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=2924" target="_blank">00:48:44.580</a></span> | <span class="t">are not zebra. The rest of it, it's fine, there's nothing particularly about the background</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=2930" target="_blank">00:48:50.140</a></span> | <span class="t">that wouldn't work with a zebra. Okay, so that's step one. So then step two is we take the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=2943" target="_blank">00:49:03.060</a></span> | <span class="t">horse and we add noise to it. Okay, that's this XR thing that we learned about before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=2954" target="_blank">00:49:14.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And then step three, we do decoding conditioned on the text query using the mask to replace</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=2963" target="_blank">00:49:23.700</a></span> | <span class="t">the background with pixel values. So this is like the idea that we heard about before,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=2969" target="_blank">00:49:29.660</a></span> | <span class="t">which is that during the inference time as you do diffusion from this fuzzy horse, what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=2977" target="_blank">00:49:37.100</a></span> | <span class="t">happens is that we do a step of diffusion inference and then all these black pixels</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=2984" target="_blank">00:49:44.920</a></span> | <span class="t">we replace with the noised version of the original. And so we do that multiple times</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=2989" target="_blank">00:49:49.980</a></span> | <span class="t">and so that means that the original pixels in this black area won't get changed. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=2997" target="_blank">00:49:57.820</a></span> | <span class="t">that's why you can see in this picture here and this picture here, the backgrounds all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3001" target="_blank">00:50:01.820</a></span> | <span class="t">the same. And the only thing that's changed is that the horse has been turned into a zebra.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3009" target="_blank">00:50:09.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So this paragraph describes it and then you can see here it gives you a lot more detail.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3017" target="_blank">00:50:17.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And the detail often has all kinds of like little tips about things they tried and things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3022" target="_blank">00:50:22.220</a></span> | <span class="t">they found, which is pretty cool. So I won't read through all that because it says the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3031" target="_blank">00:50:31.780</a></span> | <span class="t">same as what I've already just said. One of the interesting little things they note here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3037" target="_blank">00:50:37.100</a></span> | <span class="t">actually is that this binarized mask, so this difference between the R decoding and the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3044" target="_blank">00:50:44.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Q decoding tends to be a bit bigger than the actual area where the horse is, which you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3050" target="_blank">00:50:50.260</a></span> | <span class="t">can kind of see with these legs, for example. And their point is that they actually say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3053" target="_blank">00:50:53.980</a></span> | <span class="t">that's a good thing because actually often you want to slightly change some of the details</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3058" target="_blank">00:50:58.820</a></span> | <span class="t">around the object. So this is actually fine. All right. So we have a description of what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3067" target="_blank">00:51:07.340</a></span> | <span class="t">the thing is, lots of details there. And then here's the bit that I totally skip, the bit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3072" target="_blank">00:51:12.740</a></span> | <span class="t">called theoretical analysis, where this is the stuff that people really generally just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3077" target="_blank">00:51:17.620</a></span> | <span class="t">add to try to get their papers past review. You have to have fancy math. And so they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3082" target="_blank">00:51:22.660</a></span> | <span class="t">basically proving, you can see what it says here, insight into why this component yields</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3088" target="_blank">00:51:28.980</a></span> | <span class="t">better editing results than other approaches. I'm not sure we particularly care because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3094" target="_blank">00:51:34.420</a></span> | <span class="t">like it makes perfect sense what they're doing. It's intuitive and we can see it works. I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3099" target="_blank">00:51:39.260</a></span> | <span class="t">don't feel like I need it proven to me, so I skip over that. So then they'll show us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3104" target="_blank">00:51:44.300</a></span> | <span class="t">their experiments to tell us what datasets they did the experiments on. And so then,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3111" target="_blank">00:51:51.300</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, they have metrics with names like LP IPS and CS FID.

This is just a version of that. But basically they're trying to score how good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3124" target="_blank">00:52:04.780</a></span> | <span class="t">their generated images.

In our case, we can just say, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3141" target="_blank">00:52:21.140</a></span> | <span class="t">it looks good. I like it. So excellent question in the chat from Mikolaj, which is, so would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3149" target="_blank">00:52:29.540</a></span> | <span class="t">this only work on things that are relatively similar?

If you can't come up with a mask for the change you want, this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3167" target="_blank">00:52:47.580</a></span> | <span class="t">isn't going to work very well on the whole.

So, for example, if you wanted to change it from, you know, a bowl</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3178" target="_blank">00:52:58.980</a></span> | <span class="t">of fruits to a bowl of fruits with a bokeh background or like a bowl of fruits with,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3187" target="_blank">00:53:07.820</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, a purple tinged photo of a bowl of fruit, if you want the whole color to change,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3194" target="_blank">00:53:14.060</a></span> | <span class="t">that's not going to work, right?

For some things, you care about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3218" target="_blank">00:53:38.700</a></span> | <span class="t">the experiments a lot.

And so, and often, for whatever reason,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3230" target="_blank">00:53:50.380</a></span> | <span class="t">I guess, because this is, most people read these electronically, the results often you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3233" target="_blank">00:53:53.820</a></span> | <span class="t">have to zoom into a lot to be able to see whether they're really good. So here's the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3237" target="_blank">00:53:57.420</a></span> | <span class="t">input image.

It does a very good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3272" target="_blank">00:54:32.900</a></span> | <span class="t">job of it. All right. So then there's going to be a conclusion at the end, which I find</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3283" target="_blank">00:54:43.580</a></span> | <span class="t">almost never adds anything on top of what we've already read. And as you can see, it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3288" target="_blank">00:54:48.460</a></span> | <span class="t">very short anyway. Now, quite often the appendices are really interesting. So don't skip over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3299" target="_blank">00:54:59.820</a></span> | <span class="t">them. Often you'll find like more examples of pictures. They might show some examples</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3305" target="_blank">00:55:05.300</a></span> | <span class="t">of pictures that didn't work very well, stuff like that. So it's often well worth looking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3310" target="_blank">00:55:10.380</a></span> | <span class="t">at the appendices. Often some of the most interesting examples are there. And that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3316" target="_blank">00:55:16.900</a></span> | <span class="t">it. All right. So that is, I guess, our first full on paper walkthrough. And it's important</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3324" target="_blank">00:55:24.060</a></span> | <span class="t">to remember, this is not like a carefully chosen paper that we've picked specifically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3330" target="_blank">00:55:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">because you can handle it. Like this is the most interesting paper that came out this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3334" target="_blank">00:55:34.020</a></span> | <span class="t">week. And so, you know, it gives you a sense of what it's really like. And for those of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3343" target="_blank">00:55:43.720</a></span> | <span class="t">you who are, you know, ready to try something that's going to stretch you, see if you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3349" target="_blank">00:55:49.740</a></span> | <span class="t">implement any of this paper. So there are three steps. The first step is kind of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3356" target="_blank">00:55:56.540</a></span> | <span class="t">most interesting one, which is to generate, automatically generate a mask. And the information</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3362" target="_blank">00:56:02.660</a></span> | <span class="t">that you have and the code that's in the lesson nine notebook actually contains everything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3367" target="_blank">00:56:07.340</a></span> | <span class="t">you need to do it. So maybe give it a go. See if you can mask out the area of a horse that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3374" target="_blank">00:56:14.540</a></span> | <span class="t">does not look like a zebra. And that's actually, you know, that's actually useful of itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3379" target="_blank">00:56:19.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Like that's, that's allows you to create segmentation masks automatically. So that's pretty cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3386" target="_blank">00:56:26.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And then if you get that working, then you can go and try and do step two. If you get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3390" target="_blank">00:56:30.980</a></span> | <span class="t">that working, you can try and do step three. And this only came out this week. So I haven't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3396" target="_blank">00:56:36.220</a></span> | <span class="t">really seen, yeah, examples of easy to use interfaces to this. So here's an example of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3403" target="_blank">00:56:43.940</a></span> | <span class="t">a paper that you could be the first person to create a call interface to it. So there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3408" target="_blank">00:56:48.040</a></span> | <span class="t">some, yeah, there's a fun little project. And even if you're watching this a long time after</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3413" target="_blank">00:56:53.660</a></span> | <span class="t">this was released and everybody's been doing this for years, still good homework, I think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3418" target="_blank">00:56:58.540</a></span> | <span class="t">so practice if you can. All right. I think now's a good time to have a 10 minute break.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3432" target="_blank">00:57:12.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'll see you all back here in 10 minutes. Okay. Welcome back. One thing during the break</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3443" target="_blank">00:57:23.900</a></span> | <span class="t">that Diego reminded us about, which I normally describe and I totally forgot about this time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3450" target="_blank">00:57:30.060</a></span> | <span class="t">is detectify, which is another really great way to find symbols you don't know about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3455" target="_blank">00:57:35.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's try it for that expectation. So if you're going to detectify and you draw the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3465" target="_blank">00:57:45.100</a></span> | <span class="t">thing, it doesn't always work fantastically well, but sometimes it works very nicely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3473" target="_blank">00:57:53.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, in this case, not quite. What about the double line thing? It's good to know all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3483" target="_blank">00:58:03.500</a></span> | <span class="t">techniques, I guess. I think it could do this one. I guess part of the problem is there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3495" target="_blank">00:58:15.340</a></span> | <span class="t">so many options that actually, you know, okay, in this case, it wasn't particularly helpful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3500" target="_blank">00:58:20.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And normally it's more helpful than that. I mean, if we use a simple one like Epsilon,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3506" target="_blank">00:58:26.380</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it should be fine. There's a lot of room to improve this app, actually, if anybody's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3510" target="_blank">00:58:30.860</a></span> | <span class="t">interested in a project, I think you could make it, you know, more successful. Okay, that's,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3517" target="_blank">00:58:37.500</a></span> | <span class="t">there you go. Signo sum, that's cool. Anyway, so it's another useful thing to know about,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3521" target="_blank">00:58:41.500</a></span> | <span class="t">just Google for detectify. Okay. So let's move on with our from the foundations now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3532" target="_blank">00:58:52.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we were working on trying to at least get the start of a forward pass of a linear model or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3542" target="_blank">00:59:02.220</a></span> | <span class="t">a simple multi-layer perceptron for MNIST going. And we had successfully created a basic tensor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3551" target="_blank">00:59:11.260</a></span> | <span class="t">We've got some random numbers going. So what we now need to do is we now need to be able to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3559" target="_blank">00:59:19.660</a></span> | <span class="t">multiply these things together, matrix multiplication. So matrix multiplication</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3566" target="_blank">00:59:26.380</a></span> | <span class="t">to remind you, in this case, so we're doing MNIST, right? So we've got,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3578" target="_blank">00:59:38.460</a></span> | <span class="t">I think we're going to use a subset. Let's see. Yeah. Okay. So we're going to create a matrix</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3586" target="_blank">00:59:46.700</a></span> | <span class="t">called M1, which is just the first five digits. So M1 will be the first five digits. So five rows</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3597" target="_blank">00:59:57.340</a></span> | <span class="t">and dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot. And then 780, what was it again? 784 columns,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3609" target="_blank">01:00:09.500</a></span> | <span class="t">784 columns, because it's 28 by 28 pixels. And we flattened it out. So this is our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3617" target="_blank">01:00:17.100</a></span> | <span class="t">first matrix and our matrix multiplication. And then we're going to multiply that by some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3622" target="_blank">01:00:22.780</a></span> | <span class="t">weights. So the weights are going to be 784 by 10 random numbers. So for every one of these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3637" target="_blank">01:00:37.820</a></span> | <span class="t">784 pixels, each one is going to have a weight. So 784 down here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3645" target="_blank">01:00:45.020</a></span> | <span class="t">784 by 10. So this first column, for example, is going to tell us all the weights in order to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3658" target="_blank">01:00:58.700</a></span> | <span class="t">figure out if something's a zero. And the second column will have all the weights in deciding the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3663" target="_blank">01:01:03.180</a></span> | <span class="t">probability of something's a one and so forth, assuming we're just doing a linear model. And so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3667" target="_blank">01:01:07.420</a></span> | <span class="t">then we're going to multiply these two matrices together. So when we multiply matrices together,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3672" target="_blank">01:01:12.940</a></span> | <span class="t">we take row one of matrix one and we take column one of matrix two and we take each</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3684" target="_blank">01:01:24.220</a></span> | <span class="t">one in turn. So we take this one and we take this one, we multiply them together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3688" target="_blank">01:01:28.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we take this one and this one and we multiply them together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3696" target="_blank">01:01:36.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And we do that for every element wise pair and then we add them all up. And that would give us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3706" target="_blank">01:01:46.540</a></span> | <span class="t">the value for the very first cell that would go in here. That's what matrix multiplication is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3721" target="_blank">01:02:01.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so let's go ahead then and create our random numbers for the weights,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3730" target="_blank">01:02:10.780</a></span> | <span class="t">since we're allowed to use random number generators now. And for the bias, we'll just use a bunch of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3735" target="_blank">01:02:15.180</a></span> | <span class="t">zeros to start with. So the bias is just what we're going to add to each one. And so for our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3743" target="_blank">01:02:23.340</a></span> | <span class="t">matrix multiplication, we're going to be doing a little mini batch here. We're going to be doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3746" target="_blank">01:02:26.620</a></span> | <span class="t">five rows of, as we discussed, five rows of, so five images flattened out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3755" target="_blank">01:02:35.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And then multiply by this weights matrix. So here are the shapes, m1 is 5 by 784,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3767" target="_blank">01:02:47.340</a></span> | <span class="t">as we saw, m2 is 784 by 10. Okay, so keep those in mind. So here's a handy thing, m1.shape</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3777" target="_blank">01:02:57.180</a></span> | <span class="t">contains two numbers and I want to pull them out. I want to call the, I'm going to think of that as,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3784" target="_blank">01:03:04.940</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to actually think of this as like a and b rather than m1 and m2. So this is like a and b.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3789" target="_blank">01:03:09.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So the number of rows in a and the number of columns in a, if I say equals m1.shape,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3797" target="_blank">01:03:17.500</a></span> | <span class="t">that will put five in ar and 784 in ac. So you'll probably notice this, I do this a lot,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3803" target="_blank">01:03:23.980</a></span> | <span class="t">this de-structuring, we talked about it last week too. So we can do the same for m2.shape,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3808" target="_blank">01:03:28.300</a></span> | <span class="t">put that into b rows and b columns. And so now if I write out arac and brbc, you can again see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3816" target="_blank">01:03:36.220</a></span> | <span class="t">the same things from the sizes. So that's a good way to kind of give us the stuff we have to loop</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3820" target="_blank">01:03:40.780</a></span> | <span class="t">through. So here's our result. So our resultant tensor, while we're multiplying, we're multiplying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3829" target="_blank">01:03:49.180</a></span> | <span class="t">together all of these 784 things and adding them up. So the resultant tensor is going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3833" target="_blank">01:03:53.900</a></span> | <span class="t">be 5 by 10. And then each thing in here is the result of multiplying and adding 784 pairs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3842" target="_blank">01:04:02.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So the result here is going to start with zeros and there is, this is the result.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3851" target="_blank">01:04:11.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's going to contain ar rows, five rows, and bc columns, 10 columns, 5 comma 10. Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3860" target="_blank">01:04:20.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So now we have to fill that in. And so to do a matrix multiplication,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3864" target="_blank">01:04:24.140</a></span> | <span class="t">we have to first, we have to go through each row, one at a time. And here we have that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3875" target="_blank">01:04:35.260</a></span> | <span class="t">go through each row, one at a time. And then go through each column, one at a time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3882" target="_blank">01:04:42.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we have to go through each pair in that row column, one at a time. So there's going to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3889" target="_blank">01:04:49.500</a></span> | <span class="t">a loop, in a loop, in a loop. So here we're going to loop over each row. And here we're going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3899" target="_blank">01:04:59.420</a></span> | <span class="t">loop over each column. And then here we're going to loop, so each column is C. And then here we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3904" target="_blank">01:05:04.380</a></span> | <span class="t">going to loop over each column of A, which is going to be the same as the number of rows of B,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3912" target="_blank">01:05:12.140</a></span> | <span class="t">which we can see here, ac, 784, br, 784, they're the same. So it wouldn't matter whether we said</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3919" target="_blank">01:05:19.100</a></span> | <span class="t">ac or br. So then our result for that row and that column, we have to add onto it the product of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3932" target="_blank">01:05:32.940</a></span> | <span class="t">ik in the first matrix by kj in the second matrix. So k is going up through those 784. And so we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3942" target="_blank">01:05:42.540</a></span> | <span class="t">going to go across the columns and down, sorry, across the rows and down the columns. It's going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3947" target="_blank">01:05:47.100</a></span> | <span class="t">to go across the row whilst it goes down this column. So here is the world's most naive, slow,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3956" target="_blank">01:05:56.220</a></span> | <span class="t">uninteresting matrix multiplication. And if we run it, okay, it's done something. We have successfully,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3967" target="_blank">01:06:07.580</a></span> | <span class="t">apparently, hopefully successfully, multiplied the matrices M1 and M2. It's a little hard to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3972" target="_blank">01:06:12.860</a></span> | <span class="t">read this, I find, because punch cards used to be 80 columns wide. We still assume screens are 80</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3981" target="_blank">01:06:21.900</a></span> | <span class="t">columns wide. Everything defaults to 80 wide, which is ridiculous. But you can easily change it. So if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3988" target="_blank">01:06:28.620</a></span> | <span class="t">you say set print options, you can choose your own line width. Oh, as you can see, well, we know it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=3996" target="_blank">01:06:36.380</a></span> | <span class="t">five by 10. We did it before. So if we change the line width, okay, that's much easier to read now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4001" target="_blank">01:06:41.260</a></span> | <span class="t">We can see here are the five rows and here are the 10 columns for that matrix multiplication.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4008" target="_blank">01:06:48.780</a></span> | <span class="t">I tend to always put this at the top of my notebooks and you can do the same thing for NumPy as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4013" target="_blank">01:06:53.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So what I like to do, this is really important, is when I'm working on code, particularly numeric</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4028" target="_blank">01:07:08.460</a></span> | <span class="t">code, I like to do it all step by step in Jupyter.

This is just to do five MNIST digits. So that's not going to be great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4098" target="_blank">01:08:18.780</a></span> | <span class="t">We're going to have to speed that up. I'm actually quite surprised at how slow that is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4104" target="_blank">01:08:24.300</a></span> | <span class="t">because there's only 39,200. So we're, you know, if you look at how we've got a loop within a loop</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4110" target="_blank">01:08:30.540</a></span> | <span class="t">within a loop, what's going wrong? A loop within a loop within a loop, it's doing 39,200 of these.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4117" target="_blank">01:08:37.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So Python, yeah, Python, when you're just doing Python, it is it is slow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4122" target="_blank">01:08:42.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So we can't we can't do that. That's why we can't just write Python.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4126" target="_blank">01:08:46.700</a></span> | <span class="t">But there is something that kind of lets us write Python.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4131" target="_blank">01:08:51.180</a></span> | <span class="t">We could instead use number. Number is a system that takes Python and turns it into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4145" target="_blank">01:09:05.980</a></span> | <span class="t">basically into machine code. And it's amazingly easy to do. You can basically take a function</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4153" target="_blank">01:09:13.260</a></span> | <span class="t">and write end it at end it on top. And what it's going to do is it's going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4160" target="_blank">01:09:20.140</a></span> | <span class="t">look the first time you call this function, it's going to compile it down to machine code</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4165" target="_blank">01:09:25.820</a></span> | <span class="t">and it will run much more quickly. So what I've done here is I've taken the innermost loop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4174" target="_blank">01:09:34.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So just looping through and adding up all these.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4180" target="_blank">01:09:40.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So start at zero, go through and add up all those just for two vectors and return it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4188" target="_blank">01:09:48.700</a></span> | <span class="t">This is called a dot product in linear algebra.

It doesn't work with PyTorch. So we're just going to use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4199" target="_blank">01:09:59.740</a></span> | <span class="t">arrays instead of tensors for a moment. Now, have a look at this. If I try to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4204" target="_blank">01:10:04.540</a></span> | <span class="t">do a dot product of one, two, three and two, three, four, that's pretty easy to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4209" target="_blank">01:10:09.820</a></span> | <span class="t">It took a fifth of a second, which sounds terrible. But the reason it took a fifth of a second is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4217" target="_blank">01:10:17.260</a></span> | <span class="t">because that's actually how long it took to compile this and run it. Now that it's compiled,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4221" target="_blank">01:10:21.900</a></span> | <span class="t">the second time it just has to call it, it's now 21 microseconds. And so that's actually very fast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4231" target="_blank">01:10:31.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So with number, we can basically make Python run at C speed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4238" target="_blank">01:10:38.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So now the important thing to recognize is if I replace this loop in Python with a call to dot,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4249" target="_blank">01:10:49.980</a></span> | <span class="t">which is running in machine code, then we now have one, two loops running in Python, not three.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4260" target="_blank">01:11:00.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So our 448 milliseconds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4263" target="_blank">01:11:03.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, first of all, let's make sure if I run it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4268" target="_blank">01:11:08.220</a></span> | <span class="t">run that matmul, it should be close to my T1. T1 is what we got before, remember?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4280" target="_blank">01:11:20.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So when I'm refactoring or performance improving or whatever, I always like to put every step</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4286" target="_blank">01:11:26.780</a></span> | <span class="t">in the notebook and then test. So this test close comes from fastcore.test. And it just checks that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4293" target="_blank">01:11:33.420</a></span> | <span class="t">two things are very similar. They might not be exactly the same because of little floating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4297" target="_blank">01:11:37.340</a></span> | <span class="t">point differences, which is fine. OK, so our matmul is working correctly, or at least it's doing the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4302" target="_blank">01:11:42.220</a></span> | <span class="t">same thing it did before. So if we now run it, it's taking 268 microseconds versus 448 milliseconds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4313" target="_blank">01:11:53.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's taking, you know, about 2000 times faster just by changing the one in a most loop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4323" target="_blank">01:12:03.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So really, all we've done is we've added @engit to make it 2000 times faster.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4328" target="_blank">01:12:08.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So number is well worth knowing about.

So we're going to use stuff again, which kind of goes back to APL.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4346" target="_blank">01:12:26.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And a lot of people say that learning APL is a thing that's taught them more about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4353" target="_blank">01:12:33.020</a></span> | <span class="t">programming than anything else.

Now, the prefix is the backtick character.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4454" target="_blank">01:14:14.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So here it's saying prefix hyphen gives us times. So type a backtick dash b is a times b,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4465" target="_blank">01:14:25.580</a></span> | <span class="t">for example. So yeah, they all have shortcut keys, which you learn pretty quickly, I find.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4473" target="_blank">01:14:33.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's a fairly consistent kind of system for those shortcut keys, too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4476" target="_blank">01:14:36.940</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. So we can do the same thing in PyTorch. It's a little bit more verbose in PyTorch,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4483" target="_blank">01:14:43.740</a></span> | <span class="t">which is one reason I often like to do my mathematical fiddling around in APL. I can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4488" target="_blank">01:14:48.540</a></span> | <span class="t">often do it with less boilerplate, which means I can spend more time thinking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4494" target="_blank">01:14:54.460</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I can see everything on the screen at once. I don't have to spend as much time trying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4498" target="_blank">01:14:58.300</a></span> | <span class="t">to ignore the tensor, round brackets, square bracket dot comma, blah, blah, blah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4503" target="_blank">01:15:03.100</a></span> | <span class="t">It's all cognitive load, which I'd rather ignore. But anyway, it does the same thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4507" target="_blank">01:15:07.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So I can say a plus b and it works exactly like APL.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4510" target="_blank">01:15:10.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So here's an interesting example. I can go a less than b dot float dot mean.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4518" target="_blank">01:15:18.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's try that one over here. A less than b. So this is a really important idea,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4525" target="_blank">01:15:25.020</a></span> | <span class="t">which I think was invented by Ken Iverson, the APL guy, which is the true and false</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4530" target="_blank">01:15:30.460</a></span> | <span class="t">represented by zero and one. And because they're represented by zero and one, we can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4537" target="_blank">01:15:37.100</a></span> | <span class="t">do things to them. We can add them up and subtract them and so forth. It's a really important idea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4543" target="_blank">01:15:43.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So in this case, I want to take the mean of them. And I'm going to tell you something amazing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4551" target="_blank">01:15:51.740</a></span> | <span class="t">which is that in APL, there is no function called mean. Why not? That's because we can write</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4559" target="_blank">01:15:59.580</a></span> | <span class="t">the main function, which is so that's four letters, mean, M-E-A-N. We can write the main</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4565" target="_blank">01:16:05.820</a></span> | <span class="t">function from scratch with four characters. I'll show you. Here's the whole main function.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4572" target="_blank">01:16:12.700</a></span> | <span class="t">We're going to create a function called main and the main is equal to the sum of a list</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4580" target="_blank">01:16:20.940</a></span> | <span class="t">divided by the count of a list. So this here is sum divided by count.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4587" target="_blank">01:16:27.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I've now defined a new function called mean, which calculates the mean.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4593" target="_blank">01:16:33.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Mean of a is less than b. There we go. And so, you know, in practice, I'm not sure people would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4601" target="_blank">01:16:41.020</a></span> | <span class="t">even bother defining a function called mean because it's just as easy to actually write</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4605" target="_blank">01:16:45.100</a></span> | <span class="t">its implementation in APL, in NumPy or whatever Python, it's going to take a lot more than four</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4612" target="_blank">01:16:52.620</a></span> | <span class="t">letters to implement mean. So anyway, you know, it's a math notation. And so being a math notation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4618" target="_blank">01:16:58.060</a></span> | <span class="t">we can do a lot with little, which I find helpful because I can see everything going on at once.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4623" target="_blank">01:17:03.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Anywho, OK, so that's how we do the same thing in PyTorch. And again, you can see that the less than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4630" target="_blank">01:17:10.460</a></span> | <span class="t">in both cases are operating element wise. OK, so a is less than b is saying ten is less than two,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4635" target="_blank">01:17:15.900</a></span> | <span class="t">six is less than eight, four is less than seven and gives us back each of those trues and falses</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4640" target="_blank">01:17:20.620</a></span> | <span class="t">as zeros and ones. And according to the emoji on our YouTube chat, see if his head just exploded</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4646" target="_blank">01:17:26.460</a></span> | <span class="t">as it should. This is why APL is, yeah, life changing. OK, let's now go up to higher ranks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4656" target="_blank">01:17:36.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So this here is a rank one tensor. So a rank one tensor means it's a it's a list of things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4664" target="_blank">01:17:44.460</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a vector. It's where else a rank two tensor is like a list of lists. They all have to be the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4671" target="_blank">01:17:51.900</a></span> | <span class="t">same length lists or it's like a rectangular bunch of numbers. And we call it in math, we call it a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4676" target="_blank">01:17:56.540</a></span> | <span class="t">matrix. So this is how we can create a tensor containing one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4681" target="_blank">01:18:01.740</a></span> | <span class="t">eight, nine. And you can see often what I like to do is I want to print out the thing I just created</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4689" target="_blank">01:18:09.660</a></span> | <span class="t">after I created it. So two ways to do it. You can say, put an enter and then write M and that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4695" target="_blank">01:18:15.900</a></span> | <span class="t">going to do that. Or if you want to put it all on the same line, that works too. You just use a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4699" target="_blank">01:18:19.180</a></span> | <span class="t">semicolon. Neither one's better than the other. They're just different. So we could do the same</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4706" target="_blank">01:18:26.140</a></span> | <span class="t">thing in APL. Of course, in APL, it's going to be much easier. So we're going to define a matrix</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4712" target="_blank">01:18:32.540</a></span> | <span class="t">called M, which is going to be a three by three tensor containing the numbers from one to nine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4723" target="_blank">01:18:43.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. And there we go. That's done it in APL. A three by three tensor containing the numbers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4734" target="_blank">01:18:54.540</a></span> | <span class="t">from one to nine. A lot of these ideas from APL you'll find have made their way into other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4739" target="_blank">01:18:59.500</a></span> | <span class="t">programming languages. For example, if you use Go, you might recognize this. This is the iota</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4744" target="_blank">01:19:04.700</a></span> | <span class="t">character and Go uses the word iota. So they spell it out in a somewhat similar way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4751" target="_blank">01:19:11.180</a></span> | <span class="t">A lot of these ideas from APL have found themselves into math notation and other languages.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4759" target="_blank">01:19:19.340</a></span> | <span class="t">It's been around since the late 50s. Okay. So here's a bit of fun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4764" target="_blank">01:19:24.060</a></span> | <span class="t">We're going to learn about a new thing that looks kind of crazy called Frobenius norm.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4770" target="_blank">01:19:30.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And we'll use that from time to time as we're doing generative modeling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4775" target="_blank">01:19:35.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And here's the definition of a Frobenius norm. It's the sum over all of the rows and columns</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4783" target="_blank">01:19:43.900</a></span> | <span class="t">of a matrix. And we're going to take each one and square it. We're going to add them up and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4791" target="_blank">01:19:51.980</a></span> | <span class="t">they're going to take the square root. And so to implement that in PyTorch is as simple as going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4800" target="_blank">01:20:00.140</a></span> | <span class="t">n times m dot sum dot square root. So this looks like a pretty complicated thing when you kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4810" target="_blank">01:20:10.380</a></span> | <span class="t">look at it at first. It looks like a lot of squiggly business. Or if you said this thing here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4814" target="_blank">01:20:14.540</a></span> | <span class="t">you might be like, what on earth is that? Well, now, you know, it's just square sum square root.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4821" target="_blank">01:20:21.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, we could do the same thing in APL.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4825" target="_blank">01:20:25.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's do, so in APL, we want the, okay, so we're going to create something called SF.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4836" target="_blank">01:20:36.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, it's interesting, APL does this a little bit differently. So dot sum by default in PyTorch sums</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4844" target="_blank">01:20:44.220</a></span> | <span class="t">over everything. And if you want to sum over just one dimension, you have to pass in a dimension</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4848" target="_blank">01:20:48.540</a></span> | <span class="t">keyword. For very good reasons, APL is the opposite. It just sums across rows or just down columns.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4855" target="_blank">01:20:55.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So actually, we have to say sum up the flattened out version of the matrix. And to say flattened</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4862" target="_blank">01:21:02.620</a></span> | <span class="t">out, use comma. So here's sum up the flattened out version of the matrix. Okay, so that's our SF.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4872" target="_blank">01:21:12.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, sorry. And the matrix is meant to be m times m. There we go. So there's the same thing. Sum up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4884" target="_blank">01:21:24.220</a></span> | <span class="t">the flattened out m by m matrix. And another interesting thing about APL is it always is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4889" target="_blank">01:21:29.100</a></span> | <span class="t">read right to left. There's no such thing as operator precedence, which makes life a lot easier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4894" target="_blank">01:21:34.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, and then we take the square root of that. There isn't a square root function.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4902" target="_blank">01:21:42.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have to do to the power of 0.5. And there we go. Same thing. All right, you get the idea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4911" target="_blank">01:21:51.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, a very interesting question here from Marabou. Are the bars for norm or absolute value?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4918" target="_blank">01:21:58.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And I like Siva's answer, which is the norm is the same as the absolute value for a scalar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4925" target="_blank">01:22:05.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So in this case, you can think of it as absolute value. And it's kind of not needed because it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4930" target="_blank">01:22:10.380</a></span> | <span class="t">being squared anyway. But yes, in this case, the norm, well, in every case for a scalar,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4937" target="_blank">01:22:17.340</a></span> | <span class="t">the norm is the absolute value, which is kind of a cute discovery when you realize it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4941" target="_blank">01:22:21.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So thank you for pointing that out, Siva. All right. So this is just fiddling around a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4948" target="_blank">01:22:28.380</a></span> | <span class="t">bit to kind of get a sense of how these things work. So really importantly, you can index into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4956" target="_blank">01:22:36.780</a></span> | <span class="t">a matrix and you'll say rows first and then columns. And if you say colon, it means all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4963" target="_blank">01:22:43.500</a></span> | <span class="t">columns. So if I say row two, here it is, row two, all the columns, sorry, this is row two,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4971" target="_blank">01:22:51.420</a></span> | <span class="t">so that's at zero, APL starts at one, all the columns, that's going to be seven, eight, nine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4977" target="_blank">01:22:57.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can see I often use comma to print out multiple things.

And so this is just a quick way of printing out the second row.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4987" target="_blank">01:23:07.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And then here, every row, column two. So here is every row of column two. And here you can see three,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=4996" target="_blank">01:23:16.300</a></span> | <span class="t">six, nine. So one thing very useful to recognize is that for tensors of higher rank than one,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5010" target="_blank">01:23:30.460</a></span> | <span class="t">such as a matrix, any trailing colons are optional. So you see this here, M2, that's the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5017" target="_blank">01:23:37.900</a></span> | <span class="t">same as M2 comma colon. It's really important to remember. Okay, so M2, you can see the result is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5024" target="_blank">01:23:44.540</a></span> | <span class="t">the same. So that means row two, every column. Okay, so now with all that in place, we've got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5035" target="_blank">01:23:55.340</a></span> | <span class="t">quite an easy way. We don't need a number anymore. We can multiply, so we can get rid of that inner</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5043" target="_blank">01:24:03.260</a></span> | <span class="t">most loop. So we're going to get rid of this loop, because this is just multiplying together all of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5049" target="_blank">01:24:09.660</a></span> | <span class="t">the corresponding rows of A with the, sorry, all the corresponding columns of a row of A with all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5056" target="_blank">01:24:16.380</a></span> | <span class="t">the corresponding rows of a column of B. And so we can just use an element-wise operation for that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5062" target="_blank">01:24:22.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So here is the ith row of A, and here is the jth column of B. And so those are both, as we've seen,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5075" target="_blank">01:24:35.980</a></span> | <span class="t">just vectors, and therefore we can do an element-wise multiplication of them,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5080" target="_blank">01:24:40.300</a></span> | <span class="t">and then sum them up. And that's the same as a dot product. So that's handy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5086" target="_blank">01:24:46.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And so again, we'll do test close. Okay, it's the same. Great. And again, you'll see we kind of did</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5095" target="_blank">01:24:55.180</a></span> | <span class="t">all of our experimenting first, right, to make sure that we understood how it all worked,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5099" target="_blank">01:24:59.580</a></span> | <span class="t">and then put it together. And then if we time it, 661 microseconds. Okay, so it's interesting. It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5106" target="_blank">01:25:06.940</a></span> | <span class="t">actually slower than, which really shows you how good number is, but it's certainly a hell of a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5112" target="_blank">01:25:12.220</a></span> | <span class="t">better than our 450 milliseconds. But we're using something that's kind of a lot more general now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5118" target="_blank">01:25:18.620</a></span> | <span class="t">This is exactly the same as dot, as we've discussed. So we could just use torch dot,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5127" target="_blank">01:25:27.260</a></span> | <span class="t">torch dot dot, I suppose I should say. And if we run that, okay, a little faster. It's still,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5134" target="_blank">01:25:34.300</a></span> | <span class="t">interestingly, it's still slower than the number, which is quite amazing, actually.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5139" target="_blank">01:25:39.660</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, so that one was not exactly a speed up, but it's kind of a bit more general, which is nice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5147" target="_blank">01:25:47.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Now we're going to get something into something really fun,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5154" target="_blank">01:25:54.780</a></span> | <span class="t">which is broadcasting. And broadcasting is about what if you have arrays with different shapes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5160" target="_blank">01:26:00.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So what's a shape? The shape is the number of rows, or the number of rows and columns,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5166" target="_blank">01:26:06.140</a></span> | <span class="t">or the number of, what would you say, faces, rows and columns, and so forth. So for example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5173" target="_blank">01:26:13.420</a></span> | <span class="t">the shape of M is 3 by 3. So what happens if you multiply, or add, or do operations to tensors of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5182" target="_blank">01:26:22.220</a></span> | <span class="t">different shapes? Well, there's one very simple one, which is if you've got a rank one tensor,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5189" target="_blank">01:26:29.180</a></span> | <span class="t">the vector, then you can use any operation with a scalar, and it broadcasts that scalar</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5199" target="_blank">01:26:39.740</a></span> | <span class="t">across the tensor. So a is greater than zero is exactly the same as saying a is greater than tensor</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5207" target="_blank">01:26:47.420</a></span> | <span class="t">zero comma zero comma zero. So it's basically copying that across three times. Now it's not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5218" target="_blank">01:26:58.860</a></span> | <span class="t">literally making a copy in memory, but it's acting as if we had said that. And this is the most</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5223" target="_blank">01:27:03.820</a></span> | <span class="t">simple version of broadcasting. Okay, it's broadcasting the zero across the ten, and the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5229" target="_blank">01:27:09.900</a></span> | <span class="t">six, and the negative four. And APL does exactly the same thing. a is less than five, so zero, zero,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5242" target="_blank">01:27:22.620</a></span> | <span class="t">one. So same idea. Okay. So we can do plus with a scalar, and we can do exactly the same thing with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5261" target="_blank">01:27:41.580</a></span> | <span class="t">higher than rank one. So two times a matrix is just going to do two is going to be broadcast</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5267" target="_blank">01:27:47.420</a></span> | <span class="t">across all the rows and all the columns. Okay, now it gets interesting. So broadcasting dates back to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5279" target="_blank">01:27:59.180</a></span> | <span class="t">APL. But a really interesting idea is that we can broadcast not just scalars, but we can broadcast</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5285" target="_blank">01:28:05.820</a></span> | <span class="t">vectors across matrices or broadcast any kind of lower ranked tensor across higher ranked tensors,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5293" target="_blank">01:28:13.740</a></span> | <span class="t">or even broadcast together together two tensors of the same rank, but different shapes in a really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5300" target="_blank">01:28:20.460</a></span> | <span class="t">powerful way. And as I was exploring this, I was trying to love doing this kind of computer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5307" target="_blank">01:28:27.340</a></span> | <span class="t">archaeology. I was trying to find out where the hell this comes from. And it actually turns out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5311" target="_blank">01:28:31.660</a></span> | <span class="t">from this email message in 1995, that the idea actually comes from a language that I'd never</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5321" target="_blank">01:28:41.100</a></span> | <span class="t">heard of called Yorick, which still apparently exists. Here's Yorick. And so Yorick has talks about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5331" target="_blank">01:28:51.740</a></span> | <span class="t">broadcasting and conformability. So what happened is this very obscure language</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5341" target="_blank">01:29:01.740</a></span> | <span class="t">has this very powerful idea. And NumPy has happily stolen the idea from Yorick that allows us to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5351" target="_blank">01:29:11.820</a></span> | <span class="t">broadcast together tensors that don't appear to match. So let me give an example. Here's a tensor</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5360" target="_blank">01:29:20.060</a></span> | <span class="t">called C that's a vector. It's a rank one tensor, 10, 20, 30. And here's a tensor called M, which is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5366" target="_blank">01:29:26.540</a></span> | <span class="t">a matrix. We've seen this one before. And one of them is shape three, comma, three. The other is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5372" target="_blank">01:29:32.860</a></span> | <span class="t">shape three. And yet we can add them together. Now what's happened when we added it together?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5381" target="_blank">01:29:41.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, what's happened is 10, 20, 30 got added to one, two, three. And then 10, 20, 30 got added to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5390" target="_blank">01:29:50.700</a></span> | <span class="t">four, five, six. And then 10, 20, 30 got added to seven, eight, nine. And hopefully you can see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5398" target="_blank">01:29:58.780</a></span> | <span class="t">this looks quite familiar. Instead of broadcasting a scalar over a higher rank tensor,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5405" target="_blank">01:30:05.340</a></span> | <span class="t">this is broadcasting a vector across every row of a matrix.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5415" target="_blank">01:30:15.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And it works both ways. So we can say C plus M gives us exactly the same thing. And so let me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5421" target="_blank">01:30:21.180</a></span> | <span class="t">explain what's actually happening here. The trick is to know about this somewhat obscure method called</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5426" target="_blank">01:30:26.780</a></span> | <span class="t">expand as. And what expand as does is this creates a new thing called T, which contains exactly the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5433" target="_blank">01:30:33.420</a></span> | <span class="t">same thing as C, but expanded or kind of copied over. So it has the same shape as M. So here's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5440" target="_blank">01:30:40.700</a></span> | <span class="t">what T looks like. Now T contains exactly the same thing as C does, but it's got three copies of it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5447" target="_blank">01:30:47.500</a></span> | <span class="t">now. And you can see we can definitely add T to M because they match shapes. Right? So we can say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5456" target="_blank">01:30:56.380</a></span> | <span class="t">M plus T. We know we can play M plus T because we've already learned that you can do element-wise</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5461" target="_blank">01:31:01.900</a></span> | <span class="t">operations on two things that have matching shapes. Now, by the way, this thing T didn't actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5469" target="_blank">01:31:09.740</a></span> | <span class="t">create three copies. Check this out. If we call T dot storage, it tells us what's actually in memory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5475" target="_blank">01:31:15.580</a></span> | <span class="t">It actually just contains the numbers 10, 20, 30. But it does a really clever trick. It has a stride</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5483" target="_blank">01:31:23.020</a></span> | <span class="t">of zero across the rows and a size of three comma three. And so what that means is that it acts as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5490" target="_blank">01:31:30.700</a></span> | <span class="t">if it's a three by three matrix. And each time it goes to the next row, it actually stays exactly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5496" target="_blank">01:31:36.540</a></span> | <span class="t">where it is. And this idea of strides is the trick which NumPy and PyTorch and so forth use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5505" target="_blank">01:31:45.180</a></span> | <span class="t">for all kinds of things where you basically can create very efficient ways to do things like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5512" target="_blank">01:31:52.860</a></span> | <span class="t">expanding or to kind of jump over things and stuff like that, you know, switch between columns and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5518" target="_blank">01:31:58.540</a></span> | <span class="t">rows, stuff like that. Anyway, the important thing here for us to recognize is that we didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5523" target="_blank">01:32:03.100</a></span> | <span class="t">actually make a copy. This is totally efficient and it's all going to be run in C code very fast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5527" target="_blank">01:32:07.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So remember, this expand as is critical. This is the thing that will teach you to understand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5534" target="_blank">01:32:14.140</a></span> | <span class="t">how broadcasting works, which is really important for implementing deep learning algorithms or any</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5539" target="_blank">01:32:19.980</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of linear algebra on any Python system, because the NumPy rules are used exactly the same</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5548" target="_blank">01:32:28.460</a></span> | <span class="t">in JAX, in TensorFlow, in PyTorch and so forth. Now I'll show you a little trick,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5556" target="_blank">01:32:36.540</a></span> | <span class="t">which is going to be very important in a moment. If we take C, which remember is a vector containing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5564" target="_blank">01:32:44.060</a></span> | <span class="t">10 20 30, and we say dot unsqueezed zero, then it changes the shape from three to one comma three.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5575" target="_blank">01:32:55.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So it changes it from a vector of length three to a matrix of one row by three columns. This will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5582" target="_blank">01:33:02.860</a></span> | <span class="t">turn out to be very important in a moment. And you can see how it's printed. It's printed out with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5586" target="_blank">01:33:06.540</a></span> | <span class="t">two square brackets. Now I never use unsqueezed because I much prefer doing something more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5592" target="_blank">01:33:12.220</a></span> | <span class="t">flexible, which is if you index into an axis with a special value none, also known as np.newaxis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5600" target="_blank">01:33:20.300</a></span> | <span class="t">It does exactly the same thing. It inserts a new axis here. So here we'll get exactly the same thing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5608" target="_blank">01:33:28.540</a></span> | <span class="t">one row by all the columns, three columns. So this is exactly the same as saying unsqueezed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5615" target="_blank">01:33:35.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So this inserts a new unit axis. This is a unit axis, a single row</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5625" target="_blank">01:33:45.100</a></span> | <span class="t">in this dimension. And this does the same thing. So these are the same. So we could do the same</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5632" target="_blank">01:33:52.460</a></span> | <span class="t">thing and say unsqueeze one, which means now we're going to unsqueeze into the first dimension.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5639" target="_blank">01:33:59.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So that means we now have three rows and one column. See the shape here? The shape is inserting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5648" target="_blank">01:34:08.620</a></span> | <span class="t">a unit axis in position one, three rows and one column. And so we can do exactly the same thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5656" target="_blank">01:34:16.940</a></span> | <span class="t">here. Give us every row and a new unit axis in position one. Same thing. Okay. So those two are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5665" target="_blank">01:34:25.020</a></span> | <span class="t">exactly the same. So this is how we create a matrix with one row. This is how we create a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5675" target="_blank">01:34:35.180</a></span> | <span class="t">matrix with one column. None comma colon versus colon comma none or unsqueeze.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5681" target="_blank">01:34:41.900</a></span> | <span class="t">We don't have to say, as we've learned before, none comma colon, because do you remember?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5691" target="_blank">01:34:51.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Trailing columns are optional. So therefore just see none is also going to give you a row matrix,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5699" target="_blank">01:34:59.660</a></span> | <span class="t">one row matrix. This is a little trick here. If you say dot, dot, dot, that means all of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5706" target="_blank">01:35:06.940</a></span> | <span class="t">dimensions. And so dot, dot, dot comma none will always insert a unit axis at the end, regardless</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5713" target="_blank">01:35:13.500</a></span> | <span class="t">of what rank a tensor is. So, yeah, so none and NP new axis mean exactly the same thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5721" target="_blank">01:35:21.020</a></span> | <span class="t">NP new axis is actually a synonym for none. If you've ever used that, I always use none</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5729" target="_blank">01:35:29.260</a></span> | <span class="t">because why not? It's short and simple. So here's something interesting. If we go C colon,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5734" target="_blank">01:35:34.860</a></span> | <span class="t">common none, so let's go and check out what C colon, common none looks like. C colon, common none</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5742" target="_blank">01:35:42.540</a></span> | <span class="t">is a column. And if we say expand as M, which is three by three, then it's going to take that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5751" target="_blank">01:35:51.580</a></span> | <span class="t">10, 20, 30 column and replicate it 10, 20, 30, 10, 20, 30, 10, 20, 30. So we could add. So remember,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5760" target="_blank">01:36:00.860</a></span> | <span class="t">like, remember, I will explain that when you say matrix plus C colon, common none,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5770" target="_blank">01:36:10.620</a></span> | <span class="t">it's basically going to do this dot expand as for you. So if I want to add this matrix here to M,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5780" target="_blank">01:36:20.380</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't need to say dot expand as I just write this. I just write M plus C colon, common none.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5787" target="_blank">01:36:27.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this is exactly the same as doing M plus C. But now rather than adding the vector to each row,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5796" target="_blank">01:36:36.060</a></span> | <span class="t">it's adding the vector to each column C plus 10, 20, 30, 10, 20, 30, 10, 20, 30.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5805" target="_blank">01:36:45.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's a really simple way that we now get kind of for free thanks to this really nifty notation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5811" target="_blank">01:36:51.420</a></span> | <span class="t">this nisti approach that that came from Yorick. So here you can see M plus C none,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5818" target="_blank">01:36:58.460</a></span> | <span class="t">none, colon is adding 10, 20, 30 to each row. And M plus C colon, common none is adding 10,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5826" target="_blank">01:37:06.060</a></span> | <span class="t">20, 30 to each column. All right, so that's the basic like hand wavy version. So let's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5835" target="_blank">01:37:15.180</a></span> | <span class="t">look at like what are the rules? How does it work? Okay, so C none, colon is one by three.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5843" target="_blank">01:37:23.500</a></span> | <span class="t">C colon, common none is three by one. What happens if we multiply C none, colon</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5851" target="_blank">01:37:31.980</a></span> | <span class="t">by C colon, common none? Well, it's going to do if you think about it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5857" target="_blank">01:37:37.820</a></span> | <span class="t">which you definitely should because thinking is very helpful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5864" target="_blank">01:37:44.620</a></span> | <span class="t">What is going on here? Oh, it took forever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5866" target="_blank">01:37:46.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so what happens if we go C none, colon times C colon, common none? So what it's going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5875" target="_blank">01:37:55.020</a></span> | <span class="t">to have to do is it's going to have to take this 10, 20, 30 column vector or three by one matrix</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5884" target="_blank">01:38:04.460</a></span> | <span class="t">and it's going to have to make it work across each of these rows. So what it does is expands it to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5892" target="_blank">01:38:12.300</a></span> | <span class="t">10, 20, 30, 10, 20, 30, 10, 20, 30. So it's going to do it just like this. And then it's going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5898" target="_blank">01:38:18.940</a></span> | <span class="t">do the same thing for C none, colon. So that's going to become three rows of 10, 20, 30. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5906" target="_blank">01:38:26.460</a></span> | <span class="t">we're going to end up with three rows of 10, 20, 30 times three columns of 10, 20, 30,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5913" target="_blank">01:38:33.660</a></span> | <span class="t">which gives us our answer. And so this is going to do an outer product. So it's very nifty that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5923" target="_blank">01:38:43.020</a></span> | <span class="t">you can actually do an outer product without any special, you know, functions or anything,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5930" target="_blank">01:38:50.620</a></span> | <span class="t">just using broadcasting. And it's not just outer products, you can do outer Boolean operations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5936" target="_blank">01:38:56.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And this kind of stuff comes up all the time, right? Now, remember, you don't need the comma</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5940" target="_blank">01:39:00.940</a></span> | <span class="t">colon, so get rid of it. So this is showing us all the places where it's greater than it's kind of an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5949" target="_blank">01:39:09.820</a></span> | <span class="t">outer, an outer Boolean, if you want to call it that. So this is super nifty and you can do all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5956" target="_blank">01:39:16.540</a></span> | <span class="t">kinds of tricks with this because it runs very, very fast. So this is going to be accelerated in C.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5961" target="_blank">01:39:21.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So here are the rules. Okay. When you operate on two arrays or tensors, NumPy and PyTorch will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5969" target="_blank">01:39:29.180</a></span> | <span class="t">compare their shapes. Okay. So remember the shape, this is a shape. You can tell it's a shape because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5974" target="_blank">01:39:34.620</a></span> | <span class="t">we said shape and it goes from right to left. So that's the trailing dimensions. And it checks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5982" target="_blank">01:39:42.300</a></span> | <span class="t">whether the dimensions are compatible. Now they're compatible if they're equal, right? So for example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=5988" target="_blank">01:39:48.460</a></span> | <span class="t">if we say M times M, then those two shapes are compatible because in each case, it's just going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6004" target="_blank">01:40:04.220</a></span> | <span class="t">to be three, right? So they're going to be equal. So if the shape in that dimension is equal,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6011" target="_blank">01:40:11.580</a></span> | <span class="t">they're compatible, or if one of them is one and if one of them is one, then that dimension is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6018" target="_blank">01:40:18.540</a></span> | <span class="t">broadcast to make it the same size as the other. So that's why the outer product worked. We had</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6028" target="_blank">01:40:28.540</a></span> | <span class="t">a one by three times a three by one. And so this one got copied three times to make it this long.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6037" target="_blank">01:40:37.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And this one got copied three times to make it this long. Okay. So those are the rules. So the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6046" target="_blank">01:40:46.860</a></span> | <span class="t">arrays don't have to have the same number of dimensions. So this is an example that comes up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6051" target="_blank">01:40:51.900</a></span> | <span class="t">all the time. Let's say you've got a 256 by 256 by three array or tensor of RGB values. So you've got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6057" target="_blank">01:40:57.500</a></span> | <span class="t">an image, in other words, a color image. And you want to normalize it. So you want to scale each</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6063" target="_blank">01:41:03.740</a></span> | <span class="t">color in the image by a different value. So this is how we normalize colors. So one way is you could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6074" target="_blank">01:41:14.220</a></span> | <span class="t">multiply or divide or whatever, multiply the image by a one-dimensional array with three values.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6080" target="_blank">01:41:20.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So you've got a 1D array. So that's just three. Okay. And then the image is 256 by 256 by three.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6090" target="_blank">01:41:30.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And we go right to left and we check, are they the same? And we say, yes, they are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6095" target="_blank">01:41:35.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we keep going left and we say, are they the same? And if it's missing, we act as if it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6101" target="_blank">01:41:41.660</a></span> | <span class="t">one. And if we go, keep going, if it's missing, we act as if it's one. So this is going to be the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6106" target="_blank">01:41:46.940</a></span> | <span class="t">same as doing one by one by three. And so this is going to be broadcast. This three, three</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6112" target="_blank">01:41:52.940</a></span> | <span class="t">elements will be broadcast over all 256 by 256 pixels. So this is a super fast</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6120" target="_blank">01:42:00.540</a></span> | <span class="t">and convenient and nice way of normalizing image data with a single expression. And this is exactly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6126" target="_blank">01:42:06.620</a></span> | <span class="t">how we do it in the fast.ai library. In fact, so we can use this to dramatically speed up our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6135" target="_blank">01:42:15.020</a></span> | <span class="t">matrix multiplication. Let's just grab a single digit just for simplicity. And I really like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6141" target="_blank">01:42:21.340</a></span> | <span class="t">doing this in Jupyter notebooks. And if you, if you build Jupyter notebooks to explain stuff that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6146" target="_blank">01:42:26.780</a></span> | <span class="t">you've learned in this course or ways that you can apply it, consider doing this for your readers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6151" target="_blank">01:42:31.020</a></span> | <span class="t">but add a lot more prose. I haven't added prose here because I want to use my voice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6156" target="_blank">01:42:36.460</a></span> | <span class="t">If I was, for example, in our book that we published, it's all written in notebooks and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6162" target="_blank">01:42:42.700</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a lot more prose, obviously. But like really, I like to show every example all along</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6167" target="_blank">01:42:47.740</a></span> | <span class="t">the way using simple as possible. So let's just grab a single digit. So here's the first digit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6174" target="_blank">01:42:54.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So its shape is, it's a 784 long vector. And remember that our weight matrix is 784 by 10.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6182" target="_blank">01:43:02.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So if we say digit colon common none dot shape, then that is a 784 by 1 row matrix. So there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6198" target="_blank">01:43:18.460</a></span> | <span class="t">our matrix. And so if we then take that 784 by 1 and expand as M2, it's going to be the same</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6210" target="_blank">01:43:30.060</a></span> | <span class="t">shape as our weight matrix. So it's copied our image data for that digit across all of the 10</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6222" target="_blank">01:43:42.060</a></span> | <span class="t">vectors representing the 10 linear projections we're doing for our linear model. And so that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6230" target="_blank">01:43:50.620</a></span> | <span class="t">means that we can take the digit colon common none, so 784 by 1, and multiply it by the weights.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6237" target="_blank">01:43:57.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's going to get us back 784 by 10. And so what it's doing, remember, is it's basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6243" target="_blank">01:44:03.820</a></span> | <span class="t">looping through each of these 10 784 long vectors. And for each one of them, it's multiplying it by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6253" target="_blank">01:44:13.900</a></span> | <span class="t">this digit. So that's exactly what we want to do in our matrix multiplication. So originally,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6263" target="_blank">01:44:23.340</a></span> | <span class="t">we had, well not originally, most recently I should say, we had this dot product where we were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6271" target="_blank">01:44:31.740</a></span> | <span class="t">actually looping over j, which was the columns of b. So we don't have to do that anymore,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6280" target="_blank">01:44:40.540</a></span> | <span class="t">because we can do it all at once by doing exactly what we just did. So we can take the i-th row</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6288" target="_blank">01:44:48.780</a></span> | <span class="t">and all the columns and add a axis to the end. And then just like we did here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6301" target="_blank">01:45:01.100</a></span> | <span class="t">multiply it by b. And then dot sum. And so that is, again, exactly the same thing. That is another</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6310" target="_blank">01:45:10.780</a></span> | <span class="t">matrix multiplication, doing it using broadcasting. Now this is like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6315" target="_blank">01:45:15.660</a></span> | <span class="t">tricky to get your head around. And so if you haven't done this kind of broadcasting before,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6324" target="_blank">01:45:24.220</a></span> | <span class="t">it's a really good time to pause the video and look carefully at each of these four cells before</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6331" target="_blank">01:45:31.820</a></span> | <span class="t">and understand, what did I do there? Why did I do it? What am I showing you? And then experiment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6339" target="_blank">01:45:39.260</a></span> | <span class="t">with trying to, and so remember that we started with M1 0, right? So just like we have here ai,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6348" target="_blank">01:45:48.220</a></span> | <span class="t">okay? So that's why we've got i comma comma colon comma none, because this digit is actually M1 0.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6355" target="_blank">01:45:55.740</a></span> | <span class="t">This is like M1 0 colon none. So this line is doing exactly the same thing as this here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6364" target="_blank">01:46:04.700</a></span> | <span class="t">plus the sum. So let's check if this matmul is the same as it used to be, yet it's still working.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6372" target="_blank">01:46:12.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And the speed of it, okay, not bad. So 137 microseconds. So we've now gone from a time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6382" target="_blank">01:46:22.460</a></span> | <span class="t">from 500 milliseconds to about 0.1 milliseconds. Funnily enough on my, oh, actually, now I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6388" target="_blank">01:46:28.620</a></span> | <span class="t">about it. My MacBook Air is an M2, whereas this Mac Mini is an M1. So that's a little bit slower.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6393" target="_blank">01:46:33.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So my Air was a bit faster than 0.1 milliseconds. So overall, we've got about a 5,000 times</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6400" target="_blank">01:46:40.860</a></span> | <span class="t">speed improvement. So that is pretty exciting. And since it's so fast now, there's no need to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6408" target="_blank">01:46:48.700</a></span> | <span class="t">use a mini batch anymore. If you remember, we used a mini batch of, where is it? Of five images.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6420" target="_blank">01:47:00.540</a></span> | <span class="t">But now we can actually use the whole data set because it's so fast. So now we can do the whole</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6425" target="_blank">01:47:05.020</a></span> | <span class="t">data set. There it is. We've now got 50,000 by 10, which is what we want. And so it's taking us only</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6435" target="_blank">01:47:15.580</a></span> | <span class="t">656 milliseconds now to do the whole data set. So this is actually getting to a point now where we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6440" target="_blank">01:47:20.860</a></span> | <span class="t">could start to create and train some simple models in a reasonable amount of time. So that's good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6446" target="_blank">01:47:26.220</a></span> | <span class="t">news. All right. I think that's probably a good time to take a break. We don't have too much more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6455" target="_blank">01:47:35.100</a></span> | <span class="t">of this to go, but I don't want to keep you guys up too late. So hopefully you learned something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6462" target="_blank">01:47:42.460</a></span> | <span class="t">interesting about broadcasting today. I cannot overemphasize how widely useful this is in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6471" target="_blank">01:47:51.900</a></span> | <span class="t">all deep learning and machine learning code. It comes up all the time. It's basically our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6477" target="_blank">01:47:57.100</a></span> | <span class="t">number one, most critical kind of foundational operation. So yeah, take your time practicing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6485" target="_blank">01:48:05.820</a></span> | <span class="t">it and also good luck with your diffusion homework from the first half of the lesson.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6491" target="_blank">01:48:11.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Thanks for joining us, and I'll see you next time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf-8F5q8Xww&t=6494" target="_blank">01:48:14.780</a></span> | <span class="t">[BLANK_AUDIO]</span></div></div></body></html>
