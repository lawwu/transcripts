And in Herculaneum, there was one villa in particular, and it had once been owned by the father-in-law of Julius Caesar. When Vesuvius erupted, those towns were buried and forgotten. And so in 1750, a farm worker who was digging a well struck this marble paving stone, and they found all these treasures.</p><p>But it was also the home to a huge library of papyrus scrolls. The current situation is we have 600+ kind of roughly intact scrolls that we can't open. It's estimated that if we could read all of them, that would give us approximately doubling in the total ancient Roman or Greek text.</p><p>It would be like, no, we get all of the text that we have again. I read about a professor who had been trying to scan these using increasingly advanced imaging techniques to kind of virtually unroll them without ever opening them. We got to talking and decided to team up to launch a million dollar competition to decode the scrolls.</p></div></div></body></html>
