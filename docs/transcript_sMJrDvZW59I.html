Is that correct? The earlier is better.</p><p>The more intense it is and the more immersive it is, the longer you know that you can be exposed to that is really important. A lot of people can get exposed to early and basically lose it even though it's quote unquote during that sensitive period. Unless it's maintained, it can be very easily lost.</p><p>Then I think another aspect of it that's very interesting is some of the social requirements for it too. It's pretty clear that you can only go so far just listening to these sounds from a tape recording or something like that. There's something extra about real human interactions that activates the brain sensitivity to different speech bounds, allows us to become specialized for them for a given</p></div></div></body></html>
