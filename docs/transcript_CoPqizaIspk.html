Yeah. You know, of course it does, but is the juice worth the squeeze? Well, yeah, it absolutely is. I mean, we travel like this all the time. My family travels very frequently. I do find awards.</p><p>It does require a slightly different perspective in terms of how you look at booking travel. You put in a little bit of effort and you can be flying first class for next to nothing. And that is a pretty fantastic feeling, you know, with a modicum of effort, you can save yourself tons and tons of money, or what I often tell people is I spend less money than most people I know on vacation, but I get far more vacations and far more comfortable experiences because you do have plenty of those opportunities to travel around the world and feel like you're not paying for it.</p><p>To be honest. I mean, you'll pay your award taxes and fees, but when you're using Monopoly money to pay for the ticket and you're still getting the champagne and the caviar and the onboard chef or the shower or whatever it might be, it certainly feels pretty incredible.</p></div></div></body></html>
