And I think that everybody has their own unique experience with money. We grow up in different types of environments.</p><p>We grow with different types of parents and different types of role models to look to. And as a big part of that, historically, money, personal finance, and investing, they haven't been subjects that have ever been taught in school. A lot of schools have basically said, "You're gonna learn this from your parents, "and you're gonna learn this from outside of the classroom." So because of that, and because it's such an important topic that is emotionally charged, I think it is a very easy topic to have a lot of different opinions on.</p></div></div></body></html>
