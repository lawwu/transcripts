They can't bear what you bear. It's too personal. It's too deep. It's too complex.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl5f9NIGzNQ&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's too woven into a dozen other things in your life that themselves are all complex.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl5f9NIGzNQ&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">No one can grasp this or untangle this except God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl5f9NIGzNQ&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So when the old Negro spiritual says, "Nobody knows the trouble I've seen. Nobody knows but Jesus," it didn't mean they didn't have soul brothers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl5f9NIGzNQ&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It didn't mean that they didn't have any deep friends to unburden themselves to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl5f9NIGzNQ&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It didn't mean that they were loners who couldn't share their lives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl5f9NIGzNQ&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It meant that only goes so far. Sorrows and struggles and troubles are too deep, too personal to be known fully by others.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl5f9NIGzNQ&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the main thing I want to say to you, Adam, is that this life is marked by sad struggles to the end, not happy struggles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl5f9NIGzNQ&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Sad, sorrowful, painful struggles till the day we die. So steady yourself with that truth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl5f9NIGzNQ&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Don't have expectations that this life is going to be easy. Through many tribulations, we must enter the kingdom.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl5f9NIGzNQ&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And as I understand, the ongoing, remaining, indwelling sinfulness of the saints of God, that's not just external tribulations, but internal struggles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl5f9NIGzNQ&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, one more thing. Having said that, do fight in the right way. That is, fight for joy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl5f9NIGzNQ&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is not the opposite of what I just said. I'm not contradicting myself here. The fight itself is sad.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl5f9NIGzNQ&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You wish it weren't there. It ought not to be there. It must be there. It's right that it be there and wrong that it be there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl5f9NIGzNQ&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just the way it is in this fallen world. It hurts. We wish it weren't there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl5f9NIGzNQ&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In a world without the fall, without futility, it wouldn't be there. It's not going to be there in the age to come, but it's there and it's not pleasant while it's there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl5f9NIGzNQ&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But the way we fight is with the mighty death of Jesus, the mighty resurrection of Jesus, with the blood of Christ to cover all our sins and the unutterable complexity of our souls where we don't even know if it's sin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl5f9NIGzNQ&t=316" target="_blank">00:05:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We fight with the gospel and the all-sufficient blood of Christ. And we fight with promises, the promises of God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl5f9NIGzNQ&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That is, we put over against all the depressing voices of our body, all the depressing voices of our soul that are moaning with hopelessness in the battle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl5f9NIGzNQ&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We put over against them the voice of God, the promises of God. We preach to ourself, "Nothing is too hard for God. I will strengthen you. I will help you. I will hold you up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl5f9NIGzNQ&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I will meet all your needs. I will provide all grace for every good deed. I will give you words that you need. I will not let you be tested beyond what your spirit-given power is able.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl5f9NIGzNQ&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I will keep you from falling away. I will never leave you. I will be with you to the end."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl5f9NIGzNQ&t=367" target="_blank">00:06:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We preach these promises to ourselves in the name of Jesus. That's what I mean when I say, "Fight for joy."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl5f9NIGzNQ&t=374" target="_blank">00:06:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The battle itself is horrible sometimes, and the joy doesn't come out at the other end exactly the way we want it or the time we want it, but that's what we're after.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl5f9NIGzNQ&t=385" target="_blank">00:06:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the way to fight the battle. It's not just a battle of "No, no, no." It's a battle of "Reach, reach, reach," for you know there's a joy out there He has offered in the battle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl5f9NIGzNQ&t=396" target="_blank">00:06:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It can be maddening and overwhelming at times, but God gives victories. God shows up. In this life, there's ongoing brokenness, sorrow, but we can rejoice, and we can do it sometimes simultaneously.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl5f9NIGzNQ&t=415" target="_blank">00:06:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Sorrowful, yet always rejoicing. So I pray, Adam, that those two things will help, namely that this is our lot. The battle isn't pleasant. It's going to be there for all of us till the day we're dead, and yet there's a way to fight it that puts a strain of joy into our lives alongside and inside the sorrows that gets us to the end.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl5f9NIGzNQ&t=438" target="_blank">00:07:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Amen. Thank you, Pastor John. And speaking of sexual lust, there's a recent episode on this topic titled "Visualizing Christ to Battle Lust," episode number 304.
