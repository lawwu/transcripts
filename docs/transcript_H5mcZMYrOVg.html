Tell them you ready to party. And my prediction for the game today, I got Mizzou beating KU 42-7. -He's a nice tiger. -He's a nice tiger. High five. High five again. We're out here. You can see football, baby. Game of the year. I bet Justin Brown is on the team.</p><p>We've got two KU dads. KU don't spend a chance. We've got too many dogs on this team, man. KU, we're not worried about that. You know what I'm saying, man? We've got a lot of love from the hometown fans. We got a little recognition. Taught Kai how to wave to the fans, you know what I'm saying?</p><p>To teach him how to be a star at a young age. Because he's going to be a superstar. So, he's always dope coming home and getting love from the fans. Even though I only played for one year and barely even played, they're still showing me love. So, pretty dope.</p><p>So, pretty dope. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Got him. Hey, hey, hey. Come on, man. That's bad refereeing, dog. Whatever ref that is right there, that's bad refereeing, dog. That's bad refereeing, dog. Got him. Hey, hey, come on, man. That's bad refereeing, dog. Don't, whatever ref that is right there, that's bad refereeing, dog.</p><p>The game got quick on us, so we did back to the curb and finished up the game here. CD owes me 5K, so today was a good day. You know, Mizzou over Kansas every day, all day. Now we're kicking it at the crib. About to just chill with my brothers tonight, chop it up, but it was a good day, man.</p><p>Anytime Mizzou beats Kansas, it's a good day. We here at my parents' house right now shooting this little Curious Mike merch, you know what I'm saying? Dropping soon. We got two beautiful models right here that we're shooting with, my brother, and yeah, coming out soon. What's that pose right there, man?</p><p>Yeah, man, the merch is pretty dope. You know what I'm saying? Very comfortable. Got the logo on there, you know? Curious Mike logo. So, copy all the hoodie, copy all the shirt. We got some more merch coming soon, some hats, some phone cases, all up. And we out here at the Curious Mike merch photo shoot at my family's crib.</p><p>Got some hoodies, got some t-shirts. We got some good merch coming soon for y'all. My sister Sierra is doing the photography, best photographer in the game. Check her out. She does freelance, all that. But yeah, man, we about to get these, these flicks and this Curious Mike merch, and it will be coming very shortly.</p><p>Cop you a hoodie? Cop you a tee? Yes, sir. Yeah, man. What about with the ball, like, chilling? Kind of look at you, your eyes can be closed, but look up at them. All right, just talk about this merch. Is it comfortable? How do you guys like to fit?</p><p>Hey guys, so we are here for the Curious Mike campaign. Okay, restart. Shout your IG out, all that. Okay, shout out, um, I'm Avario and I. I'm Julia and Maya. Um, yeah, the merch, I mean, we love it. Super comfy. Definitely get the big sizes. I'm an oversized baddie, always.</p><p>All right, well, you're featured on my next Curious Mike vlog, the last one we pulled up on you at the Mamba game. We saw you get buckets. I don't know if you watched it. Did you watch? So we got your buckets? I didn't watch it yet. Oh, that's wrong.</p><p>Well, so far, what do you think about Curious Mike? I think it's a very cool thing, and I think that it influences a lot of people. What do you think about the merch? Is the merch dripping? That's tough. I always like that. I like that. Are you dropping it?</p><p>So, yeah, I'm about to drop this soon. At the Mamba game, was that slight for you? Like, was that, it was easy for you out there? Well, for me, it was hard because I didn't play all summer due to my back, and then I only was able to work out one week before, but, I mean, it was still a cool experience.</p><p>What are you making right here? Smoothie, protein. Tell them what you put in a smoothie to become an elite athlete. Gotta do some mixed berries. Some mixed berries. Some mango. Some mango. Some collagen, which is in the pantry, some frozen tatter, except don't show this because this is not the healthiest.</p><p>It's frozen tatter, but it's tasty. Nice. Little tips from Jada, and she's also is a chef. She's going to start her own bakery soon, so we will be keeping up with her throughout these vlogs as well. So, Mom. How you doing? We're at your beautiful home, and we just want to get a little snippet, just for my next vlog, on what you think about Carrie's mic so far.</p><p>Oh, shoot. You're putting me on the spot. I know you have your thoughts about, you know. There's some tumultuous things and some really, really, really good things. I love the really, really, really good things. What do you think about the merch? The merch is fighting. What is something you hate that I've done so far?</p><p>No, I'm not going there. All right. What is something you love that I've done so far? Oh, you know I love that you've been talking about Jesus. Okay. You absolutely know I love that. Guys, this is my mother, Lisa Porter. We are doing a full podcast episode to sit down with her and my dad very shortly.</p><p>She's going to talk about how she raised eight kids, homeschooled all of us, and the rest of our time. The secret. Yep, all the secrets of being super women, so that's coming shortly as well. Can I not be eating a tomato? No, y'all, y'all, I got to put y'all on the spot.</p><p>So how was the photo shoot today? I need to swallow it first. It was really good, and I like your creative vision. Really? Yeah, chill. I would like to know how, Julia, I would like to know how you and Javon met. Who slid into who? She slid on me.</p><p>That's not true. Where? I would never. One more time? She slid on me. No, don't, that's not true. So what happened, Julia? From your perspective, what happened? I met him at a dinner a year ago. We got him no time for a year? We didn't speak. Where y'all at?</p><p>What is y'all's thoughts on Columbia, Missouri so far? The crib? It's cool. Since we're out here, I like it. It's peaceful. Really? It's refreshing. So, Curious Mike flew these two gorgeous women all the way out just to be models for my Curious Mike merch, and they have been troopers today, so I appreciate them.</p><p>We're on a brand trip. Um, is Missouri what y'all thought it would be, or no? Well, I told you I thought it was going to be like a lot of swamps. It's definitely a lot of love. Stop talking. What do you think about the people like the Mizzou game?</p><p>You need a PR, you need media training. I know, I need some. I think anything you're going to do in life, it's best to be open and be yourself. So, if I'm in Columbia, Missouri with a jaunt, I'm in Columbia, Missouri. Whoa, not with a jaunt. Not with a jaunt.</p><p>What would you like to be referred to as, too? This lovely lady I met last week. I actually met last week. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Can we talk a little bit about the dilemma going on here at the Porter household right now, the little sticky situation that you're in?</p><p>We have fight the situation. What's going on? Should we speak on it? I mean, let's feed the people. This isn't coming out for a week, man. By then, you know what I mean? Man, we're in quite the dilemma. And honestly, I don't even know how we got here. But, turns out, my sister, one of her friends, man, she's helping her with some...</p><p>Wait, wait, wait, stop. What are you doing? She's helping her with some brand stuff. Stop, what's going on? No, no, no, no. And, uh... What the fuck's happening? Oh, my gosh. What are we doing? We're in an unfortunate situation, man. OnlyFans, do you want to get this exclusive? Say that one more time.</p><p>Where does it go? This goes on to Carrie's Mike. OnlyFans, man. That's what OnlyFans needs to be, is people being unfiltered. Not in a sexual way, but showing their true selves. You know how on Instagram, you try to be perfect? Well, yeah, it's kind of like TikTok. Obvious. What?</p><p>Like, on OnlyFans, people try to be promiscuous. But what if OnlyFans was somewhere where you just were, like, honest and authentic and not, like, scared of the public reaction? That'd be pretty cool. But why would you need to do that on OF? Because you guys always want to look perfect on the gram, so y'all aren't going to post y'all's real selves in y'all's real life.</p><p>What do y'all think about that new app called T? You're on there. Actually? You're on it? Of course he's on it. I'm on T. Yes. No, he wouldn't. You're messy, Michael. Oh, she's trying to be crazy. Have y'all heard of that new app called T where, like, you get to get reviewed?</p><p>Like, isn't it, like, where dudes are reviewed and, like, red flags are on there? That's all about it. I know I'm on that joint, probably, but I know mine's is probably green flags. Because there's not too many people that can say too many negatives about me, to be honest.</p><p>You know what I'm saying? I'm ready to be a family man. So, yeah. That's why you're back home with family. I'm back home with the family. Is that Christian? Is that Christian? My thoughts on Curious Mike. I think the uniqueness of the podcast and the show, man, I don't think you see a lot of it out there.</p><p>Just the honesty, the perspective, the just, like, uniqueness of it, I think is what makes it special. You don't see really, like, another podcast out there, except for probably, like, Joe Rogan, where you're just interviewing people from all walks of life. You know, it's not just athletes. It's not just people in the sports industry.</p><p>It's just taking the perspective of a lot of great minds and just unique individuals. And I think it's a dope thing that Mike has created, and it's cool to see him build and do what he loves and what he's really, really good at. I'm playing, like, I would never try to control a girl, but at the end of the day, if she's trying to be outside and she's with me, if we're, like, locked in and she's trying to be outside, it's not going to work.</p><p>When people are in a relationship, you should only be outside, outside, if you're with that other person. This little thing y'all got going is not going to last too long. No, we're just homies, man. Me and Fari are just homies. Jump in the pool. Fully clothed. Fully clothed? Yeah.</p><p>Wait, I'm not, I, I'll understand that. I'm not joking. Fully clothed. So now we've got to come up with a bet. Why do I film in here? How about this? Everybody pick up a rock. Oh, my God. I saw this in Mr. Beast's games. This rock is ugly. And you have to throw it.</p><p>It has to get as close as you can to the end of that without it going in the grass. But if it goes in the grass, like you want it to get as close as you can. So you want to play it safe. But the person who doesn't get it close enough loses.</p><p>Everybody on this vlog, Julia's lame. Don't hang out with her. Whatever. She's wet. Whatever. I don't want to ruin my hair. Ready? Oh. Grass. You're in it. You're going to line, so you're ready. Oh. Oh, my God. Are you almost tied? No, you're in the lead. You're in the lead.</p><p>Wait, that is actually insane. No, that was crazy. Now it's on Javon. And I rolled it. It's because of my technique. Stay down here. That's a lot of pressure. Yeah, I don't think he's clutch like that. Do I want a big rock or a small rock? I hear it.</p><p>Javon, the pool's open, bro. Look at this. Oh, my God. Okay, so you have to go jump in the pool. Wait, wait. Two out of three. What? You already lost the bed. Now you won't get in the water. Wait, what bed did you lose? Sean, this thug won't even get in the water after he lost his bed.</p><p>I said I'll get in later. We're about to work out. So after the workout, I'll jump right in. We're not working out for another 30 minutes. You'd be dry by then. What? By the workout? All right, I'll jump in right before the workout. How about that? Why would you jump in right before the workout?</p><p>So that I'm cool while I'm working out. He's just running his mouth. Guys, you can't trust people like this. I just said it before. I'll say it again. People that don't make do on their best are the worst type of people. And this guy, Javon Porter, you can't trust him with a thing.</p><p>You know what I'm saying? CB, this is a good man right here. This is a real man right here. He said, what number is your Zelle? I gave him my number. And let's go to where he Zelle'd me. Christian Braun. Christian Braun. Should I bet that? He sent you $3,500.</p><p>$3,500. It's only not $5,000 because he has a limit on his card. So he's sending an extra $1,500 today. I'm about to do it. What I said I'd do from the jump. And what I agreed to. But I just want y'all to know the only reason I'm doing this is because I'm an honest man.</p><p>And if that guy was in my same predicament, don't let him fool you. He would not be following through. How is it? The water's pretty nice, man. It probably feels good. It's a good, honest man right there. You know what I'm saying? I didn't think he was going to do it, but he came through and he did it.</p><p>Proved the world wrong, that he was a bad guy. I don't got nothing negative to say about him no more. Shine getting the strap, man. Y'all better watch out, man. Jump and look real pure. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here.</p><p>I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here.</p><p>I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here.</p><p>I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. This is my son, Cassius, man. I wanted to introduce y'all to... You know, I know I've kept my child under wraps, but it's not a lot of fun. But this is my son, Cassius. You know what I'm saying? He's one years old.</p><p>Actually, he's six months old. Say hi. Now, this is my nephew right here. My one of three nephews. My boy, Cash. He's on the 98th percentile. He's going to be a superstar. Yeah, give him a smile. Give him a smile. Hey. Cash is tough, man. I love kids. Need to have me a kid of my own soon, but haven't found any worthy candidates.</p><p>You know what I mean? So, for now, I'm going to just be the best uncle in the world. Teach these young bulls how to be some ballers. Yes, sir. How does it feel to be Unc? To be Uncle Mike? Unc. I pride myself on being the best uncle in the world.</p><p>So, you know, I got little Nicodemus, who y'all have met. Curious Nick. Curious Nick. I got... No, they haven't met him yet. Huh? He's not in a video yet. Oh, yeah. We all will meet Curious Nick soon. You know, that was my first nephew. Then I got Kai, who y'all met yesterday at the game.</p><p>I got baby Cassius right here, and then my brother Jonte with his baby. Hey, baby. What's wrong? I need that. Don't cry, baby Cassius. Don't cry, baby Cassius. What's up, Doc? Hey, what's up, man? You giving him up? Yeah, I give him up, man. That's my dude. I'm not mad.</p><p>What's up, little head? What's up, little head? Is he lighter than we were when we were babies? I mean, all of y'all were light at one point. Really? Mm-hmm. Yes. I need to do this, buddy. Yeah. Is it good? I have you, baby. You're crazy. You. Happy birthday to the birthday girl.</p><p>Thank you. How does it feel to be 32? I have three years till I'm 32. Three years till you're 32? Let's see the baby. I'm still in my 20s. I'm a young buck. Let's see the baby. For one last year. Let's go. What's your birthday wish? For one of these by my next birthday.</p><p>Yeah. Oh, wow. That's my birthday wish. Let's go talk to her husband about this. Okay, I'm gonna do it now. Christian. She said that her birthday wish is to have a baby by next birthday. What do you think about that? Can you deliver? No, I want to deliver. I'd say there's a 70% chance.</p><p>Can you do it? 70% chance? We can deliver. Hi, buddy. Cheese. Cheese. Cheese. Can I try? You want to take a video? No. No. Take a pic of microwave. Yeah. Cheese. No, I want to do it. No, we doing it together like that. Cheese. Cheese. Say, here. Say, hike.</p><p>I want filters. Huh? I want filters. You want a filter? Yeah. Huh? I'll make my baby. You can pick your baby's features from the drop. If I was to pick a baby's features, I would pick my babies to look like Kai Kai or like Cashews. Guess what? I'm gonna eat.</p><p>Let me see. Let me see. Let me see. Let me see. Let me see. Let me see. Hey, boy. Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh. It's fun to go. I was gifted this LeBooBoo, but everybody's telling me it's demonic. Is this true? Y'all let me know. This camera's about to really piss me off.</p><p>Let me see him. Oh, the little baby's sleeping. Here, let's pause. Kai, whoop him. Hold on. Stop. Take a deep breath and listen to your mom. Don't listen to bad guys. Don't listen to that bad guy. Take a deep breath. Good. And tell Isaac, I'm not gonna play fight.</p><p>I'm not gonna play fight. Okay, will you give me a hug? Give me a hug. Give me a hug. Good talk. Give me a hug. You can give him a hug now. Cause you're not gonna play. You're gonna hug. Listen. You give Uncle Isaac a hug. Yeah. Is Kai a good boy or a bad boy?</p><p>Kai's a wonderful boy. He is? I thought we weren't playing. He plays really hard. I thought we weren't playing. Oh. And guess what else Kai Kai? You stink. You don't think. Cause you take a lot of baths. Tell him. I take a bath. No, you didn't take a bath.</p><p>You stink like a booty. No, he's the fat. You stink bad, isn't he? Tell him he has to give you a dollar. He has to give you a dollar cause he said booty. He said booty. Sorry. Okay. Well then you stink like a little poot. I'm gonna tell mom.</p><p>No. Yes. Come here. No. We don't want to listen to my mic. I have a question for you. What? Do you think as a white mother of eight black children you're allowed to say the n-word? No. Then why? Do you remember you used to call us your little monkeys?</p><p>No, I didn't. Jada, didn't she call us her little monkeys back in the day? No, we were all little monkeys jumping on the bed. What'd she used to say to us? She wrote us this monkey book about monkeys jumping on the bed. Kari, look at us. Look at this, Kari.</p><p>Look. Tell them a message. Tell the fans something nice about you. I'm kaka. You're a kaka? Mm-hmm. Are they cool or no? I eat chocolate. You a chocolate? I'm chocolate. Is it good? Mm-hmm. Am I your favorite? Mm-hmm. Kai, what'd you say? Am I cooler than I did? What'd you say, K?</p><p>Chocolate. Who's your favorite? Michael. Yeah, Michael's your favorite. Wait, Kai, come here. As someone who's very critical of your brother, what do you think about my most recent content, the one, the last podcast I had you watch? Okay, the last. Can you please tell them as a very, how do I put this?</p><p>As a woman who is strongly for woman, might I say feminist. What do you think about my most recent things? I thought the last podcast was a really good, open conversation between men and women sharing their perspectives and experiences in a respectful way. I appreciated your openness to hearing what, like, from a female perspective.</p><p>And I felt like you showed good humility and acknowledging that you might be wrong on some of your takes. And so, I really liked it. Do you think I'm wrong on a lot of my takes? Mmm, some takes. I think you're wrong. Can you name one specifically that you think I got wrong?</p><p>I think that your view of, like, dating and relationships has been evolving. And I used to not really agree with the way you viewed it. But in that podcast, I felt like I aligned a lot more with how you were talking about it. Hey guys, this lady right here tried to get my brother-in-law to take our last name.</p><p>It was a brief idea. It was a brief idea. But they made the cutest little baby. And they don't have the same last name as me or my husband. Isn't that crazy? Really? What is their last name? They're Wilkerson because that's Reese's birth name. For one sec. You don't have an arm.</p><p>Eww. Nasty me. Nasty. - I'm thirsty. - Man, this is Isaac's POV on the vlog. Square bears down there, whole bunch of them. Real one. - Come get me in the BB. - Man, look at this guy. Square bear number one. Now that's a cute baby, oh my goodness gracious.</p><p>Look at Booker. - This is Booker right here, man. Booker's a good little guy he takes after his favorite hunk in terms of looks, you know what I mean? - Yeah, right. - He's gonna be a handsome young fella. - All right, so this is what we call Kai Cam.</p><p>This is Kai Cam. - I wanna try. - Keep it right there. Now talk to the camera, what you got to say? - So Brie, what happened? You raised this puppy and then you gave him away? - Okay. He jumped on my infant baby and I just was hormonal and I couldn't.</p><p>And then I regretted it. - You reunited with him after how long? - Three years. - Three years since you've seen him? - It's emotional, a good emotional video for you. - I know, that's sad. This beautiful family right here takes care of Omar now. - Yeah, he seems happy and...</p><p>- Well, we don't be sick. - Hurry, hurry, go, go, go, go, go, go. - Oh yeah. - Oh. - All right, get in your lines. - Good job, baby. - All right, let's do this thing. - Yeah, you gotta go, go, go, go, go. - They'll probably drop it to us.</p><p>- No, they won't. - Good, good, good, good. Transfer good, transfer good. - Go Isaac. - Go Isaac. - Go Isaac. - Go, Isaac. - Go, Isaac. - Good, Isaac. - Go, Isaac. - Go, Isaac. - Go, Isaac. - Don't break it, Ty. - Go, go, go. - You got it, Ty.</p><p>Go, Christian. - Oh. - Oh. - Good, Ty. - It's good. - Stop it. - Oh. - Yay, we're nice at that. - Good, Ty, almost done, almost done, come on. - Ty, can you beat me? - Ty, I'm racing you. - Yeah. - Oh. - Hurry, hurry, hurry, I'll race you, it's right here.</p><p>- Pause. - Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go. - Oh. - He's a competitor. - Honey, you did so good. - Good job, boy. - So it's pretty brick in there today. Hey. - Woo, that was a great girl. - How is it? - Oh, yeah.</p><p>Refreshing. - Really? It's cold in here, though. Are you still gonna jump even though it's cold? - Yeah, jump. Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

You know, the fans accepted me.</p><p>And I got a lot of love for Denver. When I left to go to Brooklyn, they gave me all these jerseys, all my leftover unis. And it was, it was tough to look at, you know, through the years, all these different unis that I got to play in and do my thing.</p><p>And you know what I mean? But I'm no longer a Denver nugget. So what we're going to do is a little giveaway. I got all types of different unis right here.

A lot of them got the championship, um, the championship logo on there, as you can see. So these are some special jerseys.</p><p>I'm probably going to give away about 10 to 15 unis, man. I got a lot in here. These are all my unis from, from over the years. I got a bunch of them. So we're going to do a little giveaway. And I'm going to pick some of you guys to give some unis to.</p><p>Um, we're still coming up with the requirements to enter the chance to get one of these unis. But so far, what I'm thinking is you're going to have to follow me on all platforms, TikTok, Instagram, YouTube.

You guys mean the world to me, and I'm looking forward to doing this giveaway. Man, just capped off a good weekend at the crib. Um, I love coming back to Columbia, Missouri.

But overall, it was a good weekend.</p><p>I feel refreshed and restored and I'm ready to go lock in on the season, man. So I appreciate y'all watching the vlogs as always.
