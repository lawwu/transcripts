What do we do?" I looked at the baseline of, let's say we save 10%, and you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRBGV_UM9Bs&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">get a 6% investment return on a diversified portfolio.

If you look at the returns of European stocks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRBGV_UM9Bs&t=858" target="_blank">00:14:18.200</a></span> | <span class="t">versus U.S. stocks from 1970 to 2009, they had identical returns.

Since</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRBGV_UM9Bs&t=874" target="_blank">00:14:34.040</a></span> | <span class="t">2010, however, again, the S&P has been crushing it.

European stocks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRBGV_UM9Bs&t=879" target="_blank">00:14:39.560</a></span> | <span class="t">are up 5% annually.

I think the whole point is risk management. So, MSCI Japan, 1970 to 1989,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRBGV_UM9Bs&t=907" target="_blank">00:15:07.800</a></span> | <span class="t">it was up, so two decades, 5,600% in total, 22.4% per year. Just an amazing run. Like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRBGV_UM9Bs&t=915" target="_blank">00:15:15.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the 1980s and '90s for the U.S., Japan in the '70s and '80s blew it out of the water.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRBGV_UM9Bs&t=919" target="_blank">00:15:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Not even close. By 1989, Japan was 45% of the global stock market. The U.S. today is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRBGV_UM9Bs&t=923" target="_blank">00:15:23.960</a></span> | <span class="t">55%, so it was pretty close, actually. Everyone thought Japan was going to take over the world,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRBGV_UM9Bs&t=928" target="_blank">00:15:28.040</a></span> | <span class="t">right? Didn't happen. 1990 to present, Japan is up 20% in total, 0.6% per year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRBGV_UM9Bs&t=934" target="_blank">00:15:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Lewis: Not great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRBGV_UM9Bs&t=935" target="_blank">00:15:35.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Lewis: Again, that's before inflate. Not great. Interestingly enough, though, if you go 1970</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRBGV_UM9Bs&t=940" target="_blank">00:15:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to present, the MSCI Japan index is up 8.4% per year.

So, here's my line of thinking. You don't want to miss out on a Japan-like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRBGV_UM9Bs&t=950" target="_blank">00:15:50.040</a></span> | <span class="t">boom from the '70s and '80s, just like you don't want to take part totally and be over-concentrated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRBGV_UM9Bs&t=955" target="_blank">00:15:55.960</a></span> | <span class="t">in a Japan-like bust from 1990 to today. Obviously, that's an extreme example, but from 2000 to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRBGV_UM9Bs&t=961" target="_blank">00:16:01.240</a></span> | <span class="t">2009, the S&P had a total return of -9%. Put up the lost decade chart here. I've used this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRBGV_UM9Bs&t=966" target="_blank">00:16:06.520</a></span> | <span class="t">one many times over the years. S&P 500, over a decade, the first decade of the century,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRBGV_UM9Bs&t=970" target="_blank">00:16:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">down 9%.

So, would you probably be fine with a U.S.-only portfolio, if you could stick</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRBGV_UM9Bs&t=980" target="_blank">00:16:20.600</a></span> | <span class="t">with it?

Diversification, in my line of thinking, is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRBGV_UM9Bs&t=992" target="_blank">00:16:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">it's a hedge against the unknowable future.

That's right. So, let's talk about three benefits to investing in, say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRBGV_UM9Bs&t=1186" target="_blank">00:19:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">rental real estate. Number one is you get a deduction for depreciation. You can take</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRBGV_UM9Bs&t=1192" target="_blank">00:19:52.200</a></span> | <span class="t">a deduction for depreciation. This is an expense that you can write off on your tax return,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRBGV_UM9Bs&t=1196" target="_blank">00:19:56.640</a></span> | <span class="t">but it's just to account for wear and tear on the asset. So, it's powerful because it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRBGV_UM9Bs&t=1201" target="_blank">00:20:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">a tax expense, but it's not actually a cash expense. You're never going to write a check.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRBGV_UM9Bs&t=1205" target="_blank">00:20:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">This does seem like one of those things that, like, because houses appreciate over time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRBGV_UM9Bs&t=1210" target="_blank">00:20:10.040</a></span> | <span class="t">generally, but you get to take a write off for depreciation. That sounds like a pretty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRBGV_UM9Bs&t=1213" target="_blank">00:20:13.240</a></span> | <span class="t">good deal to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRBGV_UM9Bs&t=1214" target="_blank">00:20:14.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you're getting leverage.

It's very, very, very powerful. So, number</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRBGV_UM9Bs&t=1223" target="_blank">00:20:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">two in terms of real estate is all the other expenses that you can use. So, we're talking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRBGV_UM9Bs&t=1229" target="_blank">00:20:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">mortgage interest, real estate taxes, repairs, maintenance, even CPA fees.

So, that can essentially create the best of both worlds where you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRBGV_UM9Bs&t=1239" target="_blank">00:20:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">positive cash flow, but you have a tax loss on paper. So, number two, very, very powerful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRBGV_UM9Bs&t=1247" target="_blank">00:20:47.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Number three is potentially capital gain deferral through the 1031 exchange, which is kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRBGV_UM9Bs&t=1252" target="_blank">00:20:52.520</a></span> | <span class="t">a hot button issue. But if done correctly, a gain on the rental property or other investment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRBGV_UM9Bs&t=1259" target="_blank">00:20:59.320</a></span> | <span class="t">properties can be deferred when you sell the property if you purchase a replacement property</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRBGV_UM9Bs&t=1264" target="_blank">00:21:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">of greater or equal value. So, that gain can be deferred until you sell the replacement</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRBGV_UM9Bs&t=1270" target="_blank">00:21:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">property or if the replacement property is replaced, then you can just keep deferring</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRBGV_UM9Bs&t=1274" target="_blank">00:21:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">that gain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRBGV_UM9Bs&t=1275" target="_blank">00:21:15.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you have a rental property right now.

So, it's possible you never</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRBGV_UM9Bs&t=1296" target="_blank">00:21:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">pay tax on that gain.

So, how much should taxes even factor into an investment decision like this? Because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRBGV_UM9Bs&t=1303" target="_blank">00:21:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">this person points out, you can write a lot of this stuff off, but you have the headaches,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRBGV_UM9Bs&t=1308" target="_blank">00:21:48.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the maintenance, the taxes, all this stuff that goes into it, the realtor commissions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRBGV_UM9Bs&t=1311" target="_blank">00:21:51.720</a></span> | <span class="t">if you're going to sell it, the closing costs, all this stuff.

Or is that just for a very select group of people who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRBGV_UM9Bs&t=1320" target="_blank">00:22:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">know what they're doing in this stuff?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRBGV_UM9Bs&t=1321" target="_blank">00:22:01.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So, short answer, no.

For all three of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRBGV_UM9Bs&t=1326" target="_blank">00:22:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">those benefits I just gave you, I could take the total opposite side.

So, there's one. Number two is all these other expenses, you may be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRBGV_UM9Bs&t=1352" target="_blank">00:22:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">creating losses, but if you're not a rental real estate investor and you make over $150,000,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRBGV_UM9Bs&t=1357" target="_blank">00:22:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you can't use these losses on your tax return.
