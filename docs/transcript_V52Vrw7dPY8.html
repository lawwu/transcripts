I enjoy the thrill of the hunt, but not everybody does. And if you don't have a lot of extra time to do it, then I think an award booking service fills a really important need. And I think your point that the amount of savings you can have in the sense that if you redeem your points just through the credit card portal, because you're like, "Oh, I don't wanna bother with this," then you may be giving up $10,000 in value that you could have for just paying somebody a couple hundred bucks a person to book it for you.</p><p>- The award tools have come so far. A lot of these discovery tools have made it so easy. Three years ago, it would have been a lot more work. It's like search every route, every date. That's gotten a lot better. So it might seem like a lot of work.</p><p>You might realize, "Actually, I could do some of this searching on my own pretty quickly."</p></div></div></body></html>
