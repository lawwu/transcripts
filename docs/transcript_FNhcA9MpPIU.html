your doctor give you to make you lose all this weight what is your celebrity doctor giving you tell the truth do you get that new shot people people on twitter are like your your twitter account sounding a lot more like jay count and i'm like i think we're on the same diet i think that's what's going on here in three two let your winners ride brain man david sacks and instead we open source it to the fans and they've just gone crazy hey everybody hey everybody welcome to another episode of the all in pod with us today of course the queen of quinoa and from his castle in italy the cackling uh dictator chamath palihapitiya nice gardenias and back from his big big battle his brawl unblocked and undefeated the rain man himself david sacks and judging by the comments uh i'd say dominant oh you read the comments just another sign of your obsession with how you proceed don't like don't even i never read comments don't rule number one don't read the comments we're not doing it again it shows because you're not listening to the comments so it makes sense oh okay go ahead and you got your whole troll army how many people have you hired on your social media team to troll me from anonymous accounts on twitter now to prove your points now you're paranoid too all right i'm not gonna don't be paranoid don't be paranoid anyway look we've patched things up don't break the peace we have detente all right so freeburg is busy uh writing tweet storms now um about the drought in california which seems to be uh just gonna be a really bad year basically so freeburg walk us through it how bad is california's drought going to be this year so the drought is already very bad um i put out a lot of tweets at two in the morning last night i think i drank way too much caffeine yesterday i'm in the mountains and like the only way i can avoid having headaches is like drinking caffeine all day and it was a mistake it kept me up all night you're sure it's not fair maybe you're so excited about this that you just can't sleep when you're up into needles nick you could beat this out nick you gotta be no no keep that keep that so you know the the big tweet storm i put out at two in the morning last night kind of highlighted that there was a paper published in 2018 2019 that showed how you know north america particularly the western half of north america is in this you know mega drought that we haven't seen in you know 500 plus years and since that paper was published you know um in 2019 conditions have only worsened we talked about this a few pods ago but like the snowpack level in california reached zero percent throughout the entire state by june 1st that has never happened before temperatures in british columbia as you guys know reached over 120 degrees for several days in a row last week which has never been seen in history in british columbia um you know there was a paper published today that estimates that over a billion um animals and life forms were wiped out in the coastal region of british columbia because of this heat wave um and the temperatures in in california are obviously excessive as well not as bad as they were last year but what matters most is that the moisture conditions in our forest land is lower than we've ever seen at this time of year in history and so this all sets us up and and the other kind of big consequence the high temperatures is causing an increased demand for air conditioners that's the big variable in power demand on all grids and the low snowpack means that we're not getting hydroelectric power hydroelectric power is down by 70 percent in the state of california over where we were in 2019 because there's no snow that's melting causing the rivers to flow and about 11 to 15 percent of our state's electricity comes from hydroelectric power so we're going to have more power demand we have less power available we have extremely dry forests and so this is setting us up for a number of possible disasters this year and so rather than just trying to sound the alarm bells what i'm pointing out is that there may be some things that we should be thinking about doing to try and get ahead of some of the consequences of these big risks like you know having enough masks for people to breathe outside so we don't have to shut down schools and shut down outdoor work and all the things that might happen having community centers that have power available the state is scrambling to find excess power on the grid right now but um you know it just highlights that there's a moment here that is almost like where we were going into covid it may not happen but the probability is high enough that something bad may happen that we should probably start to get prepared for it you know we should probably be talking about the things we're doing to get prepared for it and we're talking about and we should be talking about the things we're going to do to make sure that communities are safe and people are safe and businesses can keep operating because if the state of california has 150 aqi which is the air quality index workers can't work outside and all the outdoor work which employs three million californians has to shut down and you know you kind of start to add these things up it's like what are we going to do as this happens not if this happens and we should kind of be planning for it and i don't see much happening in terms of planning and and preparation and talking about the opportunity history rhymes because if you remember uh and this is all going into a recall election in the fall uh this was a different but kind of equivalent setup where you guys remember we were having all these blackouts and brownouts when uh gray davis was recalled and then schwarzenegger just swooped up out of nowhere and you know people thought oh there's no chance and people were just frustrated because the quality of life took a measurable step backwards uh in the intervening six or nine months before the recall election and so it'll be really interesting to see how gavin newsom manages all of this because if he can't get the state's act together and you have all of these issues at hand and a credible candidate emerges um you could have some really interesting political fireworks in september a big part of this correct me if i'm wrong friedberg is that we live in essentially like a lot of desert area here in california and we just haven't invested in the desalinization plants we have one that's come on since 2005 and i think there's another one in socal that was mothballed and they during the last drought wanted to open it up again but we now have one in carlsbad the uh claude budd louis carlsbad desalinization plant that is now i think that cost us a billion bucks but israel correct me if i'm wrong is now they charge three times as much for water than we do so people take water seriously and they actually monitor their water usage and they have desalinization and they have more water than they need per capita well desal doesn't really solve a number of these problems that i'm highlighting you know the probability of the the forest land on the west coast not just in california but all up and down the west coast catching on fire is very high no number of desal plants is going to put out those fires when that happens the air quality is going to get really bad you know like we saw last year i don't know you guys remember i escaped to lake michigan last summer when the threads yeah yeah and it was um it was insane you know it doesn't desal plants don't solve the air quality problem where people can't work outside your kids can't go to school etc etc desal plants don't solve the problem of hydroelectric plants which requires snowpack to melt to get rivers to run to turn those turbines to generate electricity for the state nuclear would solve that though nuclear would solve that certainly and so you know the point is we're kind of reaching this apex of are we going to do climate change adaptation are we going to have um you know kind of long-term systemic solutions that we're going to start to put in place for these risks that we face and more importantly from an acute perspective in the near term what are the actions we should be taking to protect communities and get ahead of this problem so it's not a scramble after the crisis which is what we typically do with these sorts of crises we're not investing in infrastructure if we put in some nuclear power plants if we did more desal and we did more forest management or put more fire breaks into you know all this i'm talking about the simple solutions like i have a community three things would be massive wouldn't they well those are long-term solutions i'm talking about like for this summer oh this summer is it even solvable we need we need communities no but we need to prepare for what is going to happen this summer so when communities get run out what are we going to do you know do we have community centers set up where people can get water and power do we have masks available so that outdoor workers can keep working in the state you know all of these things that we could be doing to get in front of the inevitable consequences of these risks i think are things that we should be actively if you're in california you should order your air purifiers now we ordered six more of these conway ones that we used last year that were amazing get n95 masks we have the n95 masks we ordered them already and we're going to put in a power generator which i know not everybody is able to do but you can buy a portable one for as little as 300 or 400 bucks i think now so a portable generator in case you lose power stock up on everything else we need those solutions like i think there's going to be a big kind of power generator push right like distributed power has always been something that's the whole point of solar you get solar on your roof you get your own power um but how are you going to keep your ac running when it's 120 degrees outside if you have no power you know that that's kind of a very scary um circumstance of heat waves uh and it's um it's something that we should have a real plan around and if i were the governor or if i were kind of california leadership or leadership up and down the west coast you know the western governors um i'd probably be running a daily press conference starting now saying let's just get in front of this problem and talk about what are the risks we're seeing what are the problems we're seeing and what we're doing about it just so people feel reassured because you know square scrambling after a crisis doesn't make anyone feel better you know showing that we're prepared and we're taking action to get in front of this crisis which is not 100 certain but it's a greater than zero percent probability is something that could helpfully kind of reassure and start to put the pieces in place um for the near term by the way just just for those that don't really appreciate how interconnected everything is the basics the science basics on drought as i learned about them were really really incredible so you think okay well how how is all this stuff connected it turns out that you know as we have warmer and warmer temperatures yeah i didn't know this freebreak you probably do this but it accelerates soil evaporation and then there's this really terrible feedback loop that starts which is you have drier soil which means you have less vegetation and then as a result you have less what's called evapotranspiration which means there's less regional precipitation and then this whole thing just starts to spin and spin and spin you have warmer temperatures that results in less snowpack the snow plaque the snowpack melts earlier and we have a situation now in the united states which is just incredible i saw a graph which is uh one of soil moisture and it shows basically the western half of the united states is in the first percentile of soil moisture looking back over many many decades so well and then all of that vegetation dries up and then we're in a position fodder for more fires no jason we're well even worse than this we're in a position where you know we are threatening our own food supply and just just just to put a a finer point on this it's not just the western half of the united states that's now suffering from this it's brazil it's the mediterranean and southern europe and its large parts of africa you add up all those number of people there are many countries there that are actually self-sufficient which will then no longer be we'll have to import food that food quality is you know questionable at best in some cases so we're in a really tough position here and so it's isn't this all solvable with technology i mean if we just tax people a little more for the water usage if we really invested in the desal plants if we really invested in nuclear we could actually flip this whole thing the same way it's spiraling in the wrong direction it could spiral in the right direction two things on the water side i've been looking at water investing for a while there's a there's a real problem which is you know when i when i looked at this uh my team found some incredibly interesting opportunities largely it it evolves around owning water rights right and then basically selling them back to the state and when states get in difficult situations the problem is i think it's politically intolerable for let's just say somebody like me um to own those kinds of water to be a water baron yeah i think i think it's i think it's no bueno the the idea then that i had was like well maybe what we should be doing is buying these things and sticking them in a foundation so that we can guarantee water for people in certain states maybe that flies i'm not so sure that's the government's job that's the government's job and but then they're not doing their job but they're incompetent they're not doing their job but they're not doing their job but they're not doing their job but they're unfortunately not uh not as skilled as you'd want them to be on the stocks how would you spin this uh out of this death spiral and into abundance is there a way well i mean the the first thing to realize here is that this is not a black swan event i mean this is entirely foreseeable um drought conditions have existed in california for a long time in fact 200 years yeah well and even maybe going back millions of years i mean geologists have found evidence that you know millions of years ago you would have millions of acres of california burning every year and so drought conditions have existed for a long time uh has climate change amplified that and made it worse yes but this is entirely foreseeable we know we're dealing with these conditions and in fact back on his first day in office in 2019 newsom held his very first press conference about this issue on emergency preparedness for fires and he said that he was going to be the first person to be on the call for fire and he said that he was going to be the first person to be on the call for fire and he said that he was going to be the first person to be on the call for fire and he said that he was going to be the first person to be on the call for fire and he said that he was going to be the first person to be on the call for fire and he said that he was going to be the first person to be on the call for fire and he said that he was going to be the first person to be on the call for fire and he said that he was going to be the first person to be on the call for fire and he said that he was going to be the first person to be on the call for fire and he said that he was going to be the first person to be on the call for fire this recall is supposed to happen in the october november time frame they've moved it up to september because newsom thinks there's a higher chance of fading the worst of fire season by doing the election sooner the problem for him is that fire season now starts in august and so we could be in the middle of fire season when this recall election happens and this thing could boomerang on him but back to the point about you know newsom held this press conference back in in january of 2019 and the problem is there hasn't been any real fall through on forest management so you know newsom was recently caught in a lie saying that you know they had basically treated 90 000 acres this is what this article i'll put in the chat said in reality that only really treated about 11 000 acres even 90 000 would be inadequate right they're not doing enough and the way um you know i talked to a very prominent person who knows california politics well and knows all the players and what he said is look the fundamental problem is that gavin is not operational right he's fantastic at fundraising he says all the right things at press conferences but but not everything is about running for re-election and the problem is he has not managed to this outcome and and so now we're in the situation where to freebrook's point we're going to be scrambling after the fact now what is newsom's excuse going to be it's going to be you know climate change can be global warming it's kind of the all-purpose dog ate my homework excuse for anything that goes wrong is he can just blame it on climate change but the reality is we knew about climate change climate change something we're going to have to live with even if we stop it in its tracks from this point forward we're not going to be able to reverse the effects it's already had and so we need leaders who will step up and and get much more aggressive about preventing this problem i think my and by the way my tweet i didn't mention climate change at all i got you know i don't think that that's even the point the point is we are facing acute conditions on the in the western half of the united states right now that lead to a number of significant and severe consequences those acute conditions you know you could blame them on climate change and say that they're part of climate change it doesn't change the reality they are here today and we have to deal with them um and i think yeah we have a we have a couple of things that are that are uh going to happen here in short order that i think can make this thing accelerated a little so there's a an organization a department in the united states government that's not very well known called the u.s bureau of reclamation usbr and they are the ones that will make formal assessments of water levels and there's a really important assessment that's going to happen in lake mead at the end of this year and the reason why it's critical is that if the u.s bureau of reclamation measures lake mead under a certain threshold they can declare a tier one shortage and what that means just practically as a whole is that if the state of mead is not going to be able to deal with water levels that's going to be a huge challenge for us and so what we're going to do is we're going to start to deal with these sort of like rolling i don't know what we're even going to call these water out scenarios where uh it's not just about watering your lawn that's not going to be possible it's going to be a whole bunch of other things now there is a solution in the water level system but it's not going to be a solution that's going to be possible in the water level system as well and i think that's the most important thing that we're going to do and that's why we're going to start with the water level system because we're going to start with the water level system and then we're going to start with the water level system because it's going to be a huge challenge for us to deal with and so if we start with the water level system we're going to start with the water level system and then we're going to start with the water level system and then we're going to start with the water level system and then we're going to start with the water level system and then we're going to start with the water level system and then we're going to start with the water level system and then we're going to start with the water level system and then we're going to start with the water level system and then we're going to start with the water level system and then we're going to start with the water level system the aquifer to deliver drinking water to folks that are lacking water.</p><p>And this has been a multi year, you know, bordering on multi decades slog because of California politicians, because water has become highly politicised, no one wants to pay the full cost for a commodity that they frankly view is a right, but then they don't want to step in to do the work to actually make it reasonable and viable.</p><p>So this whole thing is just again, as David, as you said, the dog ate my homework. And now we're really playing with some very complicated things that are really out of the control and intellectual capacity of the frankly state governments, which is the interconnectedness of weather, temperature, water or soil or food supply.</p><p>It's a I think what's so frustrating. This is this is so easily solvable. And we are not doing the blocking and tackling the free throws the basic things. David Wright: Yeah, absolutely. And I think that's a really important point. And I think that's a really important point. Because if you look at just monitoring our water usage, I invested in two companies, one of them didn't work out.</p><p>But both of them were to monitor water usage. And what we learned was at a campus like Stanford, they have like four water meters, like they're not going down to the building level, in some cases, they'll be like four buildings on one water meter. And you can very easily at each sink, at each, you know, put a device that cost 25 bucks installed, it just wraps around the the water, the pipe, and it could tell you how it's flowing.</p><p>And we lose 2030% of our water to leaks. Nobody is monitoring their usage because there is no cost to it to schmutz point. And then you look at these crazy insane, almond and other agriculture in the middle of California. They are using flood irrigation, which I'm sure Friedberg can give us an education at versus what you know, the trip irrigation that they use and other reclaiming methods in Israel and other places.</p><p>So we look at water as like, to Schmutz point, some crazy, God given right that we can just splash it everywhere, we can take 20 minute showers. And then we allow how crazy is this, we allow the bottling of water in California, we allow these companies to bottle water and then sell it.</p><p>And we don't even monitor usage we have well, new. So entitled, it is gross. Newson's biggest donors, who's that family that grows all the almonds or whatever? Whoever they are the resnick's the resnick's single biggest don't them and the teachers union signals. Oh, Linda Resnick and those palm people with the palm stuff.</p><p>It's total political corruption, right? I mean, they get Chinatown. It's literally the movie Chinatown. Yeah. Well, I think so to this point about why aren't politicians solving the problems? I mean, to make a meta point, there's a great tweet from Thomas soul or the person who manages the Thomas soul.</p><p>Account. Where he said no one will really understand politics until they understand that politicians are not trying to solve our problems. They're trying to solve their own problems. Which are getting elected and reelected. That's number one, number two in office. That is their only goal three is far behind.</p><p>And that's basically the situation we have is, I think Newsom actually is a little bit like Trump, not in his personal style, but in that he thinks he can talk his way out of problems. And he's not going to focus on solving a problem. And he's not going to focus on solving a problem when he can just spin his way out of it.</p><p>By the way, I just think you guys should know the you know, because a lot of people talk about residential water use, that is also kind of an acute and local problem, where depending on your water supply, how much water you have available to your community. But in terms of aggregate water use, the vast majority of water in California is used in agriculture.</p><p>It's about 10x, what is used for residential applications. Yeah. So it's a huge part of our agriculture. By the way, it's not a bad thing. It's a huge part of our economy, that water has generally been fully available in aquifers, people bought that land with rights, they paid a premium for those rights to those aquifers.</p><p>This is a very complicated problem in California. And that, you know, supports a large part of the California economy. So you know, you can't just kind of blow them away. But 90% of water use in California is associated with AG. And it's not just a generally we need to save water problem.</p><p>It's very specific to a region and a community and their particular water source on the water. So it's a very complicated problem. And it's a very complicated problem. And it's a very complicated problem. And it's a very complicated problem. And it's a very complicated problem. And it's a very complicated problem.</p><p>And so it's a little bit more complicated. But yeah, but we should be focused on abundance freeberg. If you look at the new nuclear power plants that you know, Bill Gates has invested in, and then you look at desalinization, which is an energy issue. We can desalinize for roughly two or three times the cost that we're getting water for now.</p><p>So just put a nuclear power plant next to a desalinization plant and you're done. Great. That's a 20 year project. And you got to why Why is it a 20 year project? China does it into you got to be more bold in this country. It is completely ridiculous that we accept that everything has to take 20 years.</p><p>We need this now. Where's the leadership that says, fuck it, let's do it immediately. Let's set a goal of two years to build 10 of these. Fucking money. I'm not sure it solves our acute problems. It solves long term problems associated with climate change and energy. We can't do both.</p><p>Let's do both. Sure, we should do everything. But right now, the you know, the conditions indicate that there are some specific things that we can and should be doing to kind of support the state in terms of what's going to happen in the next year or two. And yes, we should also be funding long term projects that create water security and energy security for everyone in the United States.</p><p>But SACS to your point, and by the way, if you guys ever want to read an interesting book about how the grid operates, there's a book called the grid. And it talks about how the electrical power grid system was built in the United States and how inefficient it is and all the problems.</p><p>There are a lot of structural problems that need to be solved. Not just, you know, dropping and cheaply. Cheap power. SACS, who is the good operational candidate that you've seen that's running for governor of California in this recall? Is there someone that stands out in your mind? Because I don't seem to hear anyone talking about, hey, there's a good alternative to Gavin Newsom at this point.</p><p>Yeah, I mean, we don't a clear alternative has not emerged yet. You know, I guess the end part of the problem is that because there was no Republican primary, you haven't sort of consolidated the opposition to a leading candidate. There are a couple of, I guess, interesting candidates on the Republican side, I need to spend more time getting to, you know, know them.</p><p>I mean, I have never met them or talk to them. But the two who are I think, mentioned quite a bit are this guy, Falconer, who's the mayor of San Diego, who is sort of a socially liberal Republican. And then there's a state assemblyman named Kevin Kiley, who, who I think says a lot of interesting things.</p><p>And he just announced he's running. There's another guy as well, John Cox, but he got trounced by Newsom in the last election, I think it's time to let somebody else take a shot against him. And then of course, you've got Caitlyn Jenner, but I think people are still trying to figure out if her campaign is real or how real it is.</p><p>So yeah, look, we the opposition has not consolidated against Newsom, the way it did with Schwarzenegger, you know, back in 2001. I'm voting. I'm voting Republican, just to create a counterbalance. I don't care who it is. And I'm not a Republican. I'm an independent. But I'm voting across the board.</p><p>I'm just going to go to Republican for every position in California. And I'm going to just run my finger down the line. How does it feel to be a radical Trump supporter? I listen, I am not for Trump. But Chamath, talk to us about nuclear and what we can do to get to reverse with these hippie dippy well intentioned no nukes concert set us back 50 years.</p><p>And let's be honest, we're going to have to do a lot of work. And I'm going to be honest, a lot of the climate change problems we have today we would not have if we had invested in nuclear Yeah, I said, Well, I sent her on an image, Nick, maybe you can stick it in the show notes or something so that people can see but if you if you look at if you graph the construction of nuclear reactors from the great 60s 1960s to today, essentially what and you color code them by country, what essentially you see is a transition from the able from the frankly, from countries that are not nuclear reactors, from countries that are not nuclear reactors, from countries that basically were just right at the leading the pack, and it was really the United States, building building building, and then two things really happened.</p><p>There was Three Mile Island, and then there was Chernobyl. And there was an incredible over reaction to not really understanding either the cause, and or the remediation to two events. Now, could you imagine if there were two airlines that crashed and we stopped flying? How basically we would have, you know, retarded the progress of the world.</p><p>And now you impose it on something like nuclear energy, which is consistently proven to provide an enormous, the abundant, cheap, and clean form of sustainable energy. And it actually solves a bunch of the problems we talked about before. So for example, if you look at the power consumption for desalination, it's off the charts, quite honestly, okay, that's why people say that it can't be done credibly.</p><p>If you look at even nuclear power consumption, it's off the charts, quite honestly. Okay, that's why people say that it can't be done credibly. If you look at in just like the amount of energy that's required to clean water and to, you know, sanitize water and make it drinkable, the, the standards that are defined by the government are incredibly stringent, but the implication of it operationally is an enormous amount of power that goes into it.</p><p>But Jason, you are right, which is that if we have small forms of sustainable abundant energy that can be basically hyper localized and located where we can do these jobs, the jobs to be done, it's transformational. Now, why doesn't it happen? It doesn't happen because the same folks who really want to sound the alarm bells on climate change, which is the progressive left are not really willing.</p><p>They're intellectually lazy when it comes to nuclear, they don't do the work. They make a brand sort of broad based prognostication about how we need to do something about climate. Then they will point to solar and wind without really understanding the contamination of the earth that we do in order to mine.</p><p>The. Rare earths and the actual metal and mineral inputs that are required for solar. It's nuts, but it sounds better, right? It sounds better. It sounds better. It's better optics. Oh, we're using air and the sun. The sun and it's abundant. And it's like, if I could show you what, what tailings are and like the dirty after effects of mining copper and nickel out of the ground, which is what we need for batteries and how countries like Indonesia are literally dumping it into the ocean.</p><p>Dumping it faster that they can get their hands on it so that they can sell copper and nickel and cobalt to us so that we can make batteries. You would actually say to yourself, if you knew all these facts, you'd actually say to yourself, you know what? Maybe nuclear isn't so bad.</p><p>And maybe I overreacted to two incidents. You want to understand this. You just have to look at the laziest group of individuals and society. The French, they want to take the laziest route and do the least amount of work and have the most amount of leisure. Sorry to our French listeners.</p><p>70%. 70% of the energy in France is from nuclear. They figured this out. They said, how do we take more time off and not work and have unlimited electric 70% nuclear. They're so smart. Well, the French are actually smart because after they're smart, because after Fukushima, what happened is if you had, you know, sort of like woke politicians, Germany, a bunch of Germany, they completely unwound their entire nuclear agenda, which was down, which was insanity, insanity.</p><p>And so now here they are, they're writing laws faster than they can make them up. They're basically pivoting entire industries to try to now adopt batteries and storage without any real understanding about the downstream implications to the earth that they are going to create. The net consequences. If they had just stayed the course on nuclear, they would be in a much better place.</p><p>And to France's credit, they were like, what the fuck are you people overreacting about? Again, you know, I'm not saying that. I'm not saying that they're going to make a big impact on the future. They're going to make a big impact on the future. I'm not saying that they're going to make a big impact on the future.</p><p>I'm not saying that they're going to make a big impact on the future. I'm saying that they're going to make a big impact on the future. I'm not saying that they're going to make a big impact on the future. So, again, just think about this, guys. The pragmatism is delightful.</p><p>If we stopped flying after two airline crashes, where would the world be? Where would the world be? I mean, be pragmatists here. Do we want to deal with high energy prices and brownouts and all kinds of problems and rolling blackouts or do we want to put this issue behind us?</p><p>If we just go on a Manhattan Project literally to make new nuclear, we would be, this issue would be behind us and we could focus on something else like education. It's so dumb. The very scary thing about nuclear is despite all of the progress, it will get bogged down in litigation and bureaucracy.</p><p>These are the last two things that should be in front of science and physics, especially when it comes to energy independence. I just think it's crazy. Can you break any way out? Any way we can get people to, what's the best way to convince the American public to embrace nuclear and force our politicians to do it?</p><p>Open your mind and think for yourself. Right. Please read a book. Mark Andreessen had a good term. He said we're living in a "Vetocracy" as in the word veto. I think it was an interesting interview with Antonio Garcia Martinez on his blog. Anyway, yeah, they were talking about the inability of the US to build anything anymore, especially when you compare us to some place like China.</p><p>And whether you want to call it NIMBYism or VETOCRACY, there are just too many people and groups who have the right to say no to anything and block anything important from happening. But we got to stop letting our politicians off the hook by making excuses. Just because there's climate change doesn't mean that the politicians can't do anything about it.</p><p>I mean, welcome to the downstream consequences of a successful democracy, right? Like a democracy over time doesn't reduce the number of laws it has. Every year, politicians need to do their job and they create new laws. As new laws accumulate, like the things get clogged up, right? Like, when have you seen a law that gets passed by a local government, a state government or federal government that makes it easier to do something?</p><p>I get that. But where does it say in the Constitution of the United States that being part of a democracy also means shutting your brain off and becoming a dumb cynic? Yeah. That's so stupid. That's not part of what being part of a democracy is. By the way, I want to talk about that for one second.</p><p>There was this thing that I sent you guys in the chat, and Nick, hopefully you post that in the show notes as well. But there was a study that was done about cynicism. And it went back and it did like a qualitative assessment of more than 200,000 people and their attitudes and their measured IQ, their measured literacy, their measured numeracy, and their measured earnings.</p><p>And here's what they found. Cynicism is associated with lower IQ, lower literacy, lower numeracy and lower earnings. The idea of cynical individuals being more competent appears to be a widespread, yet largely illusory lie. So I think we have to teach people- I think this makes sense. I mean- I was shocked by that study because I actually generally think cynical people must be smarter.</p><p>Yeah. They're smarter because they're thinking more rationally and maybe I'm being emotional. It turns out they're fucking stupid. Well, here's the thing. There's cynicism and then there's people who are cantankerous and not content. And I think people sometimes conflate those two things. If you look at the people- But constant pervasive cynicism is not a feature of democracy.</p><p>It means that you just stop thinking for yourself as a protective mechanism. Right. But the people we know who have changed the world and who- they seem to be- They're not cynical. They're not cynical. They're actually delusional and optimistic or else they wouldn't have started a company to make electric cars or whatever piece of software or climate.com or synthetic biology.</p><p>You have to be a radical optimist. I mean, we're literally trying to attack our incredible capitalists who are actually solving these problems while our politicians can't get their shit together and make desal plants and nuclear plants. The private market seems like the only solution Sachs had ever- Well, there's an old saying that pessimists get to be right and optimists get to be rich.</p><p>And yeah. I mean, if you think about it, pessimists don't create companies, right? No. They throw rocks. They become journalists. They become shit posters on Twitter. They become critics. They become critics. Yeah. Anton Ego. Right. I hate TUI. Sachs, what do you think about this idea that if we get into the throes of it for water, the folks that own water rights, I think that this is going to be like an eminent domain issue where the government is at some point just going to say, "Sorry, need it back.</p><p>It's mine." Yeah. During an emergency, for sure. For sure. But I mean, I hate to use the words, "I agree with J-Cal," but you know, look, there's not a shortage of water in the world, right? I mean, the world is mostly water, so it is a function of building desalination plants if, if that's what we need.</p><p>There has to be a solution for that problem. And Freiburg's right that maybe it does take a decade or two to put in place all that infrastructure, but then why didn't we start 10 years ago? You see, we should be starting a program where we convince the American public that abundance would lead to them having more freedom and our country being stronger.</p><p>Electrical abundance with nuclear, water abundance with desalinization, and agricultural abundance with those previous two. Because if you had unlimited nuclear energy and you had unlimited clean water, the price of agriculture would go down and we'd have more free food for everybody or lower cost food. I'll tell you, I'll tell you a theory I have on this.</p><p>And it's basically an anti-science theory, which is that, you know, culturally, we've kind of developed this anti-innovation, anti-science mentality, broadly speaking, across kind of modern culture in the United States. If you remember coming out of World War II, and I think it has its roots in the Cold War, you know, out of when World War II ended, you know, we were all in it together.</p><p>You know, this country, everyone bought the same stuff. We all had Rice Krispies every day. We all kind of, you know, were excited about our homes that look like everyone else's home on the block. And technology was empowering all of this, right? There was a space race on. There were plastics that were suddenly allowing us to make all sorts of amazing things.</p><p>There were chemicals that were creating new drugs for humans and new applications for our agriculture that was making an abundance of food and increasing lifespans and so on. But then what happened in the late 60s and 70s is we realized we got ahead of ourselves. And, you know, there was cancer from DDT.</p><p>There was, you know, Three Mile Island. There was a number of pollutants that got into the environment that permanently damaged the environment from chemical companies. And we started to wake up and say, like, wait a second, all of this technology that we thought was so great. And was giving us this extraordinary abundance, it turns out is really risky and can cause massive unknown consequences.</p><p>And if you watch, I think I talked about this on our podcast once, but one of my favorite videos to watch, there's a video on YouTube from the Disney Channel History Institute. And they show the history of Tomorrowland at Disneyland. When Tomorrowland opened in 1955, every ride was all about adventuring into space and like traveling into the human body.</p><p>And they even had a ride for Monsanto where you would go into the micro world and look at plastics and stuff. And it was all about this amazing abundance. And technology. And the guy, the narrator on the video says, beginning in the late 60s, early 70s, we changed all the rides.</p><p>And the rides all became about the fear of technology. It was all about aliens attacking Earth. It was all about Captain EO was like, you know, the world became robotic and got taken over by unnatural things. Even Star Tours was about a robot that went awry and the robot doesn't know what it's doing.</p><p>So it drove us off course and we had to survive the robot. And so everything became subconscious or subliminally a little bit, this negative technology sentiment. And I think that that still persists. You know, there is an asymmetry. People take for granted the abundance over time because you get used to it, but you feel the acute pain of the loss when technology goes awry.</p><p>And then that becomes the social conscience. And I think we're still grappling with that. And I don't know how you reverse it. Well, you know what, Freeberg, are we not experiencing this right now, everybody, with COVID, where there's one group of people who are like, oh, my God, the science we were able to deploy in COVID and get through this so quickly.</p><p>It's so promising that the world's going to be better, net net after the pandemic, even with all the suffering, you could make an argument that that suffering is going to lead to more prosperity. And there's another group of people who are like the Delta variant. Let's get our masks back on.</p><p>And people want to take the Sinica rat on. As an individual, I don't want harm done to me or my kids or my environment. That's that's the I think the general kind of conscience. Right. And I don't care about the abundance because I've basically taken it for granted. And so now I find myself as an individual saying, you know what, we shouldn't do nuclear because look at what happened in Fukushima, forgetting the fact that you've been living off of free electricity practically for decades or whatever the case might be.</p><p>And free water. And free water and all these things. And I think that the abundance that technology delivers to humans because humans are only programmed to recognize change. They're not programmed to recognize absolutes. There's a lot of good socio psychological and evolutionary. Give us an example of that. Give us an example of that.</p><p>If you go to the store every day and you're used to just getting a $1 can of Coke, you don't say, oh my God, I feel it's an amazing world I live in. I get a $1 can of Coke. You never praise that $1 can of Coke. Now, if you went to the store and the can of Coke went up to $2, you'd be like, what the heck?</p><p>Why does Coke cost so much? And so, you know, so we habituate, but but you habituate to the great things in our life. The price of Coke dropped to 50 cents. You're like, okay, that feels good. And then you get used to the price of Coke being 50 cents.</p><p>And a few weeks later, if it goes up, you're upset, but you're not as happy on the other way. So human emotion is kind of asymmetrically, you know, defined by these negative consequences. And I think over time, you accumulate these negative consequences as your core psyche, and you have an aversion to doing, you know, innovative things as a whole, not all people, but as a whole, that's how we operate.</p><p>And it's why technology kind of gets lambasted over over time. This is the most frustrating thing to me. Chamath is that we have so many amazing things happening in technology, and nobody will 10x or 100x on them from the government perspective or the public. I had a company called Zero Mass on my podcast, which I think is now called Source.</p><p>And you're aware of this company. Maybe you could talk a little bit about the impact hydro panels would make if we just embrace this technology. Well, I mean, Source is an incredible, incredible company. Basically, there's a there's a guy who runs a Cody Friesen, who when he was at MIT, basically developed a essentially a material, a membrane that can absorb the ambient water that's in the atmosphere, and basically allow you to collect it and to separate it into its components and to basically create potable salinized or potable drinkable water in a panel that looks like a solar panel.</p><p>So you put these solar arrays everywhere. And out of the back, you put a little pipe and it collects the humidity in the ambient air and it spits out water. And it's, it's an incredible thing. And he's able to go and rewire schools. And, and the thing is, he can go anywhere because again, he doesn't need anything, right?</p><p>You literally put it on your roof. It's incredible. And it makes you if you I think he told me at the time when I interviewed him two or three years ago. He said you could put two of these on your roof and get like four cases of bottled water a day, no matter where you were on the planet.</p><p>And by the way, he's moving to a place which is really cool. He told me this. I'm not sure if I'm allowed to say it, but I'll say it anyways. This might be beeped. Now where he's going to be candidate. No, he'll have an eventual app where you can kind of direct the hydro panel to make the kind of water that you like.</p><p>So if you love or if you love, um, dial it in water, or if you love smart water or you're on the voice, right? Specifically because it's the most expensive. No, I love, I love smart water. I, I have a very gratuitous reason why I remember when I met jobs, he drank smart water.</p><p>And I thought, boop, it's good enough for him. It's good enough for me. I'll tell you when I knew Chamath made it. I just get to copy people. I can, you got to copy the good ones. And I was just like, this is a personal anecdote. This is when I knew Chamath made it.</p><p>We used to play poker in his garage, in his little 3000 square foot Palo Alto house. Little. No, Burlington, Burlington, Burlington. In Burlington, whatever. He had this little tiny house and we're in the garage and he's like, look, I'm putting up a flat panel. I'm going to like paint the walls.</p><p>No, we had a little, uh, you had a little, uh, easel and you'd write on chalk how much you owe. Yeah. You know, then. Chamath's like, I got a new house. He's got his new house. We come over. He's like, Jake, how you want some water? I'm like, yeah, I'd love a glass.</p><p>He's like, oh, Jake, how you want a beverage? I'm like, yeah, I'll take a glass of water. And, uh, he goes, oh, and he walks over to a rack. And in the rack, like, you know, those things you push wine on, there's a rack for water. And there is Voss in the glass bottles.</p><p>There is Evian in glass bottles. Old. And you're not like the Evian that you get at the regular supermarket. Like somebody sourced the Evian bottles, that restaurant. And then he had the smart, I mean, there's 60 and I'm like, I just wanted a glass of water, but okay, I'll take the Evian in the glass bottle.</p><p>It was delightful. Sax, I got three different bounce passes. I can give you just where you want it. Do you want cancel culture? Do you want Chesa Booden or. COVID. What do you want? Or COVID? I can give you any of these. I can. I'm ready to pass. I'm talking about any of those sound good to me.</p><p>I mean, the, the, the, it might be time for a chase update because we haven't done that in a while. The killer DA. The killer DA. Yeah. Oh, by the way, I just want to say, I found the journalist, you know, the journalist Sax, don't say her name. And she is setting up her LLC and the $60,000 we raised from the GoFundMe is going to go to her to cover the DA's office for the next six to 12 months in a newsletter website.</p><p>Right. And just to be clear, because I think people kind of misinterpreted what you were trying to do there with the GoFundMe JCal. Yes. This is not for opposition research. This is not. No. This is not digging up dirt. This is reporting on, uh, on On public policy on what should be public facts with respect to what the DA's office is doing, how chase is performing in his job.</p><p>Isn't it interesting though, how the left journalists, when I hired investigative journalists to cover criminal justice accused me of hiring an oppo researcher and these are investigative journalists. And I told them explicitly, I'm just hiring an investigative journalist to cover crime in San Francisco. There's no oppo research here.</p><p>And they insisted on saying, I wanted to get into Chessa's personal life. And I, Yeah. explicitly said that's not what this is for. Well, let's face it. There aren't too many journalists anymore who are investigative, who are actually in the business of turning up new facts about elected officials.</p><p>They're too busy pushing a narrative. They're engaged in agenda journalism. And actually we saw a really good example just to tie into, to what's happened, what happened over the past week is you had this story in the San Francisco Chronicle, which is basically pure propaganda, uh, from, you could see that the, the, um, the passing from Chessa to this reporter of this, this farcical, uh, claim that crime is falling in San Francisco.</p><p>Uh, I mean, this claim is so preposterous. This is the same week we saw viral videos of 10 robbers bursting out of Neiman Marcus, you know, with, With every hand. Yeah, exactly. And so, you know, plus you had the viral, It was scary. Yeah. You had the viral video of the, the guy going into, into CVS and just, you know, it wasn't even shoplifting.</p><p>It was, it was throwing up garbage bags. Did you see Brian Sugar's, uh, video of the person who broke into his house, stole his kids' iPads and everything while they were in the house? Right. And Cyan Bannister, who had another home invasion, just tweeted. Home invasions are now, um, not prosecutable crimes in San Francisco.</p><p>Well, no, what they're doing is, so what Cyan reported about her case is, and by the way, her case is in the public eye. Okay. So it's very brazen for the DA to be doing this, but what they did is they dropped the home invasion charges and they're just treating it as basically a, a theft of, you know, a few hundred dollars, you know, that does not capture the violation of breaking into someone's house and how dangerous that is.</p><p>But I originally, I thought, okay, why is the DA's office doing this originally? I thought, well, maybe it's just because, you know, Chasey doesn't want to incarcerate anybody, but it's more than that. You see, if they drop the charge, they're going to be in jail. They're going to be in prison.</p><p>They're going to be in prison for a long period of time. It's like, Oh, well, what's going on with this case? And then, you know, they're going to be in prison for a long time. And then they're going to be in prison for a long time. So they're going to have to go through all these charges down to petty larceny.</p><p>Then he can include it in a different stat. You see home burglaries are up by some gargantuan amount, like 50% year over year. Oh. They want to be able to claim crime is falling. It's now they're juking the stats by reducing the charges from the more serious crime to the less serious crime.</p><p>And then what they do is. Wow. They're shaping the stats. They're juking the stats. They're juking the stats. They're juking the stats. They're juking the stats. They're juking the stats. They're juking the stats. They're juking the stats.

They're juking the stats. They're juking the stats. They're juking the stats. They're juking the stats. You had this senior policy advisor to Chesa Boudin who works for the DA's office named Kate Chatfield, attacker basically implying her views were KKK values for having the audacity to warn that people are worried about crime in San Francisco.</p><p>So she gets attacked. By the way, this Chatfield person, the top of her profile is the clenched fist of the communist revolution, J. Cal. So this is who's running the DA. I love this. I love this. I love this. I love this. I love this. I love this. I love this.</p><p>I love this. But look, it's not just trolling, and it's not even just slander. It's I think an abuse of power for someone in the DA's office to go after and attack a concerned citizen like this, okay? But this is how they enforce. Can you read the tweet that she did?</p><p>Do you have that there? Yeah. Because she basically is, the people who have experienced home invasions are concerned for the safety of their families. And what this woman did, Michelle, I believe is her name, she just- She just said, like, people are scared for their families. And then Kate Chatfield referenced Birth of a Nation and compared her to, oh, our wives are not safe because of Black people.</p><p>And that's a KKK- Birth of a Nation. Birth of a Nation. Everybody knows Birth of a Nation. Birth of a Nation. Everybody understands what Birth of a Nation is. Yeah, the original name of Birth of a Nation, I think, was the Klansmen. Yeah. Yeah. It's like a KKK piece of propaganda.</p><p>Wow. But it's really outrageous. She just blocked me. She just blocked me. Kate Chatfield blocked me. Wow. This is a public policy advisor who's now hiding her account. Well, I mean, a public official should not do that. I mean, they should be- And so this set you off. Let's be honest.</p><p>It set you off. Well, I know Michelle Tandler. She worked at Yammer. And I thought it was out of bounds for not just a public official, but someone in the DA's office who has the power- So what did you do? Well, I just- You went into revenge mode. Let's be honest.</p><p>No, no. I don't- I don't think you did. I don't think you did. You just went into a little bit. Tweaked. I donated another $50,000 to the Recall Chasing Campaign. And you dedicated it to Kate. Yeah. You said, "This is for you." Yeah, because look, this is threatening. Every American should have the right to criticize their government without having its law enforcement arm come down on them.</p><p>And so here you have a legitimate concern expressed by a private citizen and the DA's office is coming down on them. That's not acceptable. I think I need to break some news here. I didn't want to talk about this publicly, but I'm so outraged now that I think I should let this out.</p><p>So while I- after the- in the weeks after I started that campaign to hire an investigative journalist for Chester's office, this is breaking news. I haven't talked about this publicly, but I'm going to break it now. Do you know who contacted me? The DA's office. Do you know what that means?</p><p>Do you know what they contacted me about? They were investigating a startup that I had invested in. I won't say which one. And they wanted to interview me about my involvement with that startup because that startup had some complaint from a downstream investor who felt that they were committing some type of fraud or problem.</p><p>Coincidence? Are you serious? I am dead serious. This is literally becoming Chinatown. They literally tried to intimidate me and I didn't want to bring it up. I talked to the person on the phone, the person from the DA's office who was investigating this, and I was like, "Do I need an attorney for this?</p><p>Why are you calling me?" And he said, "Well, you know, we just want to talk to you about this." And I was like, "Yeah." No. We have a bunch of questions. And I just said, "You know what? Subpoena me. I'm not, you know, file something and I'll come in with my attorney to talk to you, but I'm not going to talk with you on background.</p><p>No." So they literally tried to intimidate me. You know what? And I kind of let them because I didn't want to make it public, but I'm making it public now. And this is two weeks after I said, "Let's hire the journalist." It's intimidation tactics. It is intimidation tactics. That's intimidation.</p><p>I will not be intimidated, Chessa. All right. But what you can see here is, okay, look. I mean, I was intimidated. I'm not going to have me intimidated again. Now that I think about it, like I didn't do anything wrong here. I put 50k. I put 50 or 100k into a company that didn't work.</p><p>I put 50 to the company that didn't work. I put 50 to the company that didn't work. I put 50 to the company that didn't work. And now some other investor is complaining. And they're trying to tie it back to me somehow. But Jason, of course, you're going to be intimidated.</p><p>The chief law enforcement officer of San Francisco is basically trying to make you the target of an investigation because of what you said publicly. Of course, that is intimidation. Guys, isn't it possible that they're just interviewing you about a fraud claim? I mean, like what this... Wait, wait, hold on.</p><p>Think about the timing, Freebird. It's two or three weeks after... AM radio, like conspiracy theory, like... No, it's not. Two or three weeks after... You know what? I got it. I got it. I got to tell you something. A police officer drove past my house last night. Yeah. Freebird.</p><p>Okay. Wait, it's the first and only time I've ever been contacted by a law enforcement officer over an investment. I'm sure it's just a coincidence. Stop committing fraud. 350 investments. Yeah. Listen, Chesa has not had time. He's almost two years in office now, and he has not had time to successfully prosecute one murder trial.</p><p>Not one. But his office has time to run down whatever they're trying to run down with J-Cal. They don't have time to prosecute the home invader who broke into Cyan Banister's home. Or Brian's. Or Brian's. They don't have time to do that, but they somehow have time to contact J-Cal.</p><p>He tweeted the video. Let me explain what's going on here. There's two things going on. I think one of which is becoming very well understood, but the other one is not. The first one is the Gothamization of San Francisco. We understand that crime is out of control. Cynicism and resignation, people are just kind of given into it.</p><p>It feels like San Francisco has become Gotham City. These viral videos of the robbers brazenly committing daylight theft. There is no punishment. Beating up UPS drivers in the street. Beating a UPS driver in the street. Because there is no consequence, okay? But there's a second thing happening, which is the Orwellianization of San Francisco government and San Francisco politics.</p><p>You not only have the crime, you've got the brazen lies about the crime. You've got this insistence on this Animal Farm Commandment that crime is falling. And if you question it, you are a bad person. Are a Klansman. You are a Klansman. And then they get their, you know, the Kate Chatfields to push this out.</p><p>And then they get academics to back this up, okay? There are now, they get their friends in the media and in the academy to give these spurious claims credence. And then the final step is that the rich virtue signalers pay these people off. They pay the protection money. Who might that be?</p><p>Who's paying off? The Dustin Moskovitz's, the Mike Krieger's, the Reed Hastings. And, you know, even actually the biggest contributor to Chesa right now is a guy who's under SEC indictment for the Ripple scandal. Oh, no. Yeah. Chris? Chris, yes, exactly. So, people who need to curry favor either because they've got their own problems or they just like to virtue signal.</p><p>Chris Larsen. Chris Larsen is Chesa's biggest. Then fund this Orwellian campaign. Oh, wow. That is dark. Brian Sugar released the video and that person's not going to be prosecuted. I mean, that is the crazy part. You get somebody on camera and they won't prosecute them. And people forget these are organized gangs that are doing this.</p><p>This has been proven. This is not a poverty issue. These are not poor people who are stealing bread for their families or trying to make their rent. It's organized gangs. Right. Did you see the getaway cars? Who realized with Prop 47. Did you see the getaway cars for the Neiman Marcus heist?</p><p>Yeah, they're all like. The Mercedes. They're driving great, beautiful cars with their license plates off. This is like mob behavior. And if you give credit to the people who are doing this, they're going to get a lot of credit. Yeah. And I think that's the biggest thing.
