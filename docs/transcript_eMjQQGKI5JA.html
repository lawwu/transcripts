From what I've read of his, he takes seriously enough the question that we don't know what those future people will want, you know, there's no question that what we want today would have seemed abhorrent to people, you know, most people, 1800, you know, in, in 1800.</p><p>So the idea that we can have any other idea other than they probably want to be alive, it seems much more questionable. And so there's two ways to look at it. One is the, the wizards say, let's, you know, we have an idea. They're going to want to live in this, you know, a certain kind of utopia and live their longest lives and, and, and, have the maximum possible physical comfort, but the prophets might say, well, we should be more epistemologically, you know, humble say, we don't know what they want to let's preserve as many options as possible for them.</p><p>Cause that's the same argument about burying nuclear waste, which I also think it's very powerful that we should probably not bury it in some system where it can't be gotten rid of for 10,000 years, we should just make sure that we can track it for a couple hundred years and, and there'll be more options for people 200 years from now than there are today.</p></div></div></body></html>
