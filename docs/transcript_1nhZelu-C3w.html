Yeah. I like that idea. Here's what I don't like though. What happened in '07, '08, right? Is people have these adjustable mortgages for the same reason like that we're having today.</p><p>And so they'd get the arm because it was cheaper. And then when the market collapsed, the arm shot up to 28%. So all of a sudden people's mortgages went from a thousand to $5,000. And they lost their homes. That has been changed. There are now limits on what an arm can do.</p><p>A lot of people don't realize this. They think, oh, I would never get an adjustable rate mortgage. Cause I don't want '08 to happen again. Well, if you look at the paperwork and talk to your lenders, yeah, most arms have a max what they can get to. And it's somewhere in the, like the 11, 12% range.</p><p>So I, yeah, could rates stay high forever. And then your adjustable rate seven years from now goes up to 12%. That is possible. That is a risk. So if you really don't like risk, take a 30 year mortgage. You can refinance a 30 year mortgage too. But if you want to lower your interest rate and take a little gamble, that's what I typically do.</p><p>Yeah.</p></div></div></body></html>
