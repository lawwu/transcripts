Joe's open-mindedness and just genuine curiosity was a breath of fresh air, especially to me as a scientist, but in general as a thinking person. He inspired me to be a better and especially kinder human being. So it was surreal for me to be on there a couple of times last year, and I'll be on there again a third time on February 3rd. It feels like I'm Forrest Gump somehow finding myself shaking hands with John F. Kennedy. Anyway, I also enjoy playing guitar, and I thought I'd play the intro theme plus a bit more to say thank you for the 10 years of Jerry. As a wise man once said, "Train by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day." Thank you.</p></div></body></html>
