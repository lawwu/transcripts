PyTorch we don't have to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.760</a></span> | <span class="t">keep track of what our coefficients or parameters or weights are. PyTorch does that for us and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.680</a></span> | <span class="t">the way it does that is it looks inside our our module and it tries to find anything that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.960</a></span> | <span class="t">looks like a neural network parameter or a tensor of neural network parameters and it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">keeps track of them and so here is a class we've created called T which is a subclass</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">of module and I've created one thing inside it which is something with the attribute A.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is A in the T module and it just contains three ones and so the idea is you know maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">we're creating a module and we're initializing some parameter that we want to train.

Now in this case when we create our object of type T and ask for its parameters</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">we get told there are zero tensors of parameters and a list with nothing in it. Now why is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.880</a></span> | <span class="t">that we actually said we wanted to create three tensor with three ones in it how would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.960</a></span> | <span class="t">we make those parameters? Well the answer is that the way you create your way you tell</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.520</a></span> | <span class="t">PyTorch what your parameters are is you actually just have to put them inside a special object</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.600</a></span> | <span class="t">called an nn.parameter. This thing almost doesn't really do anything. In fact last time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I checked it really quite literally had almost no code in it sometimes these things change</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">but let's take a look. Yeah okay so it's about a dozen lines of code or 20 lines of code</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.840</a></span> | <span class="t">which does almost nothing it's got a way of being copied it's got a way of printing itself</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.040</a></span> | <span class="t">it's got a way of saving itself and it's got a way of being initialized. So parameter hardly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">does anything the key thing is though that when PyTorch checks to see which parameters</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">should it update when it optimizes it just looks for anything that's been wrapped in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=333" target="_blank">00:05:33.080</a></span> | <span class="t">this parameter class. So if we do exactly the same thing as before which is to set an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.700</a></span> | <span class="t">attribute containing a tensor with three ones in it but this case we wrap it in a parameter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=347" target="_blank">00:05:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">we now get told okay there's one parameter tensor in this model and it contains a tensor</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=355" target="_blank">00:05:55.080</a></span> | <span class="t">with three ones and you can see it also actually by default assumes that we're going to want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=361" target="_blank">00:06:01.080</a></span> | <span class="t">require gradient it's assuming that anything that's a parameter is something that you want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=364" target="_blank">00:06:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">to calculate gradients for. Now most of the time we don't have to do this because PyTorch</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=371" target="_blank">00:06:11.320</a></span> | <span class="t">provides lots of convenient things for us such as what you've seen before nn.linear</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=378" target="_blank">00:06:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">which is something that also contain creates a tensor so this would contain a create a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.920</a></span> | <span class="t">tensor of 1 by 3 without a bias term in it. This has not been wrapped in an nn.parameter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=392" target="_blank">00:06:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">but that's okay PyTorch knows that anything which is basically a layer in a neural net</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=399" target="_blank">00:06:39.320</a></span> | <span class="t">is going to be a parameter so it automatically considers this a parameter. So here's exactly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the same thing again I construct my object of type T I've checked for its parameters and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=411" target="_blank">00:06:51.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I can see there's three of one tensor of parameters and there's our three things and you'll notice</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=415" target="_blank">00:06:55.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that it's also automatically randomly initialize them which again is generally what we want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=424" target="_blank">00:07:04.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So PyTorch does go to some effort to try to make things easy for you. So the this attribute</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=435" target="_blank">00:07:15.880</a></span> | <span class="t">A is a is a linear layer and it's got a bunch of things in it one of the things in it is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=451" target="_blank">00:07:31.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the weights and that's where you'll actually find the parameters that is of type parameter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=457" target="_blank">00:07:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">so a linear layer is something that contains attributes of type parameter. Okay so what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=463" target="_blank">00:07:43.880</a></span> | <span class="t">we want to do is we want to create something that works just like this did which is something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=471" target="_blank">00:07:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">that creates a matrix which will be trained as we train the model. Okay so an embedding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=483" target="_blank">00:08:03.760</a></span> | <span class="t">is something which yeah it's going to create a matrix of this by this and it will be a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=493" target="_blank">00:08:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">parameter and it's something that yeah we need to be able to index into as we did here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=499" target="_blank">00:08:19.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and so yeah what is what is happening behind the scenes you know we're in PyTorch

And they don't have to be 3 by 3, right? You could have, we could just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3255" target="_blank">00:54:15.820</a></span> | <span class="t">have easily done 5 by 5, and then we'd have a 5 by 5 matrix of coefficients, or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3262" target="_blank">00:54:22.360</a></span> | <span class="t">whatever, whatever size you like. So the size of this is called its kernel size.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3267" target="_blank">00:54:27.700</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a 3 by 3 kernel for this convolution. So then, because this is deep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3278" target="_blank">00:54:38.100</a></span> | <span class="t">learning, we just repeat the, we just repeat these steps again and again and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3282" target="_blank">00:54:42.900</a></span> | <span class="t">again. So this is, this layer I'm calling conv1, it's the first convolutional</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3287" target="_blank">00:54:47.520</a></span> | <span class="t">layer.

We've got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3305" target="_blank">00:55:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the, let's make it a little smaller so we can see better, we've got the horizontal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3312" target="_blank">00:55:12.680</a></span> | <span class="t">edges channel and the vertical edges channel. And we'd have a similar thing in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3317" target="_blank">00:55:17.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the first layer of its color.

So now our, our filter, this has got the filter, this little mini matrix</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3331" target="_blank">00:55:31.560</a></span> | <span class="t">has got the filter. Our filter,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3344" target="_blank">00:55:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">our filter now contains a 3 by 3 by depth 2, or if you want to think of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3352" target="_blank">00:55:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">another way, 2 3 by 3 kernels, or 1 3 by 3 by 2 kernel. And we basically do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3359" target="_blank">00:55:59.200</a></span> | <span class="t">exactly the same thing, which is we're going to multiply each of these by each</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3364" target="_blank">00:56:04.120</a></span> | <span class="t">of these and sum them up. But then we do it for the second bit as well, we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3369" target="_blank">00:56:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">multiply each of these by each of these and sum them up. And so that gives us, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3377" target="_blank">00:56:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">then I think I just picked some random numbers here, right? So this is going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3380" target="_blank">00:56:20.560</a></span> | <span class="t">now be something which can combine, oh sorry, the second one, the second set, so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3385" target="_blank">00:56:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">it's, sorry, each of the red ones by each of the blue ones, that's here, plus each</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3392" target="_blank">00:56:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">of the green ones times each of the mauve ones, that's here. So this first filter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3398" target="_blank">00:56:38.200</a></span> | <span class="t">is being applied to the horizontal edge detector and the second filter is being</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3403" target="_blank">00:56:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">applied to the vertical edge detector.

So in this case</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3466" target="_blank">00:57:46.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I manually put in the numbers I knew would create edge detectors.

And then the other thing that we do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3727" target="_blank">01:02:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">differently is nowadays we don't normally have a single dense layer at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3734" target="_blank">01:02:14.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the end, a single matrix multiply at the end. But instead what we do, we generally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3739" target="_blank">01:02:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">keep doing stride two convolutions. So each one's going to reduce the grid size</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3743" target="_blank">01:02:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">by two by two. We keep going down until we've got about a seven by seven grid. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3750" target="_blank">01:02:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">then we do a single pooling at the end. And we don't normally do max pool</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3755" target="_blank">01:02:35.080</a></span> | <span class="t">nowadays. Instead we do an average pool. So we average the the activations of each</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3763" target="_blank">01:02:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">one of the seven by seven features. This is actually quite important to know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3769" target="_blank">01:02:49.160</a></span> | <span class="t">because if you think about what that means, it means that something like an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3774" target="_blank">01:02:54.840</a></span> | <span class="t">ImageNet style image detector is going to end up with a seven by seven grid.

Is there a bear</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3789" target="_blank">01:03:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">in this part of the photo? Is there a bear in this part of the photo?

And so this is where like the details of how we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3836" target="_blank">01:03:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">construct our model turn out to be important. And so if you're trying to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3842" target="_blank">01:04:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">find like just one part of a photo that has a small bear in it, you might decide</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3849" target="_blank">01:04:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">to use maximum pooling instead of average pooling. Because max</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3853" target="_blank">01:04:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">pooling will just say, "I think this is a picture of a bear if any one of those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3857" target="_blank">01:04:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">49 bits of my grid has something that looks like a bear in it." So these are, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3865" target="_blank">01:04:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">know, these are potentially important details which often get hand-waved over.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3873" target="_blank">01:04:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Although, you know, again, like the key thing here is that this is happening</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3882" target="_blank">01:04:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">right at the very end, right? That max pool or that average pool. And actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3886" target="_blank">01:04:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">FastAI handles this for you. We do a special thing which we kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3891" target="_blank">01:04:51.160</a></span> | <span class="t">independently invented. I think we did it first, which is we do both max pool and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3896" target="_blank">01:04:56.440</a></span> | <span class="t">average pool and we concatenate them together. We call that concat pooling. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3900" target="_blank">01:05:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">that has since been reinvented in at least one paper. And so that means that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3908" target="_blank">01:05:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">you don't have to think too much about it because we're going to try both for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3911" target="_blank">01:05:11.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you basically. So I mentioned that this is actually really just matrix</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3919" target="_blank">01:05:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">multiplication. And to show you that, I'm going to show you some images created by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3928" target="_blank">01:05:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">a guy called Matthew Kline-Smith who did this actually, I think this is the now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3931" target="_blank">01:05:31.720</a></span> | <span class="t">very first ever course, might have been the part two, first part two course. And he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3939" target="_blank">01:05:39.720</a></span> | <span class="t">basically pointed out that in a certain way of thinking about it, it turns out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3944" target="_blank">01:05:44.520</a></span> | <span class="t">that convolution is the same thing as a matrix multiplier. So I want to show you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3949" target="_blank">01:05:49.320</a></span> | <span class="t">how he shows this. He basically says, "Okay, let's take this 3x3 image and a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3956" target="_blank">01:05:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">2x2 kernel containing the coefficients alpha, beta, gamma, delta." And so in this, as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3966" target="_blank">01:06:06.760</a></span> | <span class="t">we slide the window over, each of the colors, each of the colors are multiplied</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3976" target="_blank">01:06:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">together, red by red plus green by green plus, what is that, orange by orange plus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3980" target="_blank">01:06:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">blue by blue gives you this. And so to put it another way,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3984" target="_blank">01:06:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">algebraically P equals alpha times A plus beta times B, etc. And so then as we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=3997" target="_blank">01:06:37.800</a></span> | <span class="t">slide to this part, we're multiplying again, red by red, green by green, and so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=4002" target="_blank">01:06:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">forth. So we can say Q equals alpha times B plus beta times C, etc. And so this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=4008" target="_blank">01:06:48.600</a></span> | <span class="t">how we calculate a convolution using the approach we just described as a sliding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=4013" target="_blank">01:06:53.560</a></span> | <span class="t">window. But here's another way of thinking about it. We could say, "Okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=4024" target="_blank">01:07:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">we've got all these different things, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J. Let's put them all into a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=4032" target="_blank">01:07:12.120</a></span> | <span class="t">single vector and then let's create a single matrix that has alpha, alpha, alpha,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=4040" target="_blank">01:07:20.680</a></span> | <span class="t">alpha, beta, beta, beta, beta, etc. And then if we do this matrix multiplied by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=4047" target="_blank">01:07:27.560</a></span> | <span class="t">this vector, we get this with these gray zeros in the appropriate places, which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=4057" target="_blank">01:07:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">gives us this, which is the same as this. And so this shows that a convolution is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=4067" target="_blank">01:07:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">actually a special kind of matrix multiplication. It's a matrix</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=4071" target="_blank">01:07:51.240</a></span> | <span class="t">multiplication where there are some zeros that are fixed and some numbers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=4075" target="_blank">01:07:55.800</a></span> | <span class="t">that are forced to be the same. Now in practice it's going to be faster to do it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=4082" target="_blank">01:08:02.560</a></span> | <span class="t">this way, but it's a useful kind of thing to think about, I think, that just to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=4088" target="_blank">01:08:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">realize like, "Oh, it's just another of these special types of matrix</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=4092" target="_blank">01:08:12.920</a></span> | <span class="t">multiplications." Okay, I think, well let's look at one more thing because there was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=4111" target="_blank">01:08:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">one other thing that we saw and I mentioned we would look at in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=4114" target="_blank">01:08:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">tabular model, which is called dropout. And I actually have this in my Excel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=4119" target="_blank">01:08:39.880</a></span> | <span class="t">spreadsheet. If you go to the conv example dropout page, you'll see we've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=4132" target="_blank">01:08:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">actually got a little bit more stuff here. We've got the same input as before</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=4135" target="_blank">01:08:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and the same first convolution as before and the same second convolution as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=4140" target="_blank">01:09:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">before. And then we've got a bunch of random numbers. They're showing as between</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=4154" target="_blank">01:09:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">0 and 1, but they're actually, that's just because they're rounding off, they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=4157" target="_blank">01:09:17.880</a></span> | <span class="t">actually random numbers that are floats between 0 and 1. Over here, we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=4170" target="_blank">01:09:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">then saying, "If..." Let's have a look. So way up here, I'll zoom in a bit, I've got a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=4187" target="_blank">01:09:47.720</a></span> | <span class="t">dropout factor. Let's change this say to 0.5. There we go. So over here, this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=4196" target="_blank">01:09:56.760</a></span> | <span class="t">something that says if the random number in the equivalent place is greater than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=4203" target="_blank">01:10:03.080</a></span> | <span class="t">0.5, then 1, otherwise 0. And so here's a whole bunch of 1s and 0s. Now this thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=4210" target="_blank">01:10:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">here is called a dropout mask. Now what happens is we multiply over here, we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=4220" target="_blank">01:10:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">multiply the dropout mask and we multiply it by our filtered image. And what that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=4228" target="_blank">01:10:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">means is we end up with exactly the same image we started with. Here's the image</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=4235" target="_blank">01:10:35.160</a></span> | <span class="t">we started with, but it's corrupted. Random bits of it have been deleted. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=4242" target="_blank">01:10:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">based on the amount of dropout we use, so if we change it to say 0.2, not very much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=4250" target="_blank">01:10:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">if it's deleted at all, so it's still very easy to recognize. Or else if we use lots</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=4255" target="_blank">01:10:55.080</a></span> | <span class="t">of dropout, say 0.8, it's almost impossible to see what the number was. And then we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=4264" target="_blank">01:11:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">use this as the input to the next layer. So that seems weird. Why would we delete</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=4273" target="_blank">01:11:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">some data at random from our processed image from our activations after a layer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=4282" target="_blank">01:11:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">of the convolutions? Well the reason is that a human is able to look at this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=4289" target="_blank">01:11:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">corrupted image and still recognize it's a seven.

It used to be kind of dull,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=4943" target="_blank">01:22:23.080</a></span> | <span class="t">but then there's only basically five labs in the world working on neural nets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=4947" target="_blank">01:22:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And yeah, from time to time, you know, take a dip into other areas that maybe you're not following</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=4955" target="_blank">01:22:35.880</a></span> | <span class="t">as closely.

I get that a lot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=5044" target="_blank">01:24:04.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But interestingly, you know, I've been teaching people machine learning and data science stuff</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=5053" target="_blank">01:24:13.560</a></span> | <span class="t">for nearly 30 years. And I've had a variation of this question throughout. And the reason is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=5062" target="_blank">01:24:22.760</a></span> | <span class="t">engineers always want to push the envelope in like the on the biggest computers they can find,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=5070" target="_blank">01:24:30.760</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, that's just this, like, fun thing engineers love to do.

And so, you know, when you look at fast ai's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=5104" target="_blank">01:25:04.360</a></span> | <span class="t">dawn bench success, when we trained image net faster than anybody had trained it before,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=5111" target="_blank">01:25:11.240</a></span> | <span class="t">on standard GPUs, you know, me and a bunch of students, that was not meant to happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=5118" target="_blank">01:25:18.440</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, Google was working very hard with their TPU introduction to try to show how good they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=5123" target="_blank">01:25:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">were.

But if you pick areas in different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=5165" target="_blank">01:26:05.640</a></span> | <span class="t">domains, you know, there's still huge areas where much smaller models are still going to be state</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=5173" target="_blank">01:26:13.960</a></span> | <span class="t">of the art. So hopefully that helped answer your question. Let's see what else we got here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=5182" target="_blank">01:26:22.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So Daniel has obviously been following my journey with teaching my daughter math. Yeah, he's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=5193" target="_blank">01:26:33.960</a></span> | <span class="t">so I homeschool my daughter.

But yeah, we should talk about this more at some point. All right, let's see what else</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=5302" target="_blank">01:28:22.120</a></span> | <span class="t">we've got here.

I spend probably less hours</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=5601" target="_blank">01:33:21.400</a></span> | <span class="t">a day working than most people, I would guess. But I think I do a couple of things differently</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=5608" target="_blank">01:33:28.120</a></span> | <span class="t">when I'm working. One is I've spent half, at least half of every working day since I was about 18,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=5617" target="_blank">01:33:37.080</a></span> | <span class="t">learning or practicing something new. Could be a new language, could be a new algorithm,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=5625" target="_blank">01:33:45.080</a></span> | <span class="t">could be something I read about. And nearly all of that time, therefore, I've been doing that thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=5633" target="_blank">01:33:53.160</a></span> | <span class="t">more slowly than I would if I just used something I already knew.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=5638" target="_blank">01:33:58.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Which often drives my co-workers crazy, because they're like, you know, why aren't you focusing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=5647" target="_blank">01:34:07.080</a></span> | <span class="t">on getting that thing done? But in the other 50% of the time, I'm constantly, you know, building up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=5654" target="_blank">01:34:14.600</a></span> | <span class="t">this kind of exponentially improving base of expertise in a wide range of areas. And so now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=5661" target="_blank">01:34:21.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I do find, you know, I can do things, often orders of magnitude faster than people around me, or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=5671" target="_blank">01:34:31.160</a></span> | <span class="t">certainly many multiples faster than people around me, because I, you know, know a whole bunch of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=5676" target="_blank">01:34:36.280</a></span> | <span class="t">tools and skills and ideas which, yeah, no, other people don't necessarily know. So like, I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=5683" target="_blank">01:34:43.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that's one thing that's been helpful. And then another is, yeah, like trying to really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=5687" target="_blank">01:34:47.160</a></span> | <span class="t">not overdo things, like get good sleep and eat well and exercise well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=5693" target="_blank">01:34:53.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And also, I think it's a case of like tenacity, you know, I've noticed a lot of people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=5704" target="_blank">01:35:04.280</a></span> | <span class="t">give up much earlier than I do. So, yeah, if you just keep going until something's actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=5715" target="_blank">01:35:15.640</a></span> | <span class="t">finished, then that's going to put you in a small minority, to be honest. Most people don't do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=5723" target="_blank">01:35:23.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And when I say finished, like finish something really nicely. And I try to make it like, so I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=5728" target="_blank">01:35:28.840</a></span> | <span class="t">particularly like coding, and so I try to do a lot of coding related stuff. So I create things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=5733" target="_blank">01:35:33.880</a></span> | <span class="t">like NBDev, and NBDev makes it much, much easier for me to finish something nicely, you know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=5740" target="_blank">01:35:40.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So in my kind of chosen area, I've spent quite a bit of time trying to make sure it's really easy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=5747" target="_blank">01:35:47.400</a></span> | <span class="t">for me to like, get out a blog post, get out a Python library, get out a notebook analysis,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=5753" target="_blank">01:35:53.560</a></span> | <span class="t">whatever. So, yeah, trying to make these things I want to do easier, and so then I'll do them more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiNBPxcXgo&t=5761" target="_blank">01:36:01.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So, well, thank you, everybody.
