href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=0" target="_blank">00:00:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's great to meet you, I'm Asaf, and today I'm going to talk to you about how we're building our digital workforce at monday.com.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=17" target="_blank">00:00:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So very quickly about myself, I'm the head of AI at Monday, I'm a scout for Sequoia, I currently live in Israel, so I'm super jet-lagged right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=27" target="_blank">00:00:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And I've also been building AI products for the past decade, including some you may know, like GPT Researcher and Tavili.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=32" target="_blank">00:00:32.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So monday.com, maybe some of you know a bit about them, but basically we're a public company, we basically build a workOS where you can manage and do all your work in one single platform, rather your CRM, dev, service, work management.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=51" target="_blank">00:00:51.620</a></span> | <span class="t">We've actually crossed $1 billion ARR just this year, and there's one important fact here that I think is worth noting, and it's that we're actually processing around 1 billion tasks per year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=64" target="_blank">00:01:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And I want to just think about this for a second, because when you think about 1 billion tasks, work tasks per year, just think about the opportunity for agents and AI that can actually take on those tasks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is a huge opportunity that we see at Monday when we think about AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=83" target="_blank">00:01:23.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And we've actually launched our first AI feature around September last year, and we've seen insane hypergrowth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.520</a></span> | <span class="t">We've been growing 100% month over month with our AI usage, and just recently we launched our digital workforce.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=101" target="_blank">00:01:41.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So when you think about what is our digital workforce, think about agents working around the clock.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Whether you're an SMB looking to scale up, or an enterprise, imagine agents working within the Monday ecosystem on any given task you can think of.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=124" target="_blank">00:02:04.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And what I'm going to show you today is very powerful lessons learned that we had in our experience building agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was said earlier here today by the Harvey team, and I think others, that to build very successful agents, you have to focus on product and user experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And we have a saying it Monday, that the biggest barrier to adoption is trust.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It's actually not technology.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And I want to show you a few examples of things that we've learned.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So when we think about autonomy, I think we're all engineers, and we love to think about autonomous agents, and agents doing everything around the clock.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.240</a></span> | <span class="t">But actually, the opposite is true.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.720</a></span> | <span class="t">When we see how our users are using agents and what they think, imagine that every company, every user, has a different risk appetite.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And when you build AI agents, you should give users that control.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And what we've learned by applying this is that we've actually increased adoption in a sane way, by giving the control in the user's hand to decide how they want to control their agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Secondly, is entry points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, if you're building a startup from scratch, that's something else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But as a huge company like Monday, one thing that we've learned is don't rebuild a new user experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Try to think how you can create these experiences within your existing products.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So when you think about how agents can work at Monday, we already have people working at Monday, on Monday.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.420</a></span> | <span class="t">We just assign people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So we can do the same with agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Just think about how you can just assign digital workers or agents to actual tasks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And by doing that, our users have no new habits that they have to learn.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.040</a></span> | <span class="t">It's seamless within their experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Another super important thing that we've learned.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So originally, when we released those agents, imagine that you can ask in the chat and say things like, create this board, create this project, modify this item.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.940</a></span> | <span class="t">For our users, Monday boards are production data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I think a very good example I'd like to give is think about Cursor AI, which is an amazing product.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.280</a></span> | <span class="t">We all vibe code, as Andrew and G said earlier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But imagine that with Cursor AI, instead of you as developers seeing the code, imagine it was pushed straight to production.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I assume that none of you, or maybe most of you, would have not used it, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And that is just how important user experience is versus technology.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Because technologically-wise, we could do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Cursor could have done that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And what we did is that we saw users onboarding, testing them out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And once came the time to actually push content to the board, that's where they froze.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So we introduced a preview, and this preview increased adoption by insane, because users now have the confidence that they know what's going to have this guardrail before they actually save.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And they know what's going to be the outputs before they see it saved.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So when you think about building AI experiences, think about previews, think about UB in the loop, think about how users can have that control and understanding before AI releases to production.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And lastly is explainability.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=348" target="_blank">00:05:48.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, explainability, we've heard a lot, and it feels, I think, when I talk with people, it kind of feels like a nice-to-have, but explainability is much more than that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=358" target="_blank">00:05:58.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Think about explainability as a way for your users to learn how to improve their experience with the AI over time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Because when they have an understanding of why the outputs happened, they have an ability to change the outcomes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So these four are super-important components that we've actually introduced in our product that have increased adoption very, very nicely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=385" target="_blank">00:06:25.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Now let's talk about the tech.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So we actually built our entire ecosystem of our agents on LangRath and LangSmith.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And we've tested out various frameworks, and we found LangRath to be the number one by far.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=404" target="_blank">00:06:44.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And just a few examples, so what's great about LangRath is that it's not really opinionated, but it still does everything you don't want to deal with as an engineer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=415" target="_blank">00:06:55.740</a></span> | <span class="t">like interrupts and checkpoints, persistent memory, you mean the loop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Those are critical components that we don't want to deal with, but we have that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=427" target="_blank">00:07:07.340</a></span> | <span class="t">On the other hand, we have super great options to customize it just for what we need, and we'll show you an example in one second.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=435" target="_blank">00:07:15.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And additionally, native integration, we now process millions of requests per month using LangRath, and it's proven to be super scalable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=449" target="_blank">00:07:29.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's take a look at how this is behind the hood.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=452" target="_blank">00:07:32.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have LangRath as the center of everything we're building.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=456" target="_blank">00:07:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And around our LangRath engine, which uses also LangRath and LangSmith for monitoring,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=463" target="_blank">00:07:43.080</a></span> | <span class="t">we also have what we have built as what we call AI blocks, which is basically internal AI actions that we've developed at Monday.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=471" target="_blank">00:07:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">We've actually built our own evaluation framework, because we believe that evaluation is one of the most important aspects when you're building AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=478" target="_blank">00:07:58.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think today was a lot about evaluations, as you've guys seen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=482" target="_blank">00:08:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm not going to dive into that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=483" target="_blank">00:08:03.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we also have our AI gateway, which is our way of preserving what kind of inputs and outputs are enabled in the system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=493" target="_blank">00:08:13.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Now let's take an example of our first digital worker that we released, which is the Monday Expert.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=501" target="_blank">00:08:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So basically what you see here is a conversational agent using the supervisor methodology that the system holds four different agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=515" target="_blank">00:08:35.220</a></span> | <span class="t">We have a supervisor, we have a data retrieval agent, which is in charge of retrieving all data across Monday.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=521" target="_blank">00:08:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">For example, knowledge base, board data, we also use web search.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=527" target="_blank">00:08:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Then we have our board actions agent, that does actual actions on Monday.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=533" target="_blank">00:08:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And last, we have the answer composer, that based on the user, the past conversations, tone of voice,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=541" target="_blank">00:09:01.940</a></span> | <span class="t">and all kind of other parameters that are defined by the Monday user, actually composes the final answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=549" target="_blank">00:09:09.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And we've even added a really awesome tool that we've learned, which is called undo.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=554" target="_blank">00:09:14.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So basically, we give the supervisor the ability to dynamically decide what to undo within the actions based on the user feedback.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=564" target="_blank">00:09:24.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Which is, by the way, which is, by the way, proved to be one of the coolest use cases for building.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=571" target="_blank">00:09:31.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And I want to share a bit of our lessons learned as we built this agent and what we're seeing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=578" target="_blank">00:09:38.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So, when you're building conversational agents, assume that 99% of user interactions you're not going to know how to handle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=590" target="_blank">00:09:50.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's proven statistically, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=593" target="_blank">00:09:53.560</a></span> | <span class="t">When you think about the infinite amount of things users can ask, probably you've only handled 1%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=600" target="_blank">00:10:00.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And for this, we learned to start with a fallback.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=606" target="_blank">00:10:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">What happens in the 99% of interactions that we don't know how to handle?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=610" target="_blank">00:10:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So, for example, what we did was, if we detect and the user is asking some action that we don't know how to handle,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=618" target="_blank">00:10:18.540</a></span> | <span class="t">we would search our knowledge base and give them an answer for how they can do it themselves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=623" target="_blank">00:10:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Just an example of one way of resolving fallback.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=626" target="_blank">00:10:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Evals, we've talked so much today, so I'm not going to dive into it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=632" target="_blank">00:10:32.100</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think the bottom line with evals is that evals are your IP.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=634" target="_blank">00:10:34.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Because models change.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=636" target="_blank">00:10:36.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Technology is going to change so much over the next few years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=640" target="_blank">00:10:40.500</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you have very strong evaluation, that is your IP.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=644" target="_blank">00:10:44.940</a></span> | <span class="t">That will allow you to move much faster than your competitors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=647" target="_blank">00:10:47.960</a></span> | <span class="t">You mean the loop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=650" target="_blank">00:10:50.840</a></span> | <span

this a lot at the beginning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=654" target="_blank">00:10:54.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I think, for those who have really shipped AI to production,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=660" target="_blank">00:11:00.820</a></span> | <span class="t">I think you've seen that it's one thing to bring AI to 80%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=665" target="_blank">00:11:05.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But then it takes another year to get to 99%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=670" target="_blank">00:11:10.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is a very important rule, because we really felt confident when we were working locally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=677" target="_blank">00:11:17.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And once we shipped to production, we realized how far we are from an actual product.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=682" target="_blank">00:11:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I can see some of the audience resonate with me on that one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=690" target="_blank">00:11:30.300</a></span> | <span class="t">All guardrails, we highly recommend that you build outside the LLM.</span></div><div

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=696" target="_blank">00:11:36.520</a></span> | <span class="t">We've seen things like LLM as a judge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=698" target="_blank">00:11:38.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Even back to the cursor idea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=700" target="_blank">00:11:40.660</a></span> | <span class="t">By the way, I think cursor is such a great example for a way to build a good product experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=706" target="_blank">00:11:46.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Because I don't know if you guys, especially with Vibe Coding, after 25 runs, it stops.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=710" target="_blank">00:11:50.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=711" target="_blank">00:11:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">This is an external guardrail they put in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=713" target="_blank">00:11:53.480</a></span> | <span class="t">No matter if it's actually running successful.</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=717" target="_blank">00:11:57.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So just think about how you can create those guardrails outside the LLM.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=722" target="_blank">00:12:02.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And then lastly, and this is a very interesting one, is that it might be obvious that it's smart</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=731" target="_blank">00:12:11.420</a></span> | <span class="t">to break your agent into sub-agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=734" target="_blank">00:12:14.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Obviously, when you have specialized agents they work better, but what we've learned is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=740" target="_blank">00:12:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that there is a very important balance because when you have too many agents, what happens</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=747" target="_blank">00:12:27.180</a></span> | <span class="t">is what we like to call compound hallucination.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=751" target="_blank">00:12:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So basically, it's a mathematic problem, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=755" target="_blank">00:12:35.780</a></span> | <span class="t">90% accuracy times a 90% accuracy second agent times a third times a fourth, even if they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=761" target="_blank">00:12:41.940</a></span> | <span class="t">all at 90%, you're now at 70%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=765"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=769" target="_blank">00:12:49.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think there's a very strong balance between how much of agents you want in your multi-agent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=776" target="_blank">00:12:56.300</a></span> | <span class="t">system versus having too much or too little.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=779" target="_blank">00:12:59.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's something that I think there is no rule of thumb, it's something you have to iterate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=783" target="_blank">00:13:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">on based on your use case.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=787" target="_blank">00:13:07.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's talk about the future of work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=791" target="_blank">00:13:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And we believe that the future of work, as what we're working on at Monday, is all about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=801" target="_blank">00:13:21.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is a real use case that we try to work on internally.</span></div><div

this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=841" target="_blank">00:14:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And the problem is that it will only run once a quarter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ewpJrZVwo&t=847" target="_blank">00:14:07.740</a></span> | <span class="t">We invest the
