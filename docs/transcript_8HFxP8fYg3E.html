If your phone number is stolen as a result of a SIM swap, which is not as difficult as one would think, for a few bucks, unfortunately, people call people at mobile providers and get them to switch things based on the fact that they go, "I'm sorry.</p><p>I forgot my password. This is my phone number, and I just got a new device, by the way, so can you please transfer to my new device?" And then, all of a sudden, you don't get the code. We've had cases where people have lost millions in cryptocurrency because the code was sent to the phone number that had been stolen by a hacker.</p></div></div></body></html>
