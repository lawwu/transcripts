But I'm not just a product guy. I'm coding for like 20, 80 years</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=30" target="_blank">00:00:30.740</a></span> | <span class="t">from my very early age, like when I was nine, I can't remember. But for AI, actually, I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=36" target="_blank">00:00:36.680</a></span> | <span class="t">very newbie. I've just been into this industry for only two years. And what I want to achieve</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=43" target="_blank">00:00:43.820</a></span> | <span class="t">in the AI industry is I want to build a product that can influence 24 hours for a single user.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=51" target="_blank">00:00:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">That is two years ago. It is my dream. But right now, I think with Manus AI, actually, I can achieve</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=56" target="_blank">00:00:56.700</a></span> | <span class="t">that dream at end of this year. Right now, the maximum usage for our user, there is one single</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=63" target="_blank">00:01:03.240</a></span> | <span class="t">user. He can just consume the GPU power two hours per day just for himself. So I think we can achieve</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=71" target="_blank">00:01:11.720</a></span> | <span class="t">this goal at end of this year. And today, what I want to talk about is about two things. One is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.180</a></span> | <span class="t">about Manus. Another thing is about cloud models. So the first talk is about what is Manus. Yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Manus actually, you know, it's not like an English word. Because really, it isn't. Yeah. Manus,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.260</a></span> | <span class="t">this just comes from MIT's motto, which is Manus at Manus. It's an old Latin word, which means</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=97" target="_blank">00:01:37.660</a></span> | <span class="t">man and hand. Why we choose this name Manus. Manus is the hand. It's because we think for like all the past</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.780</a></span> | <span class="t">two years, all these frontier models, they already like very smart, just like a human's brain. Yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.740</a></span> | <span class="t">they're super smart. They are capable of like doing different kind of tasks. But you know, even with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.300</a></span> | <span class="t">this very, very smart brain, we can make a real impact into a real world because we don't build hands for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.940</a></span> | <span class="t">things. You know, just like when I was nine, at that time, that is like 1996, back in China. And at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.140</a></span> | <span class="t">that time, our families are not, you know, we're not rich enough to have a computer in each of our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=138" target="_blank">00:02:18.180</a></span> | <span class="t">family. So I only have like two times a week to go to the computer room in my primary school. And at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.460</a></span> | <span class="t">that time, even I was the best in the class of coding. But without going to the computer room to like debug,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.940</a></span> | <span class="t">to write the code on the real machine, I can't get the code right just in one time with a pen and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.060</a></span> | <span class="t">the paper. But you know, that's exactly what we did for the past two years. We have a very smart man,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.940</a></span> | <span class="t">but we only give it a pen and a paper. And we ask them to solve very complex problems for us. So we think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.380</a></span> | <span class="t">that's our problem. So in Manus, we don't train models. We don't even like post-train fine-tuning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.380</a></span> | <span class="t">models. What we do is like we are building hands for these models. Yeah, that is, you know, the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.340</a></span> | <span class="t">concept behind our lane, Manus. Yeah. I think like most of you maybe saw our product Manus on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.620</a></span> | <span class="t">social net or you've already a Manus user and you must like saw some use cases on our website,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.540</a></span> | <span class="t">any like social network. But today, I also want to like just share like two new use cases, one from our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.140</a></span> | <span class="t">internal usage, another is from our user. Yeah. So this one is actually from our internal usage. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Because we are expanding globally. We just opened our Singapore office three weeks ago and opened our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Tokyo office two weeks ago and we will open our San Francisco office tomorrow. Yeah. So when we are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.820</a></span> | <span class="t">choosing our Tokyo office, we are asking Manus to help us. It's like we're going to say, okay, we have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.380</a></span> | <span class="t">like 40 people. We will be relocating to Tokyo. So just find the office which can fit 40 people. And also,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.900</a></span> | <span class="t">we have to solve their accommodation problem. So this is a prompt we give to Manus. And after we give this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.420</a></span> | <span class="t">problem to Manus, Manus just have its own plan and then executes the plan. It's like search,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.140</a></span> | <span class="t">browse all these websites around the internet, doing a lot of browsing, browsing, browsing, research,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.060</a></span> | <span class="t">research, research. And after 24 minutes, Manus just delivers this website for us. Yeah, this website.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.620</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a Tokyo office accommodation recommendations. It first that it comes with a very interactive map,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.500</a></span> | <span class="t">which comes with all the 10 options Manus found for us. The blue marker is for the office's location. And the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.220</a></span> | <span class="t">green marker is the accommodation near that office. All these 10 options just on this interactive map. Yeah. And if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.220</a></span> | <span class="t">you keep scrolling down, you can see the first pair is a Shibuya one. It choose the Shibuya Scramble Square. That's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.020</a></span> | <span class="t">exactly the office we went to when we are looking at the office there. But you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.660</a></span> | <span class="t">this office is kind of like very fancy, but too expensive for startup like us. So we just choose our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.500</a></span> | <span class="t">office near this one, very, very close, like maybe 200 meters away. And it has the price and why we should</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.580</a></span> | <span class="t">choose this office. And if you choose this office, what is accommodation options we could get? Also has the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.020</a></span> | <span class="t">distance to the office, which is very great. Comes with like 10 pairs of the, and at the bottom, there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.740</a></span> | <span class="t">like an overview table for all these options. Yeah. So all these have been done just under 20 minutes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can imagine maybe like your intern or your assistant can achieve such detailed quantity of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.740</a></span> | <span class="t">information in such a short time. Another thing I want to demo here is like, yeah, you can just maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=353" target="_blank">00:05:53.700</a></span> | <span class="t">send an image to Manus, an empty rule, and ask Manus to analyze this rule's style and go to EKS</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.660</a></span> | <span class="t">website to find some furnitures for your rule. And then you can see the final result. Yeah. So look,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=367" target="_blank">00:06:07.460</a></span> | <span class="t">first Manus will just analyze this empty rule's image and come up with the idea, okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=373" target="_blank">00:06:13.540</a></span> | <span class="t">this, what style of this rule and the layout and what kind of furnitures I should look up in the EKS</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=382" target="_blank">00:06:22.260</a></span> | <span class="t">website. And then Manus just go to EKS website and start browsing, browsing for all these furnitures</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=389" target="_blank">00:06:29.140</a></span> | <span class="t">and save these furnitures images. And then at last Manus will just return an image just with the real EKS</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=398" target="_blank">00:06:38.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So actually you can just click the link to buy it. Yeah. Right now we can't buy things for you. But who knows,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=413" target="_blank">00:06:53.620</a></span> | <span class="t">after three months, yeah, maybe we can do payment. Yeah. So that is kind of the things Manus can do. Yeah. It's like a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=420" target="_blank">00:07:00.900</a></span> | <span class="t">general agent. Yeah. They can solve a very long tail of different type of tasks for you. Yeah. So we can jump back to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=428" target="_blank">00:07:08.580</a></span> | <span class="t">slides. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=430" target="_blank">00:07:10.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So that is like kind of like what is Manus. And today, I think the most I want to share is like how we built Manus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=437" target="_blank">00:07:17.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Cursor just inspired us a lot. We got a lot of inspirations from Cursor. I think you may sound weird,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=444" target="_blank">00:07:24.340</a></span> | <span class="t">because Cursor is kind of like a code editor, you know. Yeah. So all three founders of Manus,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=449" target="_blank">00:07:29.700</a></span> | <span class="t">like Pig, Red, and I, were all coders for a lot of years. So when we are using Cursor, I think Cursor is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=454" target="_blank">00:07:34.900</a></span> | <span class="t">actually a very great product. It can help us to write different language even we don't know how to code in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=461" target="_blank">00:07:41.300</a></span> | <span class="t">this language. And it's very like efficiency. But the most interesting part is not way coders using Cursor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=470" target="_blank">00:07:50.580</a></span> | <span class="t">The most interesting part is when we watch our friends, our colleagues, which are long coders,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=477" target="_blank">00:07:57.060</a></span> | <span class="t">watching they using Cursor to solve their daily tasks like doing data visualization, batch file processing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=484" target="_blank">00:08:04.100</a></span> | <span class="t">convert a video file into an audio file. It's very fascinating because, you know, this is the interface</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=490" target="_blank">00:08:10.340</a></span> | <span class="t">of Cursor, right? When these long coders using Cursor, they don't care about the left side because they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=497" target="_blank">00:08:17.220</a></span> | <span class="t">they can't evaluate the code at all. All they can do is just to keep the accept, accept, accept,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=503" target="_blank">00:08:23.700</a></span> | <span class="t">accept, accept, accept, you know. Yeah. So it's very interesting when watching those friends, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.940</a></span> | <span class="t">using Cursor. So we just come up with the idea, which is that those long programmers just using Cursor to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=517" target="_blank">00:08:37.140</a></span> | <span class="t">deal with their daily tasks. Yeah, not like us. You know, when we are using Cursor, we really want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=523" target="_blank">00:08:43.620</a></span> | <span class="t">write some code, you know, that can run multiple times for the future. But for these friends, they just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=529" target="_blank">00:08:49.940</a></span> | <span class="t">want Cursor to solve their task. They don't care about the code. Next time, when they have the same task,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=535" target="_blank">00:08:55.140</a></span> | <span class="t">they will not run that code again. They will just ask Cursor to do that, maybe generate a new code for them. So code is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=542" target="_blank">00:09:02.340</a></span> | <span class="t">like maybe not the ultimate goal. It's just, you know, just an intermediate step for solving programs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=548" target="_blank">00:09:08.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So we come up with the idea that maybe we should build the opposite. Yeah, we should build the right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=554" target="_blank">00:09:14.900</a></span> | <span class="t">panel of Cursor. And another thing we want to build is that we want the right panel to run in the cloud.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=561" target="_blank">00:09:21.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Why is that? Because, you know, when we are using Cursor on our computer, there's, it has to ask your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=568" target="_blank">00:09:28.820</a></span> | <span class="t">permission to continue because it is running on your computer. Any action it performs on your computer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=576" target="_blank">00:09:36.020</a></span> | <span class="t">is like, well, maybe dangerous, right? After it, maybe it will install some dependencies, install some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=582" target="_blank">00:09:42.500</a></span> | <span class="t">software. It may break your computer. But we think if it's running in the cloud, it's much safer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=590" target="_blank">00:09:50.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And also, when it's running in the cloud, you don't have to pay your attention to it. You just, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=596" target="_blank">00:09:56.820</a></span> | <span class="t">assign a task to Manus. You can just close your laptop or just put your phone back to your pocket.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=602" target="_blank">00:10:02.500</a></span> | <span class="t">You can do other thing. And after the task is done, we will give you a notification and you will get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=607" target="_blank">00:10:07.540</a></span> | <span class="t">the result. Yeah. So that's the original idea of how we come up with the idea of the Manus that is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=616" target="_blank">00:10:16.020</a></span> | <span class="t">happening last October. So from last October to this March, five months of work, this is what you saw</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=624" target="_blank">00:10:24.340</a></span> | <span class="t">today, which is the Manus AI in the fifth of March. Yeah. So that's the original idea. Yeah. Thank you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=631" target="_blank">00:10:31.140</a></span> | <span class="t">guys. And also, I want to share some details. When we're building Manus, what kind of thoughts we have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=636" target="_blank">00:10:36.740</a></span> | <span class="t">in our mind? The first thing is that the first key component of Manus is that we give Manus a computer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=643" target="_blank">00:10:43.460</a></span> | <span class="t">which is super important when you compare it to other chatbot usage. Because, you know, you Manus,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=649" target="_blank">00:10:49.380</a></span> | <span class="t">each Manus tag will be assigned a fully functioned virtual machine. Manus can use the file system,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=655" target="_blank">00:10:55.540</a></span> | <span class="t">terminal, VSCO, and a real Chromium browser. You know, it's not a headless browser. Yeah. All these apps in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=663" target="_blank">00:11:03.220</a></span> | <span class="t">virtual machine, which, you know, it creates a lot of different opportunity for Manus to solve different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=669" target="_blank">00:11:09.140</a></span> | <span class="t">kinds of problems. Like, you can just send a zip compress file, contains maybe hundreds of PDFs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=677" target="_blank">00:11:17.540</a></span> | <span class="t">and ask Manus to unzip it, and then extract all these unstructured data from these hundreds of PDFs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=686" target="_blank">00:11:26.260</a></span> | <span class="t">into a structured spreadsheet. Yeah. That's the thing you can do. So we think, give it a computer is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=691" target="_blank">00:11:31.940</a></span> | <span class="t">actually what makes Manus really different compared to other agents or other chatbots. And the second</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=698" target="_blank">00:11:38.660</a></span> | <span class="t">thing is that we think, you know, nowadays, it's not every information or data is on the public internet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=704" target="_blank">00:11:44.740</a></span> | <span class="t">There are so many things behind the pay or in these private databases. But users, because Manus, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=711" target="_blank">00:11:51.380</a></span> | <span class="t">we are targeting to the consumer market. We're not targeting to the enterprise market. So for an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=716" target="_blank">00:11:56.420</a></span> | <span class="t">average user, who is not very familiar of how to call an API, you know, how to write code to access</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=722" target="_blank">00:12:02.820</a></span> | <span class="t">databases, we think it's better for us to prepay all these, like, private databases, APIs for the users.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=730" target="_blank">00:12:10.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Then users won't care how they can get maybe some real-time financial data. Yeah, things like that. So it's like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=736" target="_blank">00:12:16.660</a></span> | <span class="t">we prepaid these private databases for our users. And the third thing is that, in Manus actually,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=743" target="_blank">00:12:23.300</a></span> | <span class="t">you can just teach Manus how to solve programs. Like, one month before we released Manus, ChatGPT just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=751" target="_blank">00:12:31.140</a></span> | <span class="t">released their deep research. So there's an experience, actually, I don't like. It's like, you ask a question</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=756" target="_blank">00:12:36.660</a></span> | <span class="t">to deep research, it will return five or six questions for you. You know, I don't think that's a very good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=762" target="_blank">00:12:42.660</a></span> | <span class="t">experience because I want you to solve tasks for me, not asking me more questions. But you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=767" target="_blank">00:12:47.780</a></span> | <span class="t">some of our colleagues, someone in our team, they like this experience. So we have an internal discussion</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=773" target="_blank">00:12:53.860</a></span> | <span class="t">about whether we should do something, maybe like a workflow or maybe like a hard code things to deliver</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=780" target="_blank">00:13:00.500</a></span> | <span class="t">such experience. But instead, we didn't do that. We implemented a personal knowledge system, which is like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=787" target="_blank">00:13:07.140</a></span> | <span class="t">you can just teach Manus. Next time, when you go out to do some research, before you do, before you start,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=793" target="_blank">00:13:13.940</a></span> | <span class="t">just confirm all the details with me and then execute it. Then Manus will, once you accept that knowledge</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=800" target="_blank">00:13:20.580</a></span> | <span class="t">into your personal knowledge system, Manus will remember it. And it will just act like every time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=808" target="_blank">00:13:28.260</a></span> | <span class="t">when you want to do some research, it will confer with you first and then exit. I think all these three</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=814" target="_blank">00:13:34.180</a></span> | <span class="t">things just makes Manus really powerful. But I think the most important part, because if you want to build</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=820" target="_blank">00:13:40.980</a></span> | <span class="t">an agent, all these three things, I think maybe you definitely will give it a try. But we think, why the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=826" target="_blank">00:13:46.980</a></span> | <span class="t">magic happens? Why Manus is such a great experience? The most important part is not about these three</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=834" target="_blank">00:13:54.740</a></span> | <span class="t">components. We think the most important part is that as the fundamental concept of Manus,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=841" target="_blank">00:14:01.700</a></span> | <span class="t">we have this less structure, more intelligence. You can find this sentence at the bottom of our official</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=846" target="_blank">00:14:06.900</a></span> | <span class="t">website. We just, you know, we just believe in this. We took so much faith in it. And how do we define</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=853" target="_blank">00:14:13.460</a></span> | <span class="t">less structure, more intelligence is that when we release Manus, actually, we put 42 use cases on our website.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=860" target="_blank">00:14:20.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And someone said, "Okay, the message is not the same. You just predefined some workflows."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=867" target="_blank">00:14:27.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe you have like 42 predefined workflows. But actually, you know, inside Manus, in the core of Manus,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=873" target="_blank">00:14:33.620</a></span> | <span class="t">we have zero predefined workflows. It's just a very simple but a very robust structure. Very simple structure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=881" target="_blank">00:14:41.700</a></span> | <span class="t">But we just left all the intelligence part to the foundational model. At that time, it is Cloud</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=887" target="_blank">00:14:47.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Solar 3.7. And now we have Cloud 4, right? So what we are doing is like, because we are building the hands,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=895" target="_blank">00:14:55.300</a></span> | <span class="t">right? It's like, we just compose all these contexts to build them into like a more good structure. And then we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=904" target="_blank">00:15:04.020</a></span> | <span class="t">provide more context to the model. And we have less control. When I say less control, I mean multi-role agent system,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=910" target="_blank">00:15:10.660</a></span> | <span class="t">right? You have to specify, this is a coding agent, this is a search agent, this is a ba-ba-ba-ba-ba agent. We think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=917" target="_blank">00:15:17.620</a></span> | <span class="t">all these kinds of forms are a control. It just limits the real potential of LMS. So for us, it's like we just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=925" target="_blank">00:15:25.060</a></span> | <span class="t">provide more context to the model and then let the model to like improvise by itself. And all this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=932" target="_blank">00:15:32.500</a></span> | <span class="t">magic you get from MNAS just come from this very simple but very strong ideology. It's less structure,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=940" target="_blank">00:15:40.340</a></span> | <span class="t">more intelligence. Yeah. So that is the secret behind MNAS. And why we choose Cloud in the first place is for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=950" target="_blank">00:15:50.100</a></span> | <span class="t">three reasons. The first one is about the long-horizon planning. You know, I think before Cloud Solent's models,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=957" target="_blank">00:15:57.860</a></span> | <span class="t">because chatbot is just so successful. So all these models are out there, maybe before this March,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=966" target="_blank">00:16:06.020</a></span> | <span class="t">are post-trained and their alignments is for chatbot scenario. And in chatbot scenario,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=975" target="_blank">00:16:15.220</a></span> | <span class="t">the model intends to answer your question in one term. You ask the question and you get the answer. But,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=981" target="_blank">00:16:21.940</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, in agentic scenarios, like in MNAS, an average task will take maybe 30 or 50 steps and then get the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=990" target="_blank">00:16:30.660</a></span> | <span class="t">final answer. So when we are building MNAS, actually we try every model we can get our hands on. But it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=997" target="_blank">00:16:37.060</a></span> | <span class="t">finds out only Solent can know, okay, I am in a very giant agentic loop. So I should perform the action,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1007" target="_blank">00:16:47.460</a></span> | <span class="t">watch the observation, and decide what's the action, observation, absolute observation. It's just a very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1012" target="_blank">00:16:52.820</a></span> | <span class="t">giant agentic loop. So just Solent know, okay, I am in this loop. So I have to gather more information</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1019" target="_blank">00:16:59.620</a></span> | <span class="t">before I deliver the final result. But, you know, for these five months, we tried all other models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1025" target="_blank">00:17:05.220</a></span> | <span class="t">All of them failed. After maybe only one, two, three iterations, those models will think, okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1031" target="_blank">00:17:11.860</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's enough. I will answer your questions right now. So I think that's a problem. And right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1038" target="_blank">00:17:18.420</a></span> | <span class="t">now what we found the best model to run a very long horizon planning scenes is cloud Solent models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1045" target="_blank">00:17:25.780</a></span> | <span class="t">That is the first thing why we choose cloud. And the first second part is about the tool use. Because,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1051" target="_blank">00:17:31.140</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, agent product just heavily relied on the tool use and the function calling. Yeah, like for us,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1058" target="_blank">00:17:38.740</a></span> | <span class="t">we just abstract all these tools in that virtual machine. We have like 27 tools in that virtual</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1065" target="_blank">00:17:45.140</a></span> | <span class="t">machine. So the agent framework has to decide what the action should be performed into that virtual</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1070" target="_blank">00:17:50.500</a></span> | <span class="t">machine. So it's very important to call the right tool and write the tools parameters right. So at that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1080" target="_blank">00:18:00.020</a></span> | <span class="t">time when we are building managers, we don't have the sync tool in cloud models. So we kind of like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1086" target="_blank">00:18:06.820</a></span> | <span class="t">implemented some mechanism by our own. We call it a COT injection, which is like before every function</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1095" target="_blank">00:18:15.140</a></span> | <span class="t">call. We just will use another specific, we call it a planner agent, to do the reasoning. At that time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1101" target="_blank">00:18:21.380</a></span> | <span class="t">we don't have reasoning too. Yeah, because that's the 3.5. Yeah. So we have to do the reasoning by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1106" target="_blank">00:18:26.820</a></span> | <span class="t">ourselves. And then we inject that reasoning, that COT, into the main agent. And then we perform that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1114" target="_blank">00:18:34.820</a></span> | <span class="t">function call. And what we found out, it just boosts the performance of function calling. And also, in an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1121" target="_blank">00:18:41.380</a></span> | <span class="t">article, a Serapical release at the end of March, with the sync tool, they also found out this. And in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1127" target="_blank">00:18:47.780</a></span> | <span class="t">cloud4, it kind of has some like native support for the thinking in the tool use. I think you guys all say in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1134" target="_blank">00:18:54.820</a></span> | <span class="t">this morning's session. Yeah. So that's the second one. And the first, third one is that we think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1140" target="_blank">00:19:00.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Serapical's model may be the best, they have the best alignment with agentic usage. Because, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1146" target="_blank">00:19:06.500</a></span> | <span class="t">in agentic usage, we have to deal with the browser, the computer. I think Serapical has put so much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1152" target="_blank">00:19:12.740</a></span> | <span class="t">resources on the alignment with the computer use, the browser use thing. So which makes cloud's model maybe the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1160" target="_blank">00:19:20.740</a></span> | <span class="t">best model to build agents. That's why we choose Serapical's models for madness. And also, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1168" target="_blank">00:19:28.100</a></span> | <span class="t">we just spend a lot of tokens on cloud. And also, this is the t-shirt I wear in the GTC event. We just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1176" target="_blank">00:19:36.660</a></span> | <span class="t">wear this shirt in the GTC event. Yeah. We spend like one million dollars on cloud model in the first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1183" target="_blank">00:19:43.620</a></span> | <span class="t">of 14 days. I think maybe that's why they invited us here to get a spin. Yeah. It cost us a lot to be on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1190" target="_blank">00:19:50.180</a></span> | <span class="t">the stage, you know. Yeah. So that's the whole story about the madness so far. Yeah. So if you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1197" target="_blank">00:19:57.380</a></span> | <span class="t">questions, you can just line up at the two mics. We're gonna start from right to left. Yeah, each by each.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1203" target="_blank">00:20:03.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Any questions? Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1207" target="_blank">00:20:07.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Cool. Oh, yeah. There's one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1216" target="_blank">00:20:16.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Hello. Thanks for the presentation. Very interesting. So I don't know how much you can share, but I was just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1227" target="_blank">00:20:27.940</a></span> | <span class="t">curious about in your agentic workflow, especially the browser part, how much is that vision and how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1237" target="_blank">00:20:37.620</a></span> | <span class="t">much is that actually, you know, parsing the code of the web page, right? So how much of it is like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1243" target="_blank">00:20:43.860</a></span> | <span class="t">the model looking at the browser like a person would and how much of that is that is more like a text type</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1251" target="_blank">00:20:51.620</a></span> | <span class="t">of interaction, if that makes sense? Uh, sorry, I may get the question in a second. So when you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1259" target="_blank">00:20:59.460</a></span> | <span class="t">when the minus uses the web browser, right? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. It goes on a website, right? Yeah. And how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1265" target="_blank">00:21:05.620</a></span> | <span class="t">much of the understanding of the web page is based on the vision? Yeah, I got your question. And how much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1270" target="_blank">00:21:10.660</a></span> | <span class="t">is based on that? Yeah, yeah, that's a very good question. Actually, I can share it. It's not a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1274" target="_blank">00:21:14.580</a></span> | <span class="t">secret because, you know, yeah. Uh, um, when we are building master from last October, there is the, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1280" target="_blank">00:21:20.820</a></span> | <span class="t">open, open source project called the browser use. I think most of you guys may know that project.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1285" target="_blank">00:21:25.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So we just take a look at that project. We think their way of how to talk to the browsers is actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1291" target="_blank">00:21:31.540</a></span> | <span class="t">very useful. So we just use that part because, you know, two months later, browser use has its own</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1297" target="_blank">00:21:37.620</a></span> | <span class="t">agent framework. We don't use that part. We don't use that agent framework part. We only use the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1302" target="_blank">00:21:42.660</a></span> | <span class="t">protocol, they talk to the browsers. So the thing we are sending to the, uh, the context we're sending</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1309" target="_blank">00:21:49.460</a></span> | <span class="t">to the foundational model when we are, when medicine is browsing internet are three things. The first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1314" target="_blank">00:21:54.900</a></span> | <span class="t">is the text in this viewport. We will send it to, to, uh, cloud. And the second thing is a screenshot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1323" target="_blank">00:22:03.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. In this viewport. And the third thing is a screenshot, but with bounding boxes. You know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1330" target="_blank">00:22:10.420</a></span> | <span class="t">then the model can decide which area he should click. Yeah. So right now we are just sharing this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1335" target="_blank">00:22:15.780</a></span> | <span class="t">reason to the model. Yeah. I don't know if I answer the question. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1342" target="_blank">00:22:22.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh yeah. Another one. Hi, I have a slightly controversial question, but I want to kind of put,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1348" target="_blank">00:22:28.980</a></span> | <span class="t">put this out to you. Yeah. Uh, with the advancement of a lot of these foundational model and the deep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1354" target="_blank">00:22:34.420</a></span> | <span class="t">research capability, how do you see a wrapper company kind of keeping their edge? Like what,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1362" target="_blank">00:22:42.980</a></span> | <span class="t">how do you see it as sort of, what are the research area? What are the areas that you're concerned about?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1367" target="_blank">00:22:47.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. What are you focused so that you can actually grow in parallel with these foundational model as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1373" target="_blank">00:22:53.140</a></span> | <span class="t">their capability increases? Definitely. I, I kind of get your question because,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1376" target="_blank">00:22:56.580</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, we answer this question for the past two months into a lot of investors, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1381" target="_blank">00:23:01.220</a></span> | <span class="t">they are all asking, okay, what's your motor being as a wrapper, you know, yeah, things like that. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1387" target="_blank">00:23:07.940</a></span> | <span class="t">we think, you know, there will be no mode just for some very specific technology or framework</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1394" target="_blank">00:23:14.500</a></span> | <span class="t">because technology will be out of data very, very, very fast, even for models, right? So we think the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1400" target="_blank">00:23:20.340</a></span> | <span class="t">only thing we can win this competition is about the pace of innovation. Like what you mentioned,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1407" target="_blank">00:23:27.140</a></span> | <span class="t">there's like a use case like deep research. Deep research is one of the main use cases in Manus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1413" target="_blank">00:23:33.220</a></span> | <span class="t">We have like maybe 20% of users are doing deep research every day on Manus. But you know, actually,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1419" target="_blank">00:23:39.300</a></span> | <span class="t">we put zero effort on deep research use cases. Like I just mentioned, we just build a very simple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1427" target="_blank">00:23:47.060</a></span> | <span class="t">structure, a very simple agent framework. The deep research capability is just the emergence from this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1434" target="_blank">00:23:54.420</a></span> | <span class="t">framework, which means, you know, maybe if OpenAI is maybe half a year to do the end-to-end training just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1440" target="_blank">00:24:00.900</a></span> | <span class="t">for these specific use cases. But this capability just, you know, just emerges from the whole structure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1447" target="_blank">00:24:07.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So in six months, maybe we will have like hundreds of use cases like deep research. And also,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1454" target="_blank">00:24:14.580</a></span> | <span class="t">what we can do is like, we can leverage the best model in the world. Yeah, you know, I think these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1461" target="_blank">00:24:21.060</a></span> | <span class="t">are two things. It's about the flexibility of your whole agent framework. And the second thing is like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1467" target="_blank">00:24:27.700</a></span> | <span class="t">we are very flexible of choosing the best model in the world. Yeah. All right. Thank you. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1473" target="_blank">00:24:33.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Hi. Hi. Hi. Hello. Question. So, right now- Oh, maybe the last question. Sorry. Uh, done wrong. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1480" target="_blank">00:24:40.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. Um, so right now you build the, uh, browser in a virtual environment. Yeah. Are you planning to put,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1487" target="_blank">00:24:47.780</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, the browser in a Docker in the local computer and later they can use the local cookie and access all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1494" target="_blank">00:24:54.260</a></span> | <span class="t">account? Yeah. Actually, we, we don't have a plan for local environment because as I just mentioned, we think it's very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1500" target="_blank">00:25:00.180</a></span> | <span class="t">important to like give the users attention back to users. We don't want to like user to pay attention</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1507" target="_blank">00:25:07.380</a></span> | <span class="t">still to his phone or to his computer. We want everything to run in the cloud. And we, we, we don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1512" target="_blank">00:25:12.420</a></span> | <span class="t">just have a, a Linux virtual machine. We still, we, we also have plan to have a virtual Windows, virtual</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1518" target="_blank">00:25:18.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Android for Manus to, to run in the future. So it's all about running in the cloud. Yeah. Okay. I think my time is up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjboGsztHd8&t=1524" target="_blank">00:25:24.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, thanks for guys for today.
