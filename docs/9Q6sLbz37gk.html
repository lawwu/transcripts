target="_blank">00:03:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So I started experimenting with them and I did so in a notebook and as I experimented</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I took down notes to myself and I started to create examples and little tests.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And this now becomes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">part of the documentation and the source code and the tests of the library I ended up building,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">which is called fast webhook.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can see that you can kind of, you can write any kind of code in notebooks and you can end up exporting it</span></div><div

target="_blank">00:04:11.800</a></span> | <span class="t">understand my thinking, understand the APIs I'm using, understanding the parts of the Python standard library I'm using because it's all documented in this process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So a lot of other people are now using nbdev and one of the best comments</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I've seen is from Hamel Hossain from GitHub who said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

when you write with nbdev.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And he says,

the book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=400" target="_blank">00:06:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's another example of something that we created with Jupyter Notebooks,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.280</a></span> | <span class="t">which is a very popular course and of course people really, really like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=411" target="_blank">00:06:51.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Nearly everybody seems to like this course, which we're so proud of because we spend a lot of time trying to get it right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=416" target="_blank">00:06:56.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And the whole thing is actually, or nearly the whole thing, is actually taught in Jupyter Notebooks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And the students then take these notebooks and what we do is we clear out all of the pros and all of the outputs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=431" target="_blank">00:07:11.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and we ask the students to try to go through the notebook and figure out what's going to happen next and why are we doing this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=438" target="_blank">00:07:18.600</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a great way to kind of force people to think about like, "Oh, did I really understand this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=443" target="_blank">00:07:23.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Do I really know what's going to happen?" And then they can run it and check.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=446" target="_blank">00:07:26.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And if the answer is different to what they expected, then they can experiment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=449" target="_blank">00:07:29.720</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a really terrific way to learn and pretty much all of our students have said that once they get into it, they really adore it, they really find it terrific.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=459" target="_blank">00:07:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Overall, the key thing, I guess, that I like about Jupyter Notebooks is that they support literate programming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=467" target="_blank">00:07:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Literate programming is something that I have been fascinated in ever since I read about it in the early 90s,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=472" target="_blank">00:07:52.920</a></span> | <span class="t">developed by Donald Knuth, a famous computer scientist, who describes it as a methodology that combines a programming language with a documentation language,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=483" target="_blank">00:08:03.080</a></span> | <span class="t">thereby making programs more robust, more portable, more easily maintained, and arguably, certainly I find more fun to write.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=491" target="_blank">00:08:11.960</a></span> | <span class="t">The main idea is to treat a program as a piece of literature addressed to human beings rather than to a computer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=498" target="_blank">00:08:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is certainly the way that we now write code with notebooks and NVDev.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=504" target="_blank">00:08:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think we actually go beyond literate programming to what I call exploratory programming,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">where we're using our notebook as a kind of a journal, like a scientist's journal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=515" target="_blank">00:08:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And then when we're done, we'll go back and we'll try to clean it up as best as we can and we'll make that part of what we publish.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=521" target="_blank">00:08:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So, for example, here's the actual source code from NVDev itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=526" target="_blank">00:08:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And at the very start, Sylvain and I didn't know much about what is the Jupyter notebook really behind the scenes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=534" target="_blank">00:08:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And as we started exploring and realizing it's just JSON and printing it out, that became part of our documentation and source code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=544" target="_blank">00:09:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can see we start to create and export functions as we go along, and that becomes part of the library.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=551" target="_blank">00:09:11.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So then when somebody else comes along and wants to contribute to NVDev or to any project written with NVDev,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=559" target="_blank">00:09:19.520</a></span> | <span class="t">they don't really need a huge amount of hand-holding and helping them get involved because they can see not just the final result,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=568" target="_blank">00:09:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">but the process to get there and the thinking and the choices that were made along the way, because they're all part of the notebooks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=574" target="_blank">00:09:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And they can even see the tests and see how the tests are related, and it's all there in one place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=582" target="_blank">00:09:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So overall, notebooks give us a live coding environment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=587" target="_blank">00:09:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">It's live in the sense that you're working directly programming against those live objects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=593" target="_blank">00:09:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">The actual system that you're building them in has the state, has the actual current state of all of the variables and all of the systems in memory,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=605" target="_blank">00:10:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and you can directly interact with it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=608" target="_blank">00:10:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This idea goes back a really long way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=610" target="_blank">00:10:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the most famous examples of a live coding environment is Smalltalk, this one here from Smalltalk80.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=617" target="_blank">00:10:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And as you can see here, as the code is running, things are actually happening on the screen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=622" target="_blank">00:10:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And anybody involved in Smalltalk in those early days will tell you that this was a critical part of why this was such a productive system and why it was such a loved system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=631" target="_blank">00:10:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And a lot of people say there's never really been anything like Smalltalk again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=636" target="_blank">00:10:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">We're kind of almost rediscovering things from decades ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=642" target="_blank">00:10:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There are other interesting examples of live coding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=645" target="_blank">00:10:45.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's a great one from somebody called Sam Aaron, who actually does live coding as performance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=651" target="_blank">00:10:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Here is him writing music with code in real time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=656" target="_blank">00:10:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think that's pretty cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=674" target="_blank">00:11:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's something which is even cooler.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=676" target="_blank">00:11:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">This is Brett Victor, a brilliant designer and a brilliant thinker, showing a real live coding environment he created, which allows him to create games in a whole new way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=690" target="_blank">00:11:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, not just games, you could use this for so many things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=692" target="_blank">00:11:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">But here's an amazing example, using it to build a computer game.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=696" target="_blank">00:11:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So I bounce off my turtle, pause the game, and now hit this button here, which shows my guy's trail.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=704" target="_blank">00:11:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So now I can see where he's been.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=707" target="_blank">00:11:47.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And when I rewind, this trail in front of him is where he's going to be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=713" target="_blank">00:11:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">This is his future.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=715" target="_blank">00:11:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And when I change the code, I change his future.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=721" target="_blank">00:12:01.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So I can find exactly the value I need.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=724" target="_blank">00:12:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So when I hit play, he slips right in there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=731" target="_blank">00:12:11.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So I've got to say I've never managed to build code in a way where the people watching it went whoa and then started clapping.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=738" target="_blank">00:12:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It's certainly something to aspire to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=740" target="_blank">00:12:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can see how much people really love this idea of actually interacting with a live coding environment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=747" target="_blank">00:12:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Brett Victor has been very inspirational.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=749" target="_blank">00:12:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the things he inspired was Chris Latner, who is the guy who created LVM.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=756" target="_blank">00:12:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">He created Swift, and he built the amazing playground system, which as you can see here, as the code is running, you can actually see what it's doing and you can even plot it and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=767" target="_blank">00:12:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Another great example of a popular and important and powerful live coding system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=774" target="_blank">00:12:54.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So I was so proud when actually Chris himself said he thinks that NBDev is a huge step forward for programming environments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=782" target="_blank">00:13:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so for that to come through Chris was a huge validation for us that somebody we really admire thinks that we're absolutely going in the right direction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=794" target="_blank">00:13:14.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Most people, however, are not using this kind of live coding environment despite the decades of work that's kind of gone into these kinds of systems and the productivity that we found comes from it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=808" target="_blank">00:13:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's how a lot of people code, and I'm going to give an example here, you'll see why in a moment, of a very successful coder named Joel Groves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=817" target="_blank">00:13:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">This is Joel here, and he's good enough to actually do coding, which he puts out on the internet for people to watch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=824" target="_blank">00:13:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I watched it to see exactly what this looks like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=826" target="_blank">00:13:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And what he does, like a lot of people do, is he has what's called a line-oriented REPL down here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=831" target="_blank">00:13:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">This is something where you can type in a line and it returns a line.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=834" target="_blank">00:13:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the rest of it is a kind of a standard editor IDE.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=838" target="_blank">00:13:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is VS code, which is one of the best or maybe the best editor around.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=843" target="_blank">00:14:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So watch what happens as he codes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=845" target="_blank">00:14:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">You can see here that he has to kind of go back up to find something he's done before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=851" target="_blank">00:14:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">It's the wrong thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=852" target="_blank">00:14:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then he has to edit it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=853" target="_blank">00:14:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And then he's got an assertion error.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=854" target="_blank">00:14:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Now he has to go somewhere else and then comes down here again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=858" target="_blank">00:14:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Now he's getting this kind of weird situation of some state that's come from the code and some state that's come from the things he's typing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=866"

software engineering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=1741" target="_blank">00:29:01.640</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, it's kind of like this idea that you should copy and paste code and outputs into Slack.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=1748" target="_blank">00:29:08.280</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, that's how people might have done things before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=1752" target="_blank">00:29:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, maybe the rules of software engineering in a dead coding environment or in a line oriented repo or whatever are not the same,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=1763" target="_blank">00:29:23.360</a></span>

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=1770" target="_blank">00:29:30.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And also the rules for a data scientist who's doing research and their focus is on speed of iteration</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=1778" target="_blank">00:29:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and on rapidly

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=1789" target="_blank">00:29:49.360</a></span> | <span class="t">To take an example of a project I've been involved in a lot recently.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=1793" target="_blank">00:29:53.480</a></span> | <span class="t">These are kind of going to

not even notice the tests or they have to kind of flick back and forth between the two.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=1907"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=1914" target="_blank">00:31:54.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Whereas in notebooks and also with NBDev in particular, the tests live right next to the thing they're testing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=1924" target="_blank">00:32:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And they'll

<span class="t">So here we've created a thing called an unbuffered server.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=1934" target="_blank">00:32:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it was in the cell above the one I took a screenshot of here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=1937" target="_blank">00:32:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so here I've created a test handler to test it that sends a response and writes OK.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=1941" target="_blank">00:32:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And here's something that checks whether that starts a server and then checks whether it actually receives that OK or not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=1950" target="_blank">00:32:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's really nice having the test in the notebook and then NBDev provides a way to run all the tests across lots of notebooks and report on the overall result.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=1961" target="_blank">00:32:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And that can be run in continuous integration and NBDev gives you that actually out of the box.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=1967" target="_blank">00:32:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">If you use the NBDev template, you get this kind of continuous integration testing for free.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2479" target="_blank">00:41:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">With notebooks, he said it's hard to do is splitting a class into separate

libraries using NBDev and FAST 4, it's not at all difficult to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2494" target="_blank">00:41:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's a class and I've just got the init in it here and I can create it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2498" target="_blank">00:41:38.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And then later on, I just use this patch decorator to add this method to this class.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2505" target="_blank">00:41:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this is actually going to impact the documentation as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2507" target="_blank">00:41:47.640</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:41:50.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And the documentation of class init, notebook processor init, it's going to end up up here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2515" target="_blank">00:41:55.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it really helps the code reader understand things step by step.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2519" target="_blank">00:41:59.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Each one has test examples kind

through the documentation, you can see each piece one at a time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2529" target="_blank">00:42:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a really nice to me way to build up more complex classes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2535" target="_blank">00:42:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All of the pieces of NBDev all get built out of a single simple little settings file, settings.me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2544" target="_blank">00:42:24.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's really nice because you can provide all of the information just in one place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2548" target="_blank">00:42:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So rather than having a version number over here and init.py and over there and setup.py and over here in your documentation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2555" target="_blank">00:42:35.400</a></span> | <span class="t">you have it once and it's used everywhere.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2557" target="_blank">00:42:37.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Ditto for your description, ditto for your source of your documentation and ditto for your repo information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2564" target="_blank">00:42:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just there in one place and then everything will use that for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2568" target="_blank">00:42:48.440</a></span> | <span class="t">You don't have to put it in multiple places and think about how to maintain it and synchronize it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2573" target="_blank">00:42:53.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Talking of synchronization, not only can you start with a notebook and turn it into this code,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2580" target="_blank">00:43:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">which you can then open in this case, there are human VIM or you can open it in VS code or whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2585" target="_blank">00:43:05.640</a></span> | <span class="t">You can edit it in your editor like VIM or VS code and it will sync it in the opposite direction to and update your notebook.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2593" target="_blank">00:43:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And so some things are easy to do in editors, particularly kind of search and replace across multiple files and stuff like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2602" target="_blank">00:43:22.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Or if it's an unfamiliar code base, it's nice to use the tags to kind of jump across between files.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2608" target="_blank">00:43:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You can edit as you go and then synchronize back to the notebook.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2613" target="_blank">00:43:33.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So then how does the synchronization work?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2616" target="_blank">00:43:36.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, there's two ways you can do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2618" target="_blank">00:43:38.600</a></span> | <span class="t">You can either put this as the last cell in each notebook, notebook to script,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2624" target="_blank">00:43:44.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and that will take the notebook you're working in and all the other notebooks and convert them into modules or at the command line.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2632" target="_blank">00:43:52.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You can run nvdef building.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2635" target="_blank">00:43:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I have this in every notebook that I use because it's kind of nice to stay in the notebook environment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2642" target="_blank">00:44:02.840</a></span> | <span class="t">This is more something I tend to do as part of my release process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2648" target="_blank">00:44:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a lot of little niceties that nvdef tries hard to make nice for you to kind of make your code as correct and as close to best practices as possible,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2661" target="_blank">00:44:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">at least kind of our view of best practices.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2663" target="_blank">00:44:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the best practices that we think are important is dunderall.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2667" target="_blank">00:44:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Dunderall is the thing that Python provides for you where you get to list what are the exported symbols in your module.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2676" target="_blank">00:44:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">If you don't provide dunderall and nearly nobody that's not an nvdef user provides it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2682" target="_blank">00:44:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">then it exports all the symbols, not just the symbols which or anything without a leading underscore,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2687" target="_blank">00:44:47.640</a></span> | <span class="t">not just the ones that you've actually directly typed in as your code,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2692" target="_blank">00:44:52.280</a></span> | <span class="t">but everything you import also gets exported and that very quickly can lead to namespace pollution.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2700" target="_blank">00:45:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But with an nvdef module, because we automatically create a dunderall for you, which includes only the things that you requested be exported,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2709" target="_blank">00:45:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that means that you can see the imports, for example, from fastcore.transform, which is part of an nvdef library.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2715" target="_blank">00:45:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's just stuff from fastcore.transform.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2718" target="_blank">00:45:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Or else if you look at something from alannlp.nn.util, you get copy, JSON, logging, default, etc. This is not stuff created by alannlp.nn.util.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2733" target="_blank">00:45:33.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And so because this is built using the traditional VS code approach, it really is too much work to manually create dunderall.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2745" target="_blank">00:45:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the alannlp folks don't do it, just like pretty much every other Python library, not all of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2752" target="_blank">00:45:52.040</a></span> | <span class="t">TK, for example, which comes with Python, does define dunderall, which is nice, but I don't know very many non-nvdev projects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2764" target="_blank">00:46:04.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So here's another nice thing with a documentation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2766" target="_blank">00:46:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">In the docs, you can just put your symbols in bactics, and then when you create the docs, which again, it's automatic, and it can be part of your CI system, in fact, that is by default, you can see it actually creates hyperlinks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2780" target="_blank">00:46:20.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So nvdev knows how to actually look up each of these symbols and hyperlink to them, even things like this, which are part of different libraries.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2792" target="_blank">00:46:32.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is a really nice feature which allows you to help out your users so that they can see exactly what you're talking about by jumping to other parts of the docs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2803" target="_blank">00:46:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And of course, some things shouldn't be hyperlinked, like these, this is a parameter name, and so those will not end up hyperlinked.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2812" target="_blank">00:46:52.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So the documentation which gets built for you supports all the kinds of features you might imagine, a hierarchical menu to take you to any part of the documentation pages, a table of contents for each page, you can have badges, opening collab, headings, links, all that kind of stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2829" target="_blank">00:47:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So the documentation comes out pretty nice, I think.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2834" target="_blank">00:47:14.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So here's what happens, you just run nvdev build docs, and it takes a second or so, it's all done in parallel, or you can have something like a GitHub action or whatever continuous integration system you use and call the fast AI workflows build docs GitHub action.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2853" target="_blank">00:47:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So then, you can open those docs directly as a notebook. And one of them is special, which is the one called index.ipynb, index.ipynb will automatically be turned into a readme.md for you as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2871" target="_blank">00:47:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So no more worrying about trying to keep your files synchronized to make sure that your homepage and your readme is saying the same thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2880" target="_blank">00:48:00.040</a></span> | <span class="t">We actually do that for you automatically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2883" target="_blank">00:48:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">We also, of course, make sure that it's not only the notebook, but the homepage on your documentation website, and even your PyPy and Conda descriptions will all end up showing you the same information from your index notebook.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2897" target="_blank">00:48:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So in this way, because we're just saying build stuff in one place, do it once, and then we'll make sure that everything syncs up for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2904" target="_blank">00:48:24.040</a></span> | <span class="t">That makes it trivially easy to create really nice user experiences for your users.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2912" target="_blank">00:48:32.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So for me, even when I create tiny, simple little projects, I always do them in nbdev, because that way I know that I can, you know, in a minute or two, provide installable libraries and documentation just in case anybody else is interested in using my work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2929" target="_blank">00:48:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And often I find, you know, even for stuff that I think is pretty niche, there's always a few people who are interested in using it too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2936" target="_blank">00:48:56.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's an example, actually.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2938" target="_blank">00:48:58.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Fast Webhook, which I mentioned before, it's really just written for myself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2942" target="_blank">00:49:02.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Fast AI, I wanted a webhook that would send out a tweet any time there was a release, but I did it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2950" target="_blank">00:49:10.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I wrote it in like two hours, I guess, and then I just hit make release. And because I made it from nbdev template, it automatically created the Conda package and the PyPy package for me and everything was all set up, which is really nice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2968" target="_blank">00:49:28.040</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the challenges with working with notebooks on version control is you can get some really ugly diffs that won't even load in notebooks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2977" target="_blank">00:49:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">nbdev will actually ensure that those diffs are turned into what I would call a notebook level diff, which is to say it always ensures that your notebooks can be opened.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2987" target="_blank">00:49:47.040</a></span> | <span class="t">If there's a difference only in cell outputs, it just ignores them and just picks one because, you know, you can just rerun it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=2994" target="_blank">00:49:54.040</a></span> | <span class="t">If there's actually a difference between, you know, in a cell, two people have changed the same cell, then it will actually show you the diff tags in a notebook, you can open it up in Jupyter and fix it up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=3007" target="_blank">00:50:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">All of your tests run in parallel with nbdev test nb's using as many cores as you have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=3017" target="_blank">00:50:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is a great way to ensure that every notebook runs from the top to the bottom and has the actual outputs that you're expecting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=3027" target="_blank">00:50:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Lots of nice little pieces like math equation support, all the low tech equations work nicely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=3034" target="_blank">00:50:34.040</a></span> | <span class="t">You use it in your markdown and it pops up in your both in your notebooks and in your documentation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=3041" target="_blank">00:50:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">You're using KATEC, which is a really nice fast library for that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=3047" target="_blank">00:50:47.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And there are other things that we power as well, not just publishing libraries, but nbdev also powers fast pages, which is a increasingly popular blogging system where you can write Jupyter notebooks and it turns it into a blog.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=3063" target="_blank">00:51:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is really nice for anybody who is often trying to communicate technical content involving equations and/or code, visualizations, no more copying and pasting, just sent to medium or copying and pasting, you know, outputs, you know, plot outputs into files.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=3084" target="_blank">00:51:24.040</a></span> | <span class="t">When you can do the whole thing in a notebook, there's nothing to think about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=3088" target="_blank">00:51:28.040</a></span> | <span class="t">It just works, which makes life very easy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=3091" target="_blank">00:51:31.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And as we discussed earlier, fast doc takes notebooks and turns them into publication quality books.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=3099" target="_blank">00:51:39.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So I hope that you might give it a go and see why I like Jupyter notebooks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=3106" target="_blank">00:51:46.040</a></span> | <span class="t">You can just go to nbdev.fast.ai, which is, of course, a nbdev-powered documentation site, and you can just click a button and it will create your nbdev repo for you and you can get started.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk&t=3120" target="_blank">00:52:00.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Thanks so much for watching, and I hope that you try this out and find that you like Jupyter notebooks too. Thanks.</span></div></div></body></html>
