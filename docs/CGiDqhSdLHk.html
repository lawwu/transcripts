So maybe I can try to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGiDqhSdLHk&t=89" target="_blank">00:01:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">summarize assembly theory, and you tell me if I'm wrong. - Go for it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGiDqhSdLHk&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">- So assembly theory says that if we look at any object in the universe, any object,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGiDqhSdLHk&t=99" target="_blank">00:01:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that we can quantify how complex it is by trying to find the number of steps it took to create it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGiDqhSdLHk&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and also we can determine if it was built by a process akin to evolution by looking at how many</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGiDqhSdLHk&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">copies of the object there are. - Yeah, that's spot on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGiDqhSdLHk&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">- Spot on. I was not expecting that. Okay, so let's go through definitions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGiDqhSdLHk&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's a central equation I'd love to talk about, but definition-wise, what is an object?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGiDqhSdLHk&t=129" target="_blank">00:02:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">- Yeah, an object, so if I'm going to try to be as meticulous as possible,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGiDqhSdLHk&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.640</a></span> | <span class="t">objects need to be finite and they need to be decomposable into subunits. All human-made</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGiDqhSdLHk&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">artifacts are objects. Is a planet an object? Probably yes, if you scale out. So an object is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGiDqhSdLHk&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">finite and countable and decomposable, I suppose mathematically. But yeah, I still wake up some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGiDqhSdLHk&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">days and go, think to myself, what is an object? Because it's a non-trivial question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGiDqhSdLHk&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">- Persists over time. I'm quoting from the paper here. An object that's finite is distinguishable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGiDqhSdLHk&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's a weird adjective, distinguishable. - We've had so many people help offering to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGiDqhSdLHk&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">rewrite the paper after it came out, you wouldn't believe it's so funny.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGiDqhSdLHk&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">- Persists over time and is breakable such that the set of constraints to construct it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGiDqhSdLHk&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">from elementary building blocks is quantifiable. Such that the set of constraints to construct it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGiDqhSdLHk&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.280</a></span> | <span class="t">from elementary building blocks is quantifiable. - The history is in the objects. It's kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGiDqhSdLHk&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">cool, right? - So what defines the object is its history</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGiDqhSdLHk&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">or memory, whichever is the sexier word. - I'm happy with both depending on the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGiDqhSdLHk&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">- Okay. So the set of steps it took to create the object. So there's a sense</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGiDqhSdLHk&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">in which every object in the universe has a history. And that is part of the thing that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGiDqhSdLHk&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">is used to describe its complexity. How complicated it is. Okay. What is an assembly index?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGiDqhSdLHk&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">- So the assembly index, if you're to take the object apart and be super lazy about it or minimal,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGiDqhSdLHk&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">it's like you've got a really short term memory. So what you do is you lay all the parts on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGiDqhSdLHk&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">path and you find the minimum number of steps you take on the path to add the parts together</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGiDqhSdLHk&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">to reproduce the object. And that minimum number is the assembly index. It's a minimum bound.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGiDqhSdLHk&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was always my intuition the minimum bound in assembly theory was really important. I only</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGiDqhSdLHk&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.520</a></span> | <span class="t">worked out why a few weeks ago, which was kind of funny because I was just like, no, this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGiDqhSdLHk&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">sacrosanct. I don't know why. It will come to me one day. And then when I was pushed by a bunch of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGiDqhSdLHk&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">mathematicians, we came up with the correct physical explanation, which I can get to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGiDqhSdLHk&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">but it's the minimum and it's really important. It's the minimum. And the reason I knew the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGiDqhSdLHk&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">minimum was right is because we could measure it. So almost before this paper came out,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGiDqhSdLHk&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">we've published papers, explain how you can measure the assembly index of molecules.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGiDqhSdLHk&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">- Okay. So that's not so trivial to figure out. So when you look at an object, we can say a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGiDqhSdLHk&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">molecule, we can say object more generally to figure out the minimum number of steps it takes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGiDqhSdLHk&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">to create that object. That doesn't seem like a trivial thing to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGiDqhSdLHk&t=316" target="_blank">00:05:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">- So with molecules, it's not trivial, but it is possible because what you can do,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGiDqhSdLHk&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and because I'm a chemist, so I'm kind of like, I see the lens of the world through just chemistry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGiDqhSdLHk&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I break the molecule apart and break bonds. And if you break up, if you take a molecule and you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGiDqhSdLHk&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">break it all apart, you have a bunch of atoms. And then you can say, okay, I'm going to then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGiDqhSdLHk&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">form bond, take the atoms and form bonds and go up the chain of events to make the molecule.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGiDqhSdLHk&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's what made me realize, take a toy example, literally toy example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGiDqhSdLHk&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.840</a></span> | <span class="t">take a Lego object, which is broken up of Lego blocks. So you could do exactly the same thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGiDqhSdLHk&t=355" target="_blank">00:05:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">In this case, the Lego blocks are naturally the smallest. They're the atoms in the actual composite</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGiDqhSdLHk&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Lego architecture. But then if you maybe take a couple of blocks and put them together in a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGiDqhSdLHk&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">certain way, maybe they're offset in some way, that offset is on the memory. You can use that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGiDqhSdLHk&t=374" target="_blank">00:06:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">offset again with only a penalty of one, and you can then make a square triangle and keep going.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGiDqhSdLHk&t=379" target="_blank">00:06:19.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And you remember those motifs on the chain. So you can then leap from the start with all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGiDqhSdLHk&t=386" target="_blank">00:06:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Lego blocks or atoms just laid out in front of you and say, right, I'll take you, you, you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGiDqhSdLHk&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">connect and do the least amount of work.

What does that mean? That means that the molecular composition,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGiDqhSdLHk&t=2316" target="_blank">00:38:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the bonding and so on, the configuration is indistinguishable.

I like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGiDqhSdLHk&t=6250" target="_blank">01:44:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">reading. I read a lot.

So you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGiDqhSdLHk&t=6320" target="_blank">01:45:20.560</a></span> | <span class="t">didn't actually have to pay. You didn't have to pay if I failed. So I took the exams and passed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGiDqhSdLHk&t=6324" target="_blank">01:45:24.720</a></span> | <span class="t">them, fortunately. I didn't get the top grades, but I, you know, I got into A-levels. But then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGiDqhSdLHk&t=6330" target="_blank">01:45:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that also kind of limited what I could do at A-levels.
