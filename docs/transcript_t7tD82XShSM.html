Do you still recommend people go do them themselves also? - Usually not. The fear is, well, that's the seller's inspector. But the inspectors themselves are licensed professionals that don't really care who the seller is, who the buyer is.</p><p>They just wanna make sure they don't miss anything so they don't get sued. So what I tell my clients when you're getting inspections someone else has done, is call the home inspector and ask them, like, you can actually do that, especially if you're the one who pays for the inspection.</p><p>But even if you're not, hey, I see in your inspection line 9C2 shows this. Is that something I should be worried about? You get great information from home inspectors. They give you the context that's often missing, especially 'cause when you're first buying a house, or even if you've owned a lot of houses, we don't know what a lot of that stuff means.</p><p>You see a report and it lists something, you're like, well, is that a bad thing or not a bad thing?</p></div></div></body></html>
