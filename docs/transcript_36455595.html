Welcome back to the Everyday Educator podcast. Today, I have Kevin with me. He is the founder of Biblingo, and I cannot wait for you guys to learn more about this resource and to dive deeper into the Word of God. So without any further ado, Kevin, welcome to the show.</p><p>Thank you very much. Happy to be here, Jaleese. Well, I'm happy to have you. And I know I just asked you this question off air, but no one heard it but me. So will you briefly just introduce yourself to our listeners for people who maybe aren't familiar with you and your work, and especially for people who don't know anything about Biblingo?</p><p>Yeah. So depending on what kind of answer you want, I'm several different things. I'm a dad of four with one on the way. And so I have Rhoda, who's the oldest, Olivia, six, Emmett is four, and then Amos is two. So I am an active homeschool parent. I do part of their homeschooling every morning for about an hour.</p><p>So that's my, you know, family life, which takes up basically all of my life besides my Biblingo life. So Biblingo is a Greek and Hebrew, or it's a language learning software for biblical Greek and Hebrew. So I did my PhD in Israel at Hebrew University in Hebrew, and wanted to help at the time, especially Bible translators who are translating into another language, learn Greek and Hebrew, so they can better translate, but basically have found that it's applicable for anyone and everyone who wants you to learn these languages.</p><p>So we're in about 70 countries or so around the world, have lots of different people learning the languages through Biblingo. That is amazing. And as you know, most of our audience are homeschooling parents. It's so cool to hear that you're able to be involved in your kids' homeschooling journey every day.</p><p>I know that your wife probably appreciates that, but also it probably makes a really big difference in how your children are learning. And so from that perspective, someone listening might be thinking, okay, I love Jesus. I love the Word of God. Help me understand why I need to learn to read Greek and Hebrew.</p><p>Yeah, yeah. So I would say, first of all, we have very good translations, and we have, you know, we are really in a very privileged position as speakers of English. We have many, many, many different translations. But still, the reality is that if you're reading in English, you're reading a translation.</p><p>And by virtue of being a translation, it is necessarily an interpretation. And whatever, you know, you might read on the front cover of your Bible to say that it's not an interpretation. It's, you know, the most accurate translation there is, like, there is no such thing as a translation that is not an interpretation.</p><p>And that's okay. That's just the nature of it. And, and so the reality is, is that God spoke to us in a particular culture, a particular language. And if you want to know the text, the best you can, you have to know that culture and that language. So really, for me, I mean, the reason why I wanted to learn, learn these languages to begin with is for that very reason, I want to know exactly what God said, and to interpret it as faithfully as I can, so that I can live it out as best I can.</p><p>So really, it is a matter of, you know, you can only go so far if you don't know the original languages and culture of the Bible. Yeah, I am not going to even pretend to be fluent in Greek, Hebrew, or Aramaic. But I will say that somewhere around high school, I got saved in early middle school, somewhere around high school, I hit that wall where I learned that I wanted to understand more than English could give me of my Bible.</p><p>And so I started digging into things, into different websites and resources. And, you know, there are a million out there, so I don't need to name which ones I like best. But so that I could see the original language so that I could study to figure out what each individual word meant, because there was confusion from either well-meaning people who were teaching me or just myself seeing the same word used in eight different passages and wondering to myself, how can this one word actually mean what I know it to mean in English in all of these different passages?</p><p>And so even if you don't consider yourself to be a scholar, if you want to hear from the Lord and have at least some sense of clarity about what you're reading, those skills are useful. And so when I heard about this, I said, give me that interview. I want to talk about this because I know just a little bit that I've learned has changed my life.</p><p>And so I'm really curious to hear, you know, you said that you went to Israel to study. What did studying in Israel do for your faith and your understanding of the word of God? Yeah, I mean, I could, you know, talk all day about what it changed in my, you know, understanding.</p><p>I mean, it's just completely different. I mean, honestly, though, I would say my just perspective and approach is different. Just having been there, having seen, you know, the places where Jesus walked, and the just being in, like, living in that culture for for so long, I was there for five years, just shaped the way I approached the text.</p><p>And so it's not even like, you know, I mean, I could point to specific examples and specific passages. But I just approach everything completely differently now. And, and to me, you know, and this is what I kind of what I tell people about reading the Bible in the original languages versus reading it in a translation.</p><p>You know, it's kind of like watching a movie in black and white versus color. It's, it's, it's not as if like, um, the story changes, but your entire experience of, um, the, the film changes. Um, and so that, that's kind of what I would say is, um, you get such a richer understanding, um, and experience of God's word by reading it in the originals.</p><p>Um, and, and by exploring the culture as well, um, which is, you know, what you get to do in, in Israel itself. Can you give us a specific example of a passage that might seem to read one way, but then if you know what the language means, and then if you know the cultural context, there's a much deeper interpretation or connotation for that, for that passage?</p><p>Yeah. Oh, I mean, I, I could go many different passages. I mean, one, um, you know, kind of well-known known one is, um, Deuteronomy 6, 4, which is called the Shema in, in Israel. Um, it's probably the most famous verse in, uh, the old Testament here, Israel, the Lord, our God, the Lord is one is, um, how it's translated most of the time.</p><p>But if you look at some translations, um, there is some debate about the last word. Sometimes you'll see like, um, here, here, Oh, Israel, the Lord, our God. Um, the Lord is our God, the Lord alone. And, and this is where, um, you know, if you don't know Hebrew, it's hard to know like which one's right.</p><p>Right. Um, what, what's really being said here? Um, if you look at, so, so my world also, I mean, I, you know, I present at like scholarly conferences and I'm, I'm very much a like Bible scholar and in, in, in, in that world. Um, so this is something that, you know, I've done work on and, and scholars debate because they debate everything.</p><p>Um, but what I would say is that, um, I think the best reading of this text is, um, you know, here, Israel, the Lord is our God. The Lord is the only one. And so it's not a statement about, you know, monotheism or God's oneness, um, as you might think of it.</p><p>Um, but it's a statement of Israel, um, Israel's allegiance to Yahweh as their God to the exclusion of any other God. And that makes far more sense in, um, the context of Deuteronomy where they're about to enter into the promised land. Um, and they need to hold to Yahweh as their one and only God.</p><p>Um, so you kind of get that in, in the, um, you know, Yahweh is our God, Yahweh alone translations. Um, again, me as a scholar, I've kind of argued for, um, Yahweh is the only one as a better reading of, of the Hebrew. Um, and, and so that's, that's the kind of thing though, you know, what the way you translate that passage affects how you understand it.</p><p>Um, and if you, as an English reader, um, see Yahweh is one, you're going to, you're going to understand it differently than I would, if I were to, if you were to read it as Yahweh is the only one or Yahweh alone. Um, and so you, you really are in some ways at the mercy of the translators, um, and their translation philosophy and their theology and all that stuff, which is fine.</p><p>I mean, again, I think we need translations. Um, but you don't get to participate in that conversation of like, which one is the better reading? Um, unless you know something about the Hebrew that underlies it. I love that word that you just used participating in the conversation, you know, here at classical conversations, we believe that the parents are the lead learners, but that just means that we're participating in the conversation of learning that we're continuing to uncover different layers, whether we're talking about one plus one is two, you know, and the other day, my, my son, he's three years old and I'm pregnant with the next one, but he came up to me and he said, one and one is two.</p><p>And I thought that was so interesting. Cause I always, when I was a kid, did it this way. Right. But he, he was showing me a different way to think about it because that's the way that was illustrated in his mind. I know about that simple addition, but participating in the conversation with him that way, it caused me to see it a slightly different way and want to ask more questions.</p><p>Um, and so of course the same would be true of the word of God. And I'm, I'm wondering if you can help us understand how we could take something like Biblingo and start to use it with maybe a younger child, an earlier elementary child, you know, is this something that we need to wait until they're cognitively ready to absorb?</p><p>Or is this something that we could use at an earlier age and give them bite-sized pieces? And if so, how could we do that? Yeah. Yeah. That's great. Um, yeah. So my, I mean, I tell you from my own experience, my, my four, six and 11 year old, um, all do Biblingo.</p><p>Um, my four year old, you can see a video of him on YouTube reading Hebrew. Um, so he, and honestly, I, I chose to teach them Hebrew first. Um, I mean, because it's harder than Greek, so I'm, I can do both. Um, but, but I wanted to see like, can, can the four year old learn Hebrew and learn to read it?</p><p>Um, and he can, and, and, you know, he was this morning reading a story on his own in Hebrew. Um, and so what, what I would say is, um, we have to get out of this mindset that these languages are for scholars. Um, these languages can be learned by anyone.</p><p>Um, and, and really, you know, it's interesting because in the other Abrahamic faiths, they, they care deeply about not only their texts, but the language that their text is in. So, you know, for, uh, Muslims, they will, they will read the Bible in Arabic and it really doesn't count if you're reading it in a translation, um, for them.</p><p>I mean, it, part of, part of learning the Quran is to learn Arabic. Um, the same thing for Jews that they, they are, they're going to learn Hebrew to read their text. Um, and, and so for us, you know, who have what we believe to be the right text, right.</p><p>Um, how much more should we be learning these languages, um, to get at the heart of, of what these words mean. And, and, and so this is a big part of our mission is to make the biblical languages easier to learn and more accessible. Um, and so, you know, my four-year-old can do it.</p><p>I would say anyone can do it, right. Um, you have to, you have to put in the time, like it's going to take some time. Um, but absolutely it's accessible, um, for, for people of all ages and, and just like any other language, right? Like it, it takes, um, you do, you have to, uh, what I tell people basically is that humans are built to learn languages.</p><p>They're very, very good at it. Everyone knows a language. Even if you can't speak, you, you will learn a language. Um, but, but the way we acquire languages, um, can be difficult, especially if you do it in the wrong way. So if, if you, um, are just trying to figure out like, you know, if this word is a noun or a verb or an adjective or whatever, um, that's not the same as using the language.</p><p>So my son doesn't know, um, what a noun or a verb are, right. Um, but he can read Hebrew. Um, and so if we get back to, um, sort of the, the way humans are naturally good at learning languages, um, yeah, absolutely. This, this is applicable for, for anyone of all ages.</p><p>That's so great. So when I'm hearing you say the way that humans naturally learn languages, I hear two things. One, I hear immersion because that's what I've experienced. Um, my mother is bilingual. And so I was telling my husband the other day, there are still words that come to my mind first in French and I don't speak French often, but my mind thinks these words first, because when I was a little child, she would just walk around talking to us in French and she would speak English too, but that's just, I learned it through immersion.</p><p>And so you're absolutely right that these languages are accessible because there are languages. So everyone is, is programmed to communicate and in the countries where they're still spoken, that's their first language, you know, it wasn't a huge hurdle for them. So the fact that we sort of put, um, Greek and Hebrew in a specific box and say, it's only for scholars isn't even quite logical if we think about what we know of the world.</p><p>Um, but I would love to know how you've made it easier, as you said, or more accessible. What exactly is that approach that you're using? Yeah. Yeah. So that's, that's a great question. Basically, um, you know, the reason why immersion works is because what you're doing is you are connecting, um, words to the world, right?</p><p>And you're doing it enough times to where it just enter basically enters into long-term memory. Um, so that's, that's fundamentally what we have to do is we have to connect the words to the world. The problem is we don't have that world anymore. Right. Um, and because people don't, um, speak these languages specifically biblical Greek and Hebrew, which are not the same as modern Greek and Hebrew, um, we don't have access to connecting that same, you know, thing words to world.</p><p>Um, and we can't do it repetitively enough to, to put it into long-term memory. Um, basically we solve those problems by, um, recreating the world and connecting it to the world. So we have, um, you know, in our app, we have thousands of, um, images and videos shot in Israel with recreated, um, you know, first century or 10th century BC, uh, scenes that basically we've described in biblical Hebrew and Greek.</p><p>So we are basically teaching you how, um, to learn Hebrew and Greek as close as possible to how, you know, children would have learned those languages back in the day. Right. They would have heard their mother say, um, you know, tuto estin poterion. This is a cup. Right. Um, and they would have seen her hold up a cup and, and we have basically recreated that scene, put the Greek in, put audio in, put the text in.</p><p>Um, and so that you basically have that same sort of experience as a, you know, like I said, first century, um, or 10th century BC, uh, child would have. That is so cool. So how did you create that? If you don't mind me asking, because it sounds extremely complicated.</p><p>It was a lot of work. So, so I'll say, so I was in Israel, right. Um, and you know, do my PhD and, um, basically I, I took classes there that were immersion Greek and Hebrew, ancient Greek and Hebrew classes. So, um, you know, you'd walk into class and you could only speak in ancient Hebrew and Greek.</p><p>That was, those were the rules. Um, and so there's this, you know, weird group of people over there that that's, that's what they do. Um, you know, it, it would, it would be kind of like, you know, walking into a setting here where, um, you're only allowed to speak Shakespeare English.</p><p>Right. Um, so we would think that was very, very weird, but what it does is it forces you to learn the language for the exact reasons that we've already said. Right. Um, and so I got to thinking like, okay, um, can we just bring this experience, um, that I'm having in Israel to everyone, right.</p><p>Through the technology that we have today. Right. Um, we can take a, I mean, I, I had the privilege of being in the land. Right. Um, and there's all these reconstructions, um, of the biblical world in Israel. Um, so I said, yeah, we can just reconstruct, you know, what, what this scene would have looked like, um, film it and then put the Greek and Hebrew were on top of it.</p><p>Um, so that, that was basically the, the idea, um, was just to bring in many ways, the experience that I had, right. Um, to everyone through, through the use of software. That is so cool. And I feel like such a great illustration of how we can use technology to build our faith.</p><p>You know, the technology is helping you bolstering you, pushing you along, not keeping you back. Um, and so I love that you've done that and that you've made it accessible in such a way that a child can use it or an adult can use it. Can you tell me some stories and it could be stories from your own life with your kids, but of how families are utilizing this on a regular basis, like what would a routine look like if you wanted to integrate Biblingo into your life?</p><p>Yeah. I mean, I can tell you, obviously I know my own routine best, but, but, um, we just do it for, for 30 minutes a day. So I will, um, you know, it's just, we have a set number of hours that we have to fill. Um, and you know, the kids will basically, um, do 30 minutes.</p><p>I have them do, uh, a new lesson, um, three days of the week and review two days of the week. Um, and they are basically, you know, can do it on their own. I mean, obviously I can help them if I need to. Um, and I do sometimes, but, um, you know, it, it is the, I mean, I've kind of tried to build it to where you don't need help, right?</p><p>I mean, it's, it's all there. Um, I will help them read stories. So, uh, you know, I, like I said, my, my four year old can read Hebrew stories. Um, I will often, you know, sit with them and read through the story with them, make sure they understand it, um, help them wherever they need it and then have them go back and do it on their own.</p><p>But honestly, it is really as simple as, um, going through the program, um, consistently and, um, you know, really just letting, letting the, you know, the kind of the software do the work, right? I mean, we've laid out what you need to do. You just do the next thing we tell you to do, and you should learn the language.</p><p>Um, the only thing I would say, you know, sort of my advice, if someone were to say, Hey, I want to adopt this. Um, I would say you can't go to slow. Um, so especially for kids, right. Um, go over it again and, and it's totally okay. Um, to just go slowly.</p><p>Um, it's, it's a long game, especially, you know, for kids, like I wish my parents, you know, would have taught me Greek and Hebrew growing up. Um, but you've got time, you know? Um, and, and so I would say, you know, give them confidence that, that they can do it.</p><p>Um, put them at a level where they can succeed and, um, and just keep at it. And then you know, before you know it, your kids really will be reading in these languages. Yeah. You're reminding me a lot about what our founder Lee Bortons has written regarding literacy. She says, you know, in order to build your literacy, you need to read above your reading level.</p><p>You need to read on your reading level and you need to read below it actually on a regular basis. And I think sometimes when we consider ourselves to be literate or we think that we've arrived because we're a certain age, we forget what you just said, that you really can't go too slow and you don't need to leave behind the basics just to grow.</p><p>Sometimes you need to, to slow it down a lot and, and really focus on things that, you know, just so you can increase your speed and that will help you to gain traction, um, in a new language. And so I love that you added that and have you seen a connection in your children between learning Hebrew and their other academics?</p><p>That's interesting. Um, I, I was thinking this morning, you know, like Hebrew is probably the, the hardest thing. Well, honestly, for my four, six and 11 year old, um, who are all doing it, uh, it, it is, it's, it's, it's the hardest in the sense that none of them have any sort of advantage over the other.</p><p>Right. And they're all just like totally new to it. Um, and, and so what I've seen, um, you know, is like, it forces you, it forces them to think differently, even about like the world, because they're thinking, I mean, to think in two different languages, um, is to think about the world differently.</p><p>It just is like, there's just, um, some ways in which like your description of the world in another language is not the same. Um, and so honestly, I, I, um, I'm very curious myself to see what kind of fruit that bears in the future of like their worldview. Um, we're already sort of eclectic in terms of, um, you know, our, our worldviews in our house, my, my two older daughters are adopted.</p><p>Um, and so they, we adopted them three years ago from Liberia. Um, and, uh, and my son, Emmett, who's four, um, was born in Israel. Um, so we have, you know, a lot of different influences, but, um, but yeah, I, I, I think absolutely, I can already see, you know, um, their ability to describe the world differently in Hebrew, um, affects, you know, their, their perspective on, on how the world, uh, is viewed.</p><p>That is fascinating. I would love for you to report back on that. Yeah. Especially as your older ones make it into their teen years, you know, and they start just crossing some of those different cognitive hurdles. I'd be, I'd be really interested to hear that. A common objection that I've heard to teaching young children different languages is that they think if I teach, you know, my three-year-old, my four-year-old to speak Spanish, for example, isn't that going to mess up their ability to articulate English and to process English?</p><p>Am I going to slow them down? What would you say to someone who's concerned that they're going to confuse their child by introducing a language that they maybe aren't hearing on a regular basis too early? Yeah. So I, I think, well, first of all, my background is in, is in linguistics.</p><p>So there's, this is just an empirical question, right? Like there's, there's been studies on it. Um, and, and if I'm remembering the studies correctly, um, there, there is a sort of lag. So like if you, um, if you are teaching two different languages at the same time, um, you know, there is a period in which your, uh, student will be a little bit behind others who are only learning one language.</p><p>Um, but by the time you get to high school, it's, it has reversed where the student who has, um, learned two languages is ahead on both. Um, and so, I mean, honestly, there's, you know, it's well, well known that there are a lot of cognitive benefits, um, to learning a second language.</p><p>So what I would say is, you know, even if it's Spanish, right, whatever, whatever language it is, um, you know, you, you are absolutely going to be doing your kids a, you know, favor, um, by forcing them to learn a new language, um, in terms of their, you know, uh, I don't know, academic prowess, right?</p><p>Or, or, or how well they're going to, how well they're going to, you know, do academically. Um, absolutely. There's, I, I think, I think, you know, that's not an argument, um, rooted in data, right? Um, I think the data would suggest the opposite, but there is that lag. I mean, there, I mean, I, that, that, I think that's real.</p><p>Um, I can say again for my, honestly, I, I wasn't planning on having my, um, four-year-old Emmett learn to read Hebrew. I was going to have him just like learn to speak it first because that's how we normally do it in our, um, in our first language. Um, but he, he learned to, to read English and I said, oh, okay, well, Hebrew is easier to read than English.</p><p>So you can do this just fine. Um, and he did. So I, I, I, I do think that if you just, you know, stick with it, um, you're probably going to be fine in, in both categories anyway. Yeah, that's great. When I'm hearing you say that it makes me wish that I could have studied my young brain and then maybe my teen brain, because I, I remember thinking I have a lot of very early memories down to like maybe one and a half, but I didn't speak for a while.</p><p>And when I started speaking, I remember the day because my mom cried, she was standing in the kitchen. She said, oh my goodness. And I was speaking in full sentences. And I wonder as the third child, if part of it was because our house was kind of bilingual and there were just so many different things going on in my mind that I didn't really need to speak.</p><p>I was again, the third child, the first girl, my brothers were saying everything I needed said. And so I just kind of listened, but I know that also what you just said was true for me in high school that I had an easy time picking up different languages. And it just wasn't, it wasn't as challenging as it was for my peers.</p><p>And I wonder if it's that the data that you just described, but something that you've said at least twice in this conversation so far is that Hebrew is easier to learn than blank. And I think people would be very surprised to hear that. For example, you just said Hebrew is easier to read than English.</p><p>that she said it's easier to learn than Greek. Why are you saying that? What makes that true? Yeah. So just to clarify, I don't know if I said that Hebrew is easier than Greek. I would say that Greek is easier than Hebrew, at least when children started. But I would say that both are way easier than English in terms of reading.</p><p>So there's like a, you know, fundamental problem with the English spelling system. Basically we, the technical term is we have a lot of graphemes per morphemes, which basically means that, or sorry, per phonemes, which basically means that the symbols we see on the page. Um, there's a many to many correspondence, um, between, you know, an A for example, and the sound that it might make.</p><p>Um, and so that, that makes it very, very hard. Right. Um, so, you know, again, I'm, I read with Emmett this morning, um, who's four in, in English. Um, and you know, I, a word like again, right. Where, um, the, uh, the A initially in again makes a, uh, um, versus apple, right.</p><p>Makes ah. So he has to know that in again, it's a, and in apple it's ah. And, and so he, you know, sees again, and he says, ah, again, right. Uh, which is totally understandable, even though we don't normally say that, um, in Greek and Hebrew, both there is a, um, basically a one-to-one correspondence.</p><p>I mean, it's like, uh, there's like a few exceptions, but it's so much closer. So when you see a certain letter, you're always going to say a certain sound. Um, and that just makes it way, way easier to, to learn to read. Um, so, so that, that, and that really is the struggle for especially young readers, right.</p><p>Is they have to figure out in English, all of these different rules, um, that are, that are very, very difficult. They can speak, you know, English just fine. Um, but once they get that into the, into, um, text, it's very hard. Uh, whereas with Greek and Hebrew, you know, if you can sound out the word, um, every single time, all you have to do is learn, um, you know, basically what that, what that sound, what those sounds mean, right.</p><p>Um, what those sounds mean and what, what word is behind those sounds. And then, you know, you can, you can just read much, much faster. Yeah. That makes a lot of sense. I am currently in a season where I'm holding up the flashcard, telling him, ah, Apple knowing and having to quiet my mind, as I say, but I know you'll be frustrated with me.</p><p>So I'm going to say a Apple to you and give this card to you and have you make a face at me. Um, and we'll just move on because we got to get these letter sounds down. Um, and so I think that might be a really comforting and encouraging thing for a person because of, of course, in our, in our Western context, specifically in America, it is a little bit more rare to learn Hebrew and Greek.</p><p>Most people here learn Spanish or maybe French or, or maybe even German, which is pretty similar to English in some regards. Um, and so I think just dissipating some of those thoughts that make you think, okay, this one's going to be so much more difficult than the rest. And even though I love the Lord and I want to be able to read my Bible, I just don't know where my entry point would be, um, could be really helpful and encouraging for parents.</p><p>Something that you didn't mention that I'm wondering about as we're sort of rounding the bend on this conversation is the direction of reading. Um, I'm curious to know if that also makes Hebrew a slightly softer entry point. Like, is it true that people do prefer to read one direction or over another and that the brain is designed a specific way or is that a myth?</p><p>Yeah, that's an interesting question. There, there has been, um, you know, work on, uh, the, basically the brains of people who are reading Hebrew versus reading in English. Um, one reason being that, um, in Hebrew you read right to left. Um, I, I would say that if you, um, you know, if you learn to read English first and which is left to right, you will have an easier time with other languages that are left to right.</p><p>Um, so that's one reason why I would say that Greek is an, is like a smoother entry point. There's also a lot, like in Greek, there's a lot of, um, carryover between the letters in, uh, English. So, you know, for example, I, we, um, are regularly at homeschool conferences and we were at the teach them diligently conferences past, uh, weekend.</p><p>And, um, you know, basically at the conference, I, I have this, um, our, this, well, the app pulled up and I can teach people to read, you know, a Greek word in 20 seconds, right. It's, it's, it's technon. Um, and I could do the same in Hebrew, but like if I typed out technon for you in, uh, in Greek, you could probably be fine.</p><p>Um, you mean you, you, even if you didn't know, um, any Greek, like you would, that you, you would guess something close to that. Whereas in Hebrew, um, the vowels are written, um, underneath and above letters, the consonants. Um, so that's different. You're obviously reading from right to left and there's, there's way less carryover between, um, you know, what the, what the letters look like in Hebrew versus what they look like in English.</p><p>Um, so all that to say, um, both are, are very possible. And like I said, there, there's still way easier than English. Um, I, I would say that if you, if you are wanting, if you say, give me the easier language first, um, at least to start out with, uh, I would say it's, it's Greek.</p><p>Um, you can start to read Greek very, very quickly. Um, but both are, are possible for sure. Yeah. And both are useful. Yes. Um, and I want to maybe in our conversation here, because more than believing that something is easy or accessible, I think if you believe that it is important, um, you'll, you'll work through a lot of hurdles you may not have ordinarily, um, gone through.</p><p>And I, I know that you told me you originally started this because you wanted to help people to translate the word of God. And then you identified, Hey, this isn't just for scholars, and this isn't just for translation. This is for everyone. Can you talk to me a little bit about the value of knowing God's word and preserving it in the English language, in the English language?</p><p>Huh? That's not what we're discussing. Knowing it and preserving it in the original language. Yeah. So, I mean, I would say, um, you know, it, it, it really is the foundation of the gospel. You know, the, the, um, Greek and Hebrew just happen to be the languages. I mean, they're not special languages, right?</p><p>They just happen to be the languages, um, that God has, you know, spoken in. And, um, you know, I think Martin Luther talks about, uh, how, you know, one of the things that sparked the reformation was the study of the Bible in the original languages. Um, you had, um, more access to the, um, to the Greek and Hebrew Bibles, um, than ever before, right around that time.</p><p>And people started reading it for themselves. Um, and, and that shaped, you know, um, you know, a lot of, um, I mean, history, right. Um, and again, there, I think there's, you know, um, certain pros and cons that came from, from the, uh, reformation, but, but at the end of the day, um, people went back to these texts and, um, they looked at it with fresh eyes and they, they said, how, how do we understand this and how do we obey this?</p><p>Um, and ultimately, uh, you know, what you said, right. Is it, it's important. Uh, my, my point is that that's worth doing, right. Um, it's, it's hard. It's not that hard. Right. And today we have, um, so many resources out there to learn these languages and we want it to be more accessible and easier for everyone so that, you know, you can say, Hey, um, this is really important.</p><p>And now I know what to do, how to go about learning these languages. Um, so that ultimately I can read the text more faithfully and live my life more faithfully. Um, again, it's not to say that you can't as a, as an English speaker. Um, but you know, you, you will never get to the depth that you can if you know these languages.</p><p>Um, so that's, that's really what, what we're about is, you know, these are the most important texts ever written. Um, why not take the time, learn the languages, um, and encounter God in a new way. Yeah. And I mean, there's so, there are so many things that we could talk about guys.</p><p>I want you to go and research if you don't know about, you know, just how, how important the Bible, the actual text of the Bible is for all other historians in all of time. I mean, when you compare what we have in these original source texts to what we have of even Shakespeare or any other book that we teach in quote school, um, it's astounding what the Lord has done to preserve his word.</p><p>And so for us to, to not want to continue to make that happen, um, kind of makes you want to pause and think twice. So for people who are saying, okay, I'm in, I get it. It's important. I want to do it too. Uh, where should they go? I know you have a podcast.</p><p>There's a website. Give us the whole rundown for how we can get started with Biblingo. Yeah. I mean, so the easiest thing honestly, um, is to go to our website, biblingo.org. Um, you can, um, there is a homeschool page there that you can look at, uh, all the homeschool plans on.</p><p>Um, we also do have a partnership with CC. So you can find us on the curriculum partners, I think, um, on, on CC's website. Um, but biblingo.org, you can sign up for, for a free trial 10 days and just try it out. Um, like I said, you know, my encouragement would just be to, um, just be consistent, keep going.</p><p>Um, the, the, our podcast is honestly very, very, um, scholarly. We talk about all kinds of, uh, you know, um, very high level scholarly things. Um, it's called the biblical languages podcast. So if you're, if you're, um, you know, kids are in high school and they really are digging it, uh, they can, they can do that.</p><p>Um, but I would say, you know, more than that is, is just, um, trying it out for yourself. Um, we do have a YouTube channel too, that we post more popular level stuff on. Um, so that'd be another place to, to check us out on. Um, but, but really, um, I, more than any of that, um, if, if you can just, um, try it and, and keep going, I think you will see the dividends, um, as you, you know, progress through the app.</p><p>I love it. Try it and keep going. You know, don't just try it for a day. Don't just try it for two days, stay committed and you'll, you'll see the payoff. Well, Kevin, thank you so much for talking to us about this. Thank you for your investment. Um, and even just the body of Christ to do this and make this accessible for people is a big deal.</p><p>So I appreciate it. And I hope that you have a great day. Thanks. My pleasure. It was great to talk. you you you you you you you Thank you.</p></div></div></body></html>
