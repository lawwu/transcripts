But as these other modalities become</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZS5gNElZM&t=569" target="_blank">00:09:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">more controllable and also less costly, we should see all of them.

And then, usefully for all of us,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZS5gNElZM&t=595" target="_blank">00:09:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">that market for model capabilities is getting more competitive, not less. Sam Altman himself, I think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZS5gNElZM&t=603" target="_blank">00:10:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">said it best.

The distilled versions of that are, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZS5gNElZM&t=619" target="_blank">00:10:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">now 10 cents.

A million to 100</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZS5gNElZM&t=695" target="_blank">00:11:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">million of ARR in 12 months and half a million developers.

That's not growth. That is a killer application. Cognition, which started with more autonomy, is already the top</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZS5gNElZM&t=707" target="_blank">00:11:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">committer in many companies.

And then Windsurf, who's on a tear itself and really beloved, is being acquired by OpenAI for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZS5gNElZM&t=717" target="_blank">00:11:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">three billion dollars.

So, you know, our ranks are expanding. And I think it's useful to just, like, analyze a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZS5gNElZM&t=739" target="_blank">00:12:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">bit why code was first. Fundamentally, it is text with its, like, logical language with structure. Right? So much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZS5gNElZM&t=748" target="_blank">00:12:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">of coding is sophisticated boilerplate. Like, we all love engineering, but some of it is, like, craft work,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZS5gNElZM&t=754" target="_blank">00:12:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">not new algorithm work. You don't need AGI to write, like, an API endpoint or a React component.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZS5gNElZM&t=762" target="_blank">00:12:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Second, you have deterministic validation. You can automatically check if code works. Run tests,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZS5gNElZM&t=768" target="_blank">00:12:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">compile, execute, do things developers would do. And third, researchers believe code is crucial for AGI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZS5gNElZM&t=775" target="_blank">00:12:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? So they poured resources into it. And code became a key benchmark and a training priority and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZS5gNElZM&t=782" target="_blank">00:13:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">an area for data collection. But I think the last point is the money point to me. Engineers built tools</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZS5gNElZM&t=789" target="_blank">00:13:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">for engineers. They understood the workflow intimately, and that made all the difference. And that last part</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZS5gNElZM&t=794" target="_blank">00:13:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">is the playbook for every other industry. I'm sure people are building things that serve beyond engineers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZS5gNElZM&t=800" target="_blank">00:13:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And I don't think the winners will just be AI experts learning those domains. They'll be customer-centric,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZS5gNElZM&t=806" target="_blank">00:13:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">like, problem-centric builders who understand AI and then redesign workflows from first principles around</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZS5gNElZM&t=812" target="_blank">00:13:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">manipulating those models. And so I think that's really the opportunity to build Cursor for X. Let's think a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZS5gNElZM&t=818" target="_blank">00:13:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">little bit about what that means. Cursor is not a single model. You know, one model's doing diffs, one's doing merge, one's embedding the files.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZS5gNElZM&t=826" target="_blank">00:13:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">They manipulate and package up the context. They prompt the models very skillfully. They let engineers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZS5gNElZM&t=833" target="_blank">00:13:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">avoid repetitive tasks and standardize with things like Cursor rules. And then if you're using Cursor</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZS5gNElZM&t=839" target="_blank">00:13:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">in a team or even yourself, regularly retrieval accuracy gets better the more you use it with coverage and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZS5gNElZM&t=844" target="_blank">00:14:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">freshness. And so all of this happens in a UX that makes sense. Right? Like, I use VS Code. I'm familiar with it. My shortcuts work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZS5gNElZM&t=851" target="_blank">00:14:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And they make it safe to say yes. Right? Like, green for add and red for subtract makes sense. I can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZS5gNElZM&t=858" target="_blank">00:14:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">scroll through it. And it's fast enough that I don't get frustrated. So my view is Cursor, if it's a wrapper,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZS5gNElZM&t=865" target="_blank">00:14:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">it's like a very nice, thick, perhaps 14 or 15 billion dollar wrapper. Right? It's like if your burrito was 80%</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZS5gNElZM&t=872" target="_blank">00:14:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">wrap and 20% fill, but you got to choose the fill and there's like an empty, like an open market for fill.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZS5gNElZM&t=878" target="_blank">00:14:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? And so where's the value now? It may not be in the protein. It's kind of in the company.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZS5gNElZM&t=884" target="_blank">00:14:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So, like, if we try to generalize that recipe a little bit, if you are building a generic text box,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZS5gNElZM&t=893" target="_blank">00:14:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">like, unless you're just like learning to do this, please don't.

Right? So I do not think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZS5gNElZM&t=925" target="_blank">00:15:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">this is the end of the GUI.

Like, ChatGPT, you know, crushed the first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZS5gNElZM&t=1316" target="_blank">00:21:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">iteration pretty quickly. And so I don't think this is satisfying advice, but I think it is, like, real from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZS5gNElZM&t=1321" target="_blank">00:22:01.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the trenches.

And that advantage is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZS5gNElZM&t=1340" target="_blank">00:22:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, open for the taking and not for the labs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZS5gNElZM&t=1343" target="_blank">00:22:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So I guess in conclusion, I think the opportunity is early and really massive. Like, I've made a career bet</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZS5gNElZM&t=1351" target="_blank">00:22:31.120</a></span> | <span class="t">on it.

And the game board keeps getting shaken up. That's the thing that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MZS5gNElZM&t=1378" target="_blank">00:22:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">different this time, right?
