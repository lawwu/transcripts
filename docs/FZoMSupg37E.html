And access here means calling APIs, pulling data, using</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.620</a></span> | <span class="t">tokens, touching credentials, and keys.

And there's other OAuth risks too, like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.720</a></span> | <span class="t">sensitive data exposure, but that often comes back to the same root cause. If an agent reaches</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">it into something it shouldn't, it's usually because no one told it not to.

They're actually doing real things, calling APIs, kicking off workflows,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.040</a></span> | <span class="t">changing your systems. And that means they're moving through your stack, touching real user</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.460</a></span> | <span class="t">data, interacting with real external systems. And all needs to happen under the right context,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.300</a></span> | <span class="t">not just on behalf of your app, but on behalf of your users, individuals. Here's what this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.940</a></span> | <span class="t">looks like in practice. On the left, you see a pattern that's very common, and an agent calling</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">an API using a shared key pulled from an environmental variable. That key probably gets reused across</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">users, environments, maybe even different services. It works, but it's fragile. You can't tell who did what,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.260</a></span> | <span class="t">and rotating secrets and keys is manual and risky. And the access is way too broad. On the right,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.500</a></span> | <span class="t">things are looking better. Instead of a shared static key, the agent asks your back end for a token</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.020</a></span> | <span class="t">that's just for the one user and one API. The back end uses something like token exchange to hand out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.860</a></span> | <span class="t">short-lived token, and the agent can safely use that. Now you've got a real record of who did what,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.260</a></span> | <span class="t">and you can easily rotate tokens, support multiple upstream systems, and manage all of this in a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.300</a></span> | <span class="t">centralized way. And we've seen that this approach scales much better, even if you have dozens or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.140</a></span> | <span class="t">hundreds of agents. It's a small tweak in your flow, but a big step up in how you handle risk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So we've talked about the secrets and shared credentials problem, but underneath it all is identity. If your agent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.260</a></span> | <span class="t">doesn't have identity, it doesn't matter how well you scope your tokens or rotate tokens, you still</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.140</a></span> | <span class="t">don't have real control here. And identity is what connects actions to users. It lets you understand what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.740</a></span> | <span class="t">happened, trace the activity, and decide what should happen next. But before we talk about delegation and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.380</a></span> | <span class="t">scope, we need to get identity right. So if identity is the part we're often missing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.140</a></span> | <span class="t">the next question is, who's the agent actually working for? If you don't have a clear answer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.300</a></span> | <span class="t">chances are it's just running as a service account. And that's how you get the confused deputy problem</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.340</a></span> | <span class="t">that you've been hearing a lot about this week. The agent has access, but it doesn't know who it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.060</a></span> | <span class="t">acting for, what it should avoid. The fix is to anchor that behavior into real users using standard flows like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.940</a></span> | <span class="t">OAuth 2.1, RAR, and token exchange to tightly control what the agent can do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.860</a></span> | <span class="t">That includes refreshing tokens properly and preserving upstream identity. And here's how it works in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.780</a></span> | <span class="t">practice. When the agent needs to act, it doesn't grab a key from a static config. Instead, it asks your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.940</a></span> | <span class="t">backend for help. The backend reaches into a vault, fetches a credential, and uses token exchange to mint a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=329" target="_blank">00:05:29.460</a></span> | <span class="t">token that's short-lived just for this user in API. That token never sits with the agent. It's handed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.540</a></span> | <span class="t">off, used, and gone. And this keeps your agent focused on doing its job, not carrying around secrets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And it lines up with familiar OAuth standards, so you're not inventing the wheel, what you should never</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=345" target="_blank">00:05:45.700</a></span> | <span class="t">do with identity.

This is where fine-grained authorization matters.

You also need to control when and how that access is provisioned. That's where client-initiated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=393" target="_blank">00:06:33.940</a></span> | <span class="t">back-channel authentication, which is a mouthful, or CBA comes in. Instead of showing a UI, the agent sends a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.060</a></span> | <span class="t">request to the authorization server. The server reaches out to the user on a trusted device via something like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=407" target="_blank">00:06:47.380</a></span> | <span class="t">a push notification.

All right. So to bring this all together, Cam's going to show what this looks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=479" target="_blank">00:07:59.380</a></span> | <span class="t">like in practice. He's going to go through the CBA flow, an example. Cam, over to you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=483" target="_blank">00:08:03.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Thanks, Bobby.

Building on that overview, you can actually find this demo alongside of a ton</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=500" target="_blank">00:08:20.020</a></span> | <span class="t">of other really great working demos at the following URL that I've got highlighted in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=504" target="_blank">00:08:24.260</a></span> | <span class="t">package.json of this little application. For our scenario, we're going to do a local AI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.460</a></span> | <span class="t">trading assistant that's going to make local tool calls to a broker service in order to buy stock.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=513" target="_blank">00:08:33.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? We tried to make this as applicable as possible. The AI agent is going to initiate the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=518" target="_blank">00:08:38.420</a></span> | <span class="t">request, but the user is going to have to explicitly approve it before it's executed. I don't have enough</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=522" target="_blank">00:08:42.900</a></span> | <span class="t">screens. I'm going to pull another one up. This will be really fun. Bear with me. All right. So this is going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=528" target="_blank">00:08:48.020</a></span> | <span class="t">to really emphasize three critical components for us. So we're going to have user identification and context,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=533" target="_blank">00:08:53.220</a></span> | <span class="t">which is going to identify the user so that the agent can act on their behalf.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=536" target="_blank">00:08:56.260</a></span> | <span class="t">We're going to use the token vault to prevent us from embedding any kind of like, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=541" target="_blank">00:09:01.140</a></span> | <span class="t">secrets or sensitive data inside of our actual code. And then we're going to use SEBA or client</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=545" target="_blank">00:09:05.700</a></span> | <span class="t">initiated back-channel authentication to request user consent before the agent executes sensitive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=550" target="_blank">00:09:10.580</a></span> | <span class="t">actions. It's worth highlighting, this is going to require an identity provider that supports SEBA.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=554" target="_blank">00:09:14.740</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, our Auth0 is the company we work for. But importantly, like SEBA is part of the OIDC</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=560" target="_blank">00:09:20.340</a></span> | <span class="t">specification.

Okay. So we're using a pretty simple TypeScript CLI application.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=578" target="_blank">00:09:38.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Anybody speak TypeScript in the room?

All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=581" target="_blank">00:09:41.940</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. The Python demo will come later. So this is basically just going to expose a command line</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=588" target="_blank">00:09:48.260</a></span> | <span class="t">interface for the user, which is configured with a stock trading tool. Let me make sure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=594" target="_blank">00:09:54.260</a></span> | <span class="t">that a couple of prereqs that I need are true. Bear with me one second.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=600" target="_blank">00:10:00.580</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. I do not see what I'm looking for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=609" target="_blank">00:10:09.460</a></span> | <span class="t">But that should be fine, hopefully. So rolling back in a more mature trading environment,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=616" target="_blank">00:10:16.260</a></span> | <span class="t">it would probably look something like this. So you'll have this user who's going to specify,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=620" target="_blank">00:10:20.420</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, buy some stock at a certain threshold, which will get dispensed as a user action</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=624" target="_blank">00:10:24.980</a></span> | <span class="t">that'll interface with your chat bot. There'd be some sort of polling system that would be capable</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=630" target="_blank">00:10:30.020</a></span> | <span class="t">of understanding what, like, the real-time value of that stock trade is over time. And then it would,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=634" target="_blank">00:10:34.260</a></span> | <span class="t">at the time where whatever threshold is defined, at that point, it would then execute the trade. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=639" target="_blank">00:10:39.300</a></span> | <span class="t">prior to executing the trade, it would dispatch a CBA request to make sure that the user is able to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=643" target="_blank">00:10:43.060</a></span> | <span class="t">authenticate that, right, at the last mile. Now, with today's stock volatility being what it is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=648" target="_blank">00:10:48.180</a></span> | <span class="t">it'd be a real challenge to define any reliable trade rule based on vibes and true social posts. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=652" target="_blank">00:10:52.340</a></span> | <span class="t">we're going to elide certain elements of this stack. That was a joke. I hope you enjoyed that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=656" target="_blank">00:10:56.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Stay on the script now. So we're going to take a look at the actual application. So this is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=662" target="_blank">00:11:02.020</a></span> | <span class="t">primary agent configuration and runtime definition inside of this stack. You can see it's bifurcated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=667" target="_blank">00:11:07.380</a></span> | <span class="t">into two primary methods. You've got the generate messages method, which is basically the handler</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=671" target="_blank">00:11:11.780</a></span> | <span class="t">that's interfacing between the LLM and the user. Here we're passing in this buy tool, which we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=675" target="_blank">00:11:15.860</a></span> | <span class="t">going to dig into a little bit more. Then subsequent to that, you have the main method, which is going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=680" target="_blank">00:11:20.660</a></span> | <span class="t">to run on the main thread. Here's where we're going to define the context and bind it to a particular</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=684" target="_blank">00:11:24.820</a></span> | <span class="t">thread for this particular session. This is going to give us the ability to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=688" target="_blank">00:11:28.580</a></span> | <span class="t">durably identify who is using this particular session.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=694" target="_blank">00:11:34.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So within that, let's take a look at the actual tool call.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=698" target="_blank">00:11:38.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So here we have the definition of a tool call instead of this application. You'll note that it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=705" target="_blank">00:11:45.940</a></span> | <span class="t">wrapped in two higher order component functions. So there's this use device flow. Take a look at that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=711" target="_blank">00:11:51.700</a></span> | <span class="t">This is basically how it is that we are bootstrapping the OIDC wrapper within this application.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=719" target="_blank">00:11:59.060</a></span> | <span class="t">That's going to enable us to have an auth client bootstrap for the application. This enables me to use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=723" target="_blank">00:12:03.780</a></span> | <span class="t">access tokens on behalf of a user, basically. So there's a whole lot of configuration that goes into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=727" target="_blank">00:12:07.620</a></span> | <span class="t">that. Stepping back, there's another handler, this use CBA high order component. So this is basically going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=733" target="_blank">00:12:13.460</a></span> | <span class="t">enable this application to intercept the tool call in which we want the user to be able to approve or deny</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=740" target="_blank">00:12:20.180</a></span> | <span class="t">behavior. And that's really the heart of CBA. It's also where we provide configuration information to our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=744" target="_blank">00:12:24.900</a></span> | <span class="t">identity provider about how we're going to use the resources. So in our case, we're using a blocking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=749" target="_blank">00:12:29.140</a></span> | <span class="t">callback down here, which is going to actually pause the application while it's running in order to wait for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=756" target="_blank">00:12:36.020</a></span> | <span class="t">the approval. You could wire this up with an asynchronous flow or polling or however you wanted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=760" target="_blank">00:12:40.500</a></span> | <span class="t">to. But for the sake of this demo, this was a lot easier. One last thing that I'll highlight here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=765" target="_blank">00:12:45.860</a></span> | <span class="t">inside of the buy tool call, the way that we're handling credentials here on line 28, this prevents</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=771" target="_blank">00:12:51.140</a></span> | <span class="t">us from embedding client secrets directly inside of the code, which is a nice utility method. In Auth0,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=777" target="_blank">00:12:57.300</a></span> | <span class="t">we call this our token vault. It's dissimilar from like one password or like a credential manager.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=782" target="_blank">00:13:02.180</a></span> | <span class="t">This is managing tokens, not credentials. So just a little bit of a note there. So let's get these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=786" target="_blank">00:13:06.580</a></span> | <span class="t">services running. Fingers crossed we don't run into any super fun Wi-Fi issues. May the Wi-Fi gods be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=794" target="_blank">00:13:14.020</a></span> | <span class="t">forever on our side. As that comes up, so even with local AI agents, identity matters, especially when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=799" target="_blank">00:13:19.860</a></span> | <span class="t">you're using multiple users with multiple agents involved or if the agent has access to, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=805" target="_blank">00:13:25.780</a></span> | <span class="t">user data or user files, right? So it's crucial to know who is interacting with what and at what time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=811" target="_blank">00:13:31.780</a></span> | <span class="t">especially like once compliance gets into this, it gets a lot more robust. So we're not using a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=817" target="_blank">00:13:37.300</a></span> | <span class="t">fully stateful service to preserve and persist the user's identity. So instead, we're going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=821" target="_blank">00:13:41.460</a></span> | <span class="t">authenticate the users through the UI. So you'll notice that a little blurb will pop up. After that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=825" target="_blank">00:13:45.460</a></span> | <span class="t">when the AI agent needs to perform a sensitive action, like executing a trade, we're going to rely on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=829" target="_blank">00:13:49.220</a></span> | <span class="t">SEBA. That means no additional user-facing UI is required after the user has given us their tokens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=834" target="_blank">00:13:54.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'll give you a little bit of a demo of that. So we're definitely aware that identity standards like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=839" target="_blank">00:13:59.140</a></span> | <span class="t">OAuth 2, OIDC, SEBA, these are not always top of mind or super interesting for developers when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=843" target="_blank">00:14:03.700</a></span> | <span class="t">you're building great applications. That's why we're highlighting that there are solutions to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=846" target="_blank">00:14:06.900</a></span> | <span class="t">these problems. There's open standards that are evolving over time. And a lot of those are live</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=851" target="_blank">00:14:11.220</a></span> | <span class="t">today. So that can be something to be thought of in the progenation of an application instead of as an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=856" target="_blank">00:14:16.500</a></span> | <span class="t">afterthought. So one thing that we run into repeatedly while building this demo is determining just how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=860" target="_blank">00:14:20.660</a></span> | <span class="t">much complexity is needed to effectively showcase these sorts of scenarios. Please let us know how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=867" target="_blank">00:14:27.220</a></span> | <span class="t">we struck that balance. You can email Bobby directly. He loves feedback. All right. So now for the fun</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=873" target="_blank">00:14:33.140</a></span> | <span class="t">part, let's try and buy some stocks with this. If the Wi-Fi gods are on our side. So buy me 10 stocks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=879" target="_blank">00:14:39.220</a></span> | <span class="t">as well. So what this is going to do is the LLM is going to process the intent and it's going to select</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=887" target="_blank">00:14:47.540</a></span> | <span class="t">the buy stock tool. The agent is going to send... I love Wi-Fi. It's my favorite thing. Let's see if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=894" target="_blank">00:14:54.900</a></span> | <span class="t">there isn't a way around... I can just sort of talk through this at a high level. We'll take a look at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=901" target="_blank">00:15:01.060</a></span> | <span class="t">this piece of our demo. So what would have, you know, ideally happened is we would execute that trade</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=910" target="_blank">00:15:10.420</a></span> | <span class="t">because we have bootstrapped our middleware inside of this application. It would prompt me to log in. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=914" target="_blank">00:15:14.260</a></span> | <span class="t">once I logged in, then the agent would have tokens to use on my behalf as a user. That would then execute</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=919" target="_blank">00:15:19.140</a></span> | <span class="t">a trade. It's not actually executing a trade. I have like a local trade service running. So you're not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=922" target="_blank">00:15:22.660</a></span> | <span class="t">missing many highlights. Don't worry. And then once the trade, or once I authenticated, then CBA would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=929" target="_blank">00:15:29.700</a></span> | <span class="t">immediately dispatch a notification to Auth0's backend and it would blow up my phone and I would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=934" target="_blank">00:15:34.020</a></span> | <span class="t">get a little notification that's like, "Hey, would you like to approve and authorize this trade?" One</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=938" target="_blank">00:15:38.900</a></span> | <span class="t">nice thing about the notification that I get is it's not just going to tell me, "Hey, something happened.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=942" target="_blank">00:15:42.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Would you like to approve it?" And I'm just going to be left generically in the middle of the ether trying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=946" target="_blank">00:15:46.580</a></span> | <span class="t">to figure out where this notification came from. It's actually going to say, "This agent tried to do this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=951" target="_blank">00:15:51.220</a></span> | <span class="t">action," which in this case is purchasing 10 shares of something. "On your behalf, would you like to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=955" target="_blank">00:15:55.300</a></span> | <span class="t">approve that downstream flow?" And then I have the autonomy as an end user to determine whether or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=960" target="_blank">00:16:00.740</a></span> | <span class="t">not I'm going to advance that flow or cancel that flow. One other thing that I would have shown is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=965" target="_blank">00:16:05.220</a></span> | <span class="t">once I've authenticated the agent to act on my behalf, subsequent trades no longer need me in the loop</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=970" target="_blank">00:16:10.100</a></span> | <span class="t">outside of the CBA flow. So once I've authenticated in, the authorization flow is then just dispatched</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=976" target="_blank">00:16:16.420</a></span> | <span class="t">to CBA, which is pretty cool. So going back to my notes, let me see how many things that I missed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=982" target="_blank">00:16:22.420</a></span> | <span class="t">A bunch of things, but that's okay. So in summary, we saw, well, kind of, I talked through how an agent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=988" target="_blank">00:16:28.580</a></span> | <span class="t">can identify and act on behalf of a specific user, how to store and access credentials securely, and how to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=993" target="_blank">00:16:33.940</a></span> | <span class="t">use CBA to get explicit user approval for high-risk actions like trading without a browser to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=999" target="_blank">00:16:39.540</a></span> | <span class="t">required. So these patterns are live. They exist in defined standards like OIDC, CBA, rich authorization</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=1005" target="_blank">00:16:45.860</a></span> | <span class="t">requests, Auth0 developer previews have, like, attempts at a lot of these things or actual production</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=1011" target="_blank">00:16:51.780</a></span> | <span class="t">versions of a lot of these things. So I'd encourage you guys to check some of those things out. And some of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=1015" target="_blank">00:16:55.700</a></span> | <span class="t">these are GA, like our CBA, I believe is GA, or at least in early access, instead of our platform. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=1020" target="_blank">00:17:00.740</a></span> | <span class="t">that's pretty cool. Thanks. That's my demo. All right. So just moving back here, go to the next slide.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=1027" target="_blank">00:17:07.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Cool. But as Cam was saying, like, we're trying to make this easier for developers. The standards are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=1036" target="_blank">00:17:16.180</a></span> | <span class="t">great. It means you're not reinventing things over and over again. But there's still a lot of building</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=1041" target="_blank">00:17:21.380</a></span> | <span class="t">blocks that you would have to build. The Auth0, other platforms have similar things. But we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=1046" target="_blank">00:17:26.980</a></span> | <span class="t">trying to wrap this all up in a nice experience for developers. So the async user confirmation with CBA</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=1052" target="_blank">00:17:32.980</a></span> | <span class="t">is, like, a very key component here, as well as calling APIs on BAP users, things like token exchange</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=1059" target="_blank">00:17:39.380</a></span> | <span class="t">and token vault, as well as fine-grained authorization for RAG. You don't have to use our platform for this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=1065" target="_blank">00:17:45.060</a></span> | <span class="t">We have OpenFGA that can snap into this type of thing as well. And user authentication and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=1072" target="_blank">00:17:52.260</a></span> | <span class="t">authorization generally is something that we do. We think deeply about. And with that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=1077" target="_blank">00:17:57.860</a></span> | <span class="t">here's what you can take with you. It's a nice QR code. And we'd love to talk to anyone who's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=1085" target="_blank">00:18:05.780</a></span> | <span class="t">struggling with these challenges, what you've hit in your day-to-day life. Just come talk to us after the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=1093" target="_blank">00:18:13.220</a></span> | <span class="t">talk. I'm also part of the open MCP spec, driving some of those discussions as well. We're very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=1101" target="_blank">00:18:21.460</a></span> | <span class="t">interested in improving that for everybody. So it's not just about Auth0, working with other open source</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=1107" target="_blank">00:18:27.940</a></span> | <span class="t">libraries like MCP auth, which is another great thing. So very deeply interested in this space.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=1113" target="_blank">00:18:33.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Thanks. Thank you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=1115" target="_blank">00:18:35.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Thanks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZoMSupg37E&t=1117" target="_blank">00:18:37.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you.</span></div></div></body></html>
