I put this up frequently.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=20" target="_blank">00:00:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">How was the experience?

So you said it's a lot quicker than you thought it would be. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=34" target="_blank">00:00:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Is this a number you can call? Sure. I don't know if you have one phone call you want to call an AI,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=43" target="_blank">00:00:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">but whatever floats your boat. So we're going to make this live. Yeah. It's kind of fun. So I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=51" target="_blank">00:00:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">just messing around with VAPI. It's one of these like YC startups, there's like five of these.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=57" target="_blank">00:00:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So don't particularly create this as like an endorsement, but they are very, very easy to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=61" target="_blank">00:01:01.040</a></span> | <span class="t">work with.

I think it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=68" target="_blank">00:01:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">like voice API. And so we're just going to create a personal AI. I think I can just kind of create</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=73" target="_blank">00:01:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">like a blank template and we can just call this like, I don't know, latent space pod. I don't know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=81" target="_blank">00:01:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">It doesn't actually matter. And we can do like a system prompt, right? Like you answer in pirates</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=90" target="_blank">00:01:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">speak something. And then we can publish and then we can start calling it. I don't know if the voice</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=97" target="_blank">00:01:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">actually works. Oh, by the way, we have no volume control on this thing. So it's going to come over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=101" target="_blank">00:01:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the speakers really loudly and we cannot control that, but it'll be short. For some reason it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">not connecting. Oh, it wants to use my microphone. Hello. All right. Let's try calling it again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Is this working?

Your voice be echoing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">through loud and clear. What can this old seadog do for you today? Oh my God. Can you tell us how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.720</a></span> | <span class="t">to turn down the volume in AWS loft? If you want to adjust the volume, you'll be in a bit of a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">pickle. It doesn't have a volume control. I thought this was a super nice experience. You</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">set up a voice thing. You can connect a phone number to it if you buy a phone number. That's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=155" target="_blank">00:02:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the experience that you saw if you call this number. And you can customize it however you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">like, whatever system message you have. On my live stream that I did last week, I added memory</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">to this thing. So if you call it back, ideally you should just remember the previous conversation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">you had. And then you have a personal AI. It doesn't take that long. I just did it one handed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, it's pretty great. It's actually built, today I discovered it's built on the ground,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">which is Damien's next talk. So I'll hand it over to Damien while he comes over and sets up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Welcome to Damien. Oh, and then Igor, if you want to come up and share your setup.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so I was going to share my personal setup. Am I the only person in the room recording right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">now? I see this whole, perfect, cool. Yeah, this is a recording okay meetup,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.720</a></span> | <span class="t">right? Yes. Something I want to do for my conference in June is everything should be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">default recording and then you opt out. Yeah, absolutely, absolutely. So what I do is I record</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">all my life, constantly, 24/7. I have two setups, two recorders, and I live in the Netherlands,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">which allows me to record people without the explicit constant because it's legal in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Netherlands. If you have any private conversation, you are just allowed to record if you're not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">allowed to share. So that's cool. And yeah, my personal setup is pretty simple. This is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">recorder. It's running all the time. I have quite a number of use cases for it already,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and I also, but the main goal for me is to create a huge data set on my life. One year of my life</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">is less than to share a bunch of data or like one year of audio is less than to share a bunch of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">data and we absolutely can afford just saving all this stuff and then mine is data for important</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">insights. For example, I have really interesting and lovely conversations with my friends and I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">use it. I just dump them on my audio player and just can listen to the best conversations with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">my friends on the player. It's incredible. But I also talk a lot to myself when I'm alone and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm just explaining this future self, the context of my life and how is my life started and what is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">going on. I also record all my therapy sessions. Well, I record everything and I'm pretty sure it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.720</a></span> | <span class="t">something that will help me to align in AI with myself because I will have this huge data set.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=305" target="_blank">00:05:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I call this interpersonal alignment because there is this gross alignment problem, but I also want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">AI to know me really, really well, to understand me in the proper context and how to help me to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">succeed. I think this data set I created is really valuable. And all of you who are not recording</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">right now, I think you should. Even if you're not going to use it right now, you'll just have this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">data. There is no good reason not to have this data. It's a recording 4K me time. I think you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">should. If you have your Apple Watch, just open audio noise and start recording. Start recording</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">conversations you have. It's super easy to do. You can just take your phone out of the pocket</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=347" target="_blank">00:05:47.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and just record stuff.

To me, that's actually what a meetup should be like, that people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=357" target="_blank">00:05:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">bring their stuff and they talk about their passions, what they're working on.

When I'm done recording, I can click it. It transcribes it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=378" target="_blank">00:06:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">saves the file, and then offers me to do a summary right after.

So hey, everybody.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=458" target="_blank">00:07:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Damian Murphy. I work as an applied engineer at DeepGround. What an applied engineer is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=464" target="_blank">00:07:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">is it's basically a customer-focused engineer. So we work directly with startups like yourselves,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=470" target="_blank">00:07:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and we help you build voice-enabled apps. What I'm going to show you today is really around</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=477" target="_blank">00:07:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">how to build essentially what you saw with Vapi, but using open-source software. So being able to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=484" target="_blank">00:08:04.240</a></span> | <span class="t">make something like Vapi yourself. Some of the main considerations when you're building a real-time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=489" target="_blank">00:08:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">voice bot is performance, accuracy, and cost, and being able to scale. You want everything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=496" target="_blank">00:08:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">with a real-time voice bot. When you called it, you had sub-second response time. So being able</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=501" target="_blank">00:08:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to get that sub-second response time is super important. So essentially, if you go beyond,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=507" target="_blank">00:08:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">say, 1.5, 2 seconds, a lot of people will actually say something again. They think that the person is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=512" target="_blank">00:08:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">no longer there on the other end. And you need to do that for speech-to-text, the language model,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=518" target="_blank">00:08:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and the text-to-speech. And then on the accuracy, so you want to be able to understand what the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=522" target="_blank">00:08:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">person says regardless of their accent. And you want to be able to do that in multiple languages</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=528" target="_blank">00:08:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">as well. And then on the TTS side, really being able to be human-like, that's the big challenge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=536" target="_blank">00:08:56.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And then cost and scale. So you can build a lot of this stuff with off-the-shelf,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=541" target="_blank">00:09:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">open-source software. And probably the text-to-speech stuff won't be fast enough,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=546" target="_blank">00:09:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">or the transcription won't be fast enough. But you can actually do a lot of this with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=551" target="_blank">00:09:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">managed solutions as well. I'll go into the unit economics towards the end.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=555" target="_blank">00:09:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So yeah, this is the basic setup. So you have a browser that's going to send audio. Obviously,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=562" target="_blank">00:09:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">you need to interact with the browser to capture audio. That's one of the requirements for security</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=568" target="_blank">00:09:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">reasons. So you'll see a lot of these demos, you have to click a button to actually initiate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=572" target="_blank">00:09:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">speech. The VoiceBot server, it's actually repeated here multiple times just to kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=578" target="_blank">00:09:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">simplify things. But you can imagine this as a back and forth. You're doing browser to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=583" target="_blank">00:09:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">VoiceBot server to get the audio, and then the VoiceBot server sending that off. And the goal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=589" target="_blank">00:09:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">here is to get sub-second latency. So we have around 200 millisecond latency. We can get that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=595" target="_blank">00:09:55.440</a></span> | <span class="t">down a lot lower if you host yourself. So that's actually what Vapi does. They host their own</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=600" target="_blank">00:10:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">GPUs running our software. And you can crank up the unit economics. You can say, "Hey, you know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=606" target="_blank">00:10:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">what? Instead of doing it at this rate, I want to do it at 5x." So you can get that 200 milliseconds</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=611" target="_blank">00:10:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">down to about 50 milliseconds at the cost of extra GPU compute. And then GPD 3.5 Turbo or 4,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=619" target="_blank">00:10:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">you probably get 400, maybe 600 milliseconds of latency in their hosted API. If you go into Azure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=626" target="_blank">00:10:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and you use their services, you can get that down a lot lower. And then on the text-to-speech side,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=630" target="_blank">00:10:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to show you using DeepGround's text-to-speech. There's a lot of other text-to-speech</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=635" target="_blank">00:10:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">providers out there. And what we try to do is have low latency, human-like at a really good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=641" target="_blank">00:10:41.280</a></span> | <span class="t">price point. And you can get extremely human-like at about 40x price. But that's just something to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=648" target="_blank">00:10:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">keep in mind. All right. Demo time. We have two tabs open here. Okay. So hopefully, this audio</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=657" target="_blank">00:10:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">will play. Good evening. How can DeepGround or text-to-speech meet the specific needs of your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=663" target="_blank">00:11:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">projects?

It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=673" target="_blank">00:11:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">going to be loud. We can't control it. I think I may have blown the speakers. Did you blow the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=680" target="_blank">00:11:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">speakers? Try to tell us something. Yeah. I can use just the laptop. Yeah. Okay. Let me do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=688" target="_blank">00:11:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So turn off the... Yeah. All right. Okay. Let's see if it works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=696" target="_blank">00:11:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Good evening.

I want to talk about something else today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=706" target="_blank">00:11:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm actually at an AWS hacker space for a meetup with personal AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=710" target="_blank">00:11:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Sounds like a cool meetup.

Yeah. Could you give me something funny to show in my demo? Absolutely. How about a joke</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=724" target="_blank">00:12:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">or a lighthearted anecdote to break the ice during your demo? Laughter always helps. Yeah. That'd be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=730" target="_blank">00:12:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">great. How about this one? Why did the computer go to the doctor? Wait, wait. Hang on there a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=736" target="_blank">00:12:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">second. A virus.

Because it had a virus. Smile. Feel free to share that with your audience for a good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=746" target="_blank">00:12:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">chuckle. Take your time. Yeah. So you can see there, it's pretty low latency. Oh, sorry. It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=751" target="_blank">00:12:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">pretty low latency. And if you want to get the source code, it's all open source. So you can just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=761" target="_blank">00:12:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">grab the whole repo. You can build your own voice bot. And if you want to hook it up to a telephony</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=766" target="_blank">00:12:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">system, we have that all available in sample code as well. So you can hook it up to a Twilio,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=772" target="_blank">00:12:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">buy a number, do those sorts of things. So let's just jump back into the presentation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=777" target="_blank">00:12:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, yeah. So the different components. So the speech to text, that's going to be super low</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=787" target="_blank">00:13:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">latency. If you don't get that accurate, you're going to get the wrong answer from the LLM.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=792" target="_blank">00:13:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is the code that you can use. So we have SDKs, Python, Go, Ruby, .NET. And you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=800" target="_blank">00:13:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">essentially use all of those. This is actually a Node.js SDK. And it's very simple to set up,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=806" target="_blank">00:13:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">right? You literally just import it, drop in your API key, and you can listen to those events. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=812" target="_blank">00:13:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">we'll give you back all the text that was actually spoken while it's being spoken. And you just need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=818" target="_blank">00:13:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">to send us the raw audio packets. And then on the GPD side, so you can swap this out with Cloud.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=826" target="_blank">00:13:46.560</a></span> | <span class="t">We actually have a fork of that repo that uses Cloud as well. Cloud haiku is surprisingly good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=832" target="_blank">00:13:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So if cost is something we want to get down, that's definitely an option. But some of our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=838" target="_blank">00:13:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">customers will actually run their own LLAMA2 model super close to the GPUs that are running</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=846" target="_blank">00:14:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the speech to text and text to speech. And that just removes all the network latency out of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=850" target="_blank">00:14:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">equation. So here's a simple example of how you would consume that. I'm sure you're all pretty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=856" target="_blank">00:14:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">familiar with the OpenAI API. And that will basically give you streaming. That's one of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=861" target="_blank">00:14:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">the really important things here is you want time to first token as low as possible. The reason for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=867" target="_blank">00:14:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">that is if you wait till the last token, you're going to increase that latency. And then on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=872" target="_blank">00:14:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">last bit, this is the text to speech part. It's a little more tricky. You've got to deal with audio</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=879" target="_blank">00:14:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">streams. And you're going to want to stream the audio as soon as you get it so that you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=884" target="_blank">00:14:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">actually start playing at the moment the first byte is ready. Again, with the LLM, if you wait</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=890" target="_blank">00:14:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">for the last token, if you wait for the last byte of your audio stream, you're going to incur that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=895" target="_blank">00:14:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">bandwidth delay. So yeah, if anybody wants the open source repo, go ahead and scan that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=902" target="_blank">00:15:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, that's a really cool demo. The latency is great. What do you think the next frontiers are?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=911" target="_blank">00:15:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">You had interruptions, right? What about can it proactively interrupt you based on maybe it knows</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=919" target="_blank">00:15:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">what you're trying to say, like a human would just cut you off, or back channeling or overlapping</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=925" target="_blank">00:15:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">speech and all the more getting more towards human level kind of dialing? Yeah, so the question was,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=930" target="_blank">00:15:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">could the AI interrupt the person? And that's definitely possible. I don't think that would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=937" target="_blank">00:15:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">happen necessarily at the AI model level. I think that would just be business logic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=941" target="_blank">00:15:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you'll get everything that's spoken as it's spoken. So if you were like, you know what,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=947" target="_blank">00:15:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I think I know what you're going to say, you could preemptively do it. And I have seen some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=952" target="_blank">00:15:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">demos where that's a trick that they use to actually lower the latency is to predict what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=957" target="_blank">00:15:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">you're about to say. So then you can fire off an early call to the LLM. This guy's no fun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=964" target="_blank">00:16:04.640</a></span> | <span class="t">You have to send a demo, open repo, and everything. They interrupt, they can have that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=968" target="_blank">00:16:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Very good. Yeah. And the cost of a lot of these LLM things is a big challenge as well. So if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=978" target="_blank">00:16:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you're constantly sending it to an LLM to achieve these use cases, your cost per minute might go up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=986" target="_blank">00:16:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">to like 30 cents. So in this demo here, and these are all kind of list prices, you can get these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=992" target="_blank">00:16:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">prices down with volume. And so if you just signed up today, these are the sorts of prices that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=999" target="_blank">00:16:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">would pay. And just to give you an idea, Cupidy 3.5 Turbo has dropped in price dramatically over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1007" target="_blank">00:16:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">time. And so Claude Haiku is even a fraction of this as well. And then on the text-to-speech side,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1014" target="_blank">00:16:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">doing something like this within 11 labs would be about maybe $1.20, just to give you an idea</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1020" target="_blank">00:17:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">of comparison. So you can do a five-minute call here for about six and a half cents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1025" target="_blank">00:17:05.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you're doing millions of hours of calls, that price can definitely come down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1029" target="_blank">00:17:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So changing that then to be a real-time callable voice bot, like you saw with the VAPI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1037" target="_blank">00:17:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">demo, you're essentially just swapping out the browser for this telephony service, right? So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1043" target="_blank">00:17:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Twilio has about 100 millisecond latency to give you the audio when you get called. And then you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1049" target="_blank">00:17:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">just sending it through that same system and then just back to the telephony provider.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1054" target="_blank">00:17:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And yeah, so if you sign up today, you get $200 in free credits. For post-call transcription,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1061" target="_blank">00:17:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that's about 750 hours. For real-time, that's probably about 500 hours of real-time transcription.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1069" target="_blank">00:17:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's a pretty big freebie there, so if anybody wants it. And that's it. Any questions?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1078" target="_blank">00:17:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, go ahead. Just in terms of achieving real-time performance,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1081" target="_blank">00:18:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">GPD 3.5 versus 4, how do you- Yeah, 4 is going to be a lot slower, especially if you're using</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1088" target="_blank">00:18:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">their hosted API endpoint. You're going to see massive second fluctuations in their hosted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1094" target="_blank">00:18:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">endpoint. If you go on to Azure and you use their service, you're paying more, but you're getting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1101" target="_blank">00:18:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">much better latency. So you could deploy all of this on Azure next to GPD 4, and that's going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1109" target="_blank">00:18:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">give you the sort of latency that you saw in the VAPI demo. The demo I guess actually is using all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1115" target="_blank">00:18:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">hosted APIs, so there's no on-prem kind of setup there. Ethan, Nick, and then I think Harrison</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1125" target="_blank">00:18:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">just walked in. So I'll just warm you guys up a bit. Thanks to David. David only signed up to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1133" target="_blank">00:18:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">speak today, which is a very classic meetup strategy. So we don't have a screen for this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1142" target="_blank">00:19:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Do we have a screen? You can share your screen. I can share my screen. All right, so I'm afraid</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1147" target="_blank">00:19:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">the audio might be shattering your eardrums, so I might have to cut it off, but we can try.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1153" target="_blank">00:19:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">You said it was okay at the start. Yeah, I mean, okay. You can do that on the laptop,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1159" target="_blank">00:19:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">no? No, no, there's no laptop. Yeah, sorry. So maybe from the start, what did you work on,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1165" target="_blank">00:19:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">why? Yeah, sure. So I think actually it feels good to be here because I feel like I'm with my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1169" target="_blank">00:19:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">people. You pretty much summed up the philosophy. What can AI do for you if it has your whole life</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1176" target="_blank">00:19:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">in this context and it experiences your life as you do? Wouldn't it be way better? I understand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1182" target="_blank">00:19:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">you as all your contacts. So that's kind of, I think a lot of us here have the same idea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1190" target="_blank">00:19:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's what I've been working on for, it's about November when Lava came out. So first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1196" target="_blank">00:19:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">started working on the visual component. It's not just audio. You want it to see what you see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1201" target="_blank">00:20:01.520</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's a lot more challenging to get a form factor with continual video capture. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1209" target="_blank">00:20:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">built a really, really small but simple device that's actually easy to use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1215" target="_blank">00:20:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know. I mean, you guys can check it out after the talk. But I think there's a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1225" target="_blank">00:20:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">of advantages to not having to have an extra piece of hardware to carry around, but at least</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1229" target="_blank">00:20:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">we try and make it as small and as light as possible. You don't have to charge it every</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1232" target="_blank">00:20:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">couple of days. But there's also other subtle reasons why it's good to have an external piece</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1238" target="_blank">00:20:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">of hardware, which I can show you in a minute. So yeah, this captures all the time. And in fact,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1245" target="_blank">00:20:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I can show you here in the app. So you can see this default. It's got the battery level here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1255" target="_blank">00:20:55.440</a></span> | <span class="t">But here you can see all the conversations I've had. And this is actually an ongoing conversation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1262" target="_blank">00:21:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can see where I am and transcript in real time. We do a bunch of different pipelines. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1273" target="_blank">00:21:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">after the conversation is over, we'll run it through a larger model. And then do the speaker</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1280" target="_blank">00:21:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">verification so it knows it's me, which is important so it can understand what I'm saying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1284" target="_blank">00:21:24.720</a></span> | <span class="t">versus other people in the room. Actually, conversation end pointing, and the VPN person</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1290" target="_blank">00:21:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">probably knows, even just utterance level end pointing is complicated at heart. When am I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1295" target="_blank">00:21:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">stopping talking? Or am I going to keep talking and just pause for a second? That's hard. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1300" target="_blank">00:21:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">then conversation end pointing, when is this a distinct conversation versus another, is even</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1305" target="_blank">00:21:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">harder. But that's important because you don't want just one block of dialogue for your whole</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1310" target="_blank">00:21:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">day. It's much more useful if you can segment it into distinct semantic conversations. So that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1316" target="_blank">00:21:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">involves not only voice activity detection, but things like signals around your location,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1323" target="_blank">00:22:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and even the topics that you were talking about, like at the LLM level. So it's very difficult.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1328" target="_blank">00:22:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's still a lot of work to do, but it does work. So in the end result, I will get a summary</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1334" target="_blank">00:22:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">generated, some takeaways, a summary of the atmosphere. Then from the major</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1346" target="_blank">00:22:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">topics, I'll find some links, and then you still have the raw data. So that's the foundation layer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1353" target="_blank">00:22:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">is to have something that does the continuous capture, does the basic level of processing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1359" target="_blank">00:22:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">but that's just the base layer. I can query against the whole context of everything it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1369" target="_blank">00:22:49.360</a></span> | <span class="t">knows about me. I think this is, I was talking to my developer a few days ago. So here we have,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1387" target="_blank">00:23:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, it's through retrieval on all my conversations. This is a conversation I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1393" target="_blank">00:23:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">last talking about, and it will even cite the source. So I can just jump to the actual</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1398" target="_blank">00:23:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">conversation just a few days ago, or a week ago, or something. And so here we were debugging some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1402" target="_blank">00:23:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">web view issues. So that's just kind of like the basic memory recall use case. I just have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1410" target="_blank">00:23:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe one or two more, then I'll turn it back over. So again, that's all kind of the base layer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1417" target="_blank">00:23:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">but like the real, you know, I think everybody here believes that the real future will be using</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1421" target="_blank">00:23:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">all of this context so that AI can be more proactive, can be more autonomous, because it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1428" target="_blank">00:23:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">doesn't need to come to ask you everything.

But we have some really kind of novel ideas about it. The,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1740" target="_blank">00:29:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">it's Bluetooth Low Energy, which, I mean, I'm sure you've seen other ones that operate that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1750" target="_blank">00:29:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">way, and that has a lot of advantages. We also have one that's LTE, and so there's, like, LTE-M</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1756" target="_blank">00:29:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">is, like, a low-power subset of LTE.

Just a quick question. I saw the part of the interface where it had a,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1778" target="_blank">00:29:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">was that a streaming from iPhone?

I think the ultimate goal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=1796" target="_blank">00:29:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">is that that disappears entirely, right?

So, he started that. I think he was, like, one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2007" target="_blank">00:33:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">of the first people who started, like, open sourcing any kind of wearables. Probably Adam</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2012" target="_blank">00:33:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">actually was before, but you announced first, so I remember that. But, yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2018" target="_blank">00:33:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Anyways, so, yeah, this is his repo. You can, like, check it out. I think I have a QR code</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2023" target="_blank">00:33:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">here opened as well.

Should be, yeah, just scan this QR code, and you can just access his repository.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2035" target="_blank">00:33:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so, this is Ethan's. Then there is another one, which, in my opinion, well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2042" target="_blank">00:34:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">it's definitely the biggest one. It's by the guy who's sitting right there, Adam. I truly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2048" target="_blank">00:34:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">believe that Adam is, like, the guy who started all open source hardware movement, so at least</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2053" target="_blank">00:34:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I started doing everything because of Adam, so thank you for that. And they have a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2058" target="_blank">00:34:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">of traction here, 2,600 stars, and if you want to kind of, like, ramp up your way into open source,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2066" target="_blank">00:34:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">like, wearables of any kind, I suggest to start with this repository. It's probably the biggest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2071" target="_blank">00:34:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">one you'll be able to find right now, and the QR code, you can scan, I think, this one. Yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2077" target="_blank">00:34:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">just, like, feel free to scan. I'll send it. Yeah, yeah, cool, cool, cool, cool, awesome.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2081" target="_blank">00:34:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, they use, I think, Raspberry Pi, also ESP32, which is kind of technical. You probably don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2088" target="_blank">00:34:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">need this information, but anyways. Yeah, and now, who I am, like, a little bit about myself as well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2095" target="_blank">00:34:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">some marketing. So, my story starts very recently, maybe two months ago, after I saw Ethan's and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2101" target="_blank">00:35:01.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Adam's launch of, like, their open source hardware stuff, and I launched my own. It all started with,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2107" target="_blank">00:35:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">basically, Seasoned Disease from Humane, and we launched, like, just for fun, honestly, Pumain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2115" target="_blank">00:35:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">The idea here was, like, you take a picture, and you scan the person's face, and we searched the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2121" target="_blank">00:35:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">entire internet, and we find the person's profile, like, and send it to you, while, like, either,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2126" target="_blank">00:35:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">like, via notification, or on the site, and so on. So, this is how it looks. Started with that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2131" target="_blank">00:35:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">had a lot of contributors, was a fun project, but not really, I mean, like, yeah, we don't really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2136" target="_blank">00:35:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">want to bring any harm to Pumain, and so on and so forth, just fun stuff. So, after that, we did,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2143" target="_blank">00:35:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">oh, QR for this, I think we will also send, right? Like, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool. Okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2149" target="_blank">00:35:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">another one I will promote here a little bit is this one. This, we launched, literally, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2154" target="_blank">00:35:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">last week. This is pretty much what Adam and Ethan have done, with the only difference that we use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2161" target="_blank">00:36:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">right now, the lowest power chip. I think Ethan also uses that. I just try to, like, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2166" target="_blank">00:36:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">like, as soon as possible, to let everyone know that, like, I think it's probably the best</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2171" target="_blank">00:36:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">opportunity you can currently find in the market. It's called Friend, you can check it out. This is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2175" target="_blank">00:36:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">how it looks. I actually have it with me. And I was supposed to actually show you, like, the live</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2182" target="_blank">00:36:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">demo as well, but we just did a very cool update, where we made it work with Android, by the way,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2190" target="_blank">00:36:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">so it's iOS and Android right now. And also, we updated the quality of speech, literally,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2197" target="_blank">00:36:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">three hours ago, and made it, like, five times better. So, when we launched, I'll be honest,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2201" target="_blank">00:36:41.280</a></span> | <span class="t">it was, like, completely horrible, and now it's, like, five times better. It's amazing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2205" target="_blank">00:36:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and I'm really excited by that. I would want to show you the video, but I know that it's, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2210" target="_blank">00:36:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you will not want to have your ears, you know, like... Oh, yeah, really? Oh, nice. Okay, let's try.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2218" target="_blank">00:36:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Anyways, yeah, this is the chip that is being used inside of that wearable, and it works pretty much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2224" target="_blank">00:37:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the same as what Ethan has with... Oh, it doesn't work, right? Next. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2236" target="_blank">00:37:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">let me figure out which one. Yeah, yeah. You can go back. Okay, let's try. Oh, nice. Okay, cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2246" target="_blank">00:37:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Awesome.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2246" target="_blank">00:37:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Start it. Give me the permissions here, and hit next, and scan for devices here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2255" target="_blank">00:37:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and then select the device, and that should just connect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2261" target="_blank">00:37:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, I think we're going to start speaking. Yeah, so pretty much testing this for the first time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2270" target="_blank">00:37:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and let's see if it's able to transcribe what I'm trying to speak, and yeah, pretty much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2278" target="_blank">00:37:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">waiting for the first 20 days must have finished, and for it to return us the output of the speech</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2289" target="_blank">00:38:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">from the OpenAI Whisper endpoint, and it says... Yeah, there we go. Yeah, so as you have seen,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2301" target="_blank">00:38:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">it recorded the speech on the lowest power chip probably ever right now accessible in the market,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2307" target="_blank">00:38:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and I'm very excited that we actually made it work, because it was very, very fun. It took,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2313" target="_blank">00:38:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">like, a lot of time. Anyways, that's pretty much it, I guess. I don't really have anything else for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2318" target="_blank">00:38:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">you to show. This is the final QR code. I know you'll have all the links, but this one I really,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2324" target="_blank">00:38:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">really advise you to scan, because it has basically the collection of, like, all links in one place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2328" target="_blank">00:38:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So yeah, that's pretty much it. Use open source. I think it's cool,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2334" target="_blank">00:38:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and let's try to build cool stuff together. That's pretty much it. Thank you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2342" target="_blank">00:39:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Any questions? Did you record on that? No, because... You're not recording right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2354" target="_blank">00:39:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">No, no, no. I'm not recording, because we launched the update, like, four hours ago,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2358" target="_blank">00:39:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and I wanted to bring it here, so I broke my thing, and now it's, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2362" target="_blank">00:39:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">half broken, unfortunately. But anyways, any questions? Cool. Yeah, go on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2371" target="_blank">00:39:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">What do you think the biggest next challenge? Biggest next challenge? Yeah, I definitely agree</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2378" target="_blank">00:39:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">with you that the biggest challenge is, like, editing video and images and so on. It's, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2382" target="_blank">00:39:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">very hard as hell, and I think to make software useful as well is very, very hard. Like, yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2388" target="_blank">00:39:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">we can all do, maybe, like, recording from the device and, like, attach maybe some battery and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2392" target="_blank">00:39:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">so on, but, like, how to make it actually, like, sexy, that's hard. Like, how to make it, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2398" target="_blank">00:39:58.560</a></span> | <span class="t">do actions, how to make it remember everything and so on and so forth, that's the biggest challenge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2402" target="_blank">00:40:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So, yeah, but I agree with everything you said. I would have said that the biggest challenge is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2408" target="_blank">00:40:08.560</a></span> | <span class="t">making people want to wear it. Oh, yeah. I don't know the tech bros or girls, or specific, probably.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2415" target="_blank">00:40:15.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, Adam, the guy who created the biggest open source thing, he said that the biggest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2421" target="_blank">00:40:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">challenge is to make people want it, basically, right? I mean, same, yes. So, that's one of his</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2427" target="_blank">00:40:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">suggestions. Yeah, go on. What's been the challenge of reducing latency?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2432" target="_blank">00:40:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">What's been the challenge of reducing latency? Honestly, it was just, like, software issue,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2438" target="_blank">00:40:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">because, like, this chip is, like, not that widely used. There's not so much documentation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2444" target="_blank">00:40:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">not so many projects and so on. So, just, like, a matter of, like, trying other things. And also,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2448" target="_blank">00:40:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">it doesn't have huge on-board memory. So, like, how do you store very good quality memory on a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2454" target="_blank">00:40:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">very small, very quality audio on a small memory chip, and then send it to phones and stream it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2461" target="_blank">00:41:01.040</a></span> | <span class="t">basically, non-stop? That was pretty hard. But we solved it, like, five hours ago,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2465" target="_blank">00:41:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and that's pretty much it. Yeah, go on. How did you improve the quality of voice?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2470" target="_blank">00:41:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">We just made it work. Like, we used, we had 4,000, it's pretty technical, I don't think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2478" target="_blank">00:41:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know if you'll want this, but anyways, we used 4,000 hertz, like, quality. It was, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2483" target="_blank">00:41:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">super bad, because the memory was too small. And now, we just found a way to, like, compress it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2489" target="_blank">00:41:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and improve it to, like, 16,000, which is, like, pretty great, which you have heard on the video.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2495" target="_blank">00:41:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it can, like, recognize pretty much anything, even, like, multiple people speaking, even if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2499" target="_blank">00:41:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">will be there and the device will be here.

I think we can leave the...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2506" target="_blank">00:41:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">The last one.

So, good one will be, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2518" target="_blank">00:41:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, two feet from person to person, like, good. If you have maybe, like, four feet from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2523" target="_blank">00:42:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">each other, it might still be a person. Cool. Thank you all. Cool. So, what I want to talk</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2544" target="_blank">00:42:24.480</a></span> | <span class="t">about is a lot less cool than all this hardware stuff, so I feel a little bit out of place,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2549" target="_blank">00:42:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">but my name is Harrison, a co-founder of BlankChain.

We do absolutely nothing with hardware, so when we're exploring this, we are not building,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2579" target="_blank">00:42:59.120</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of, like, hardware devices, so we took a more, kind of, like, software approach.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2582" target="_blank">00:43:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I think one of the use cases where this type of, like, personalization and memory</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2586" target="_blank">00:43:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">is really important is in, kind of, like, a journaling app. I think, for obvious reasons,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2592" target="_blank">00:43:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">when you journal, you expect it to be, kind of, like, a personal experience where you're,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2595" target="_blank">00:43:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of, like, sharing your goals and learnings, and I think in a scenario like that, it's really,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2601" target="_blank">00:43:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">really important for, if there is an interactive experience for the LLM that you're interacting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2606" target="_blank">00:43:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">with to really remember a lot of what you're talking about. So, this is something we launched,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2612" target="_blank">00:43:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I think, last week, and it's basically a journaling app with some interactive experience,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2618" target="_blank">00:43:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and we're using it as a way to, kind of, like, test out some of the memory functionality that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2621" target="_blank">00:43:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">we're working on. So, I want to give a quick walkthrough of this and then maybe just share</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2626" target="_blank">00:43:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">some high-level thoughts on memory for LLM systems in general. So, the UX for this that we decided</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2633" target="_blank">00:43:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">on was you would open up, kind of, like, a new journal, and then you'd basically write a journal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2638" target="_blank">00:43:58.240</a></span> | <span class="t">entry, and I think this is, kind of, like, a little cheat mode as well, because I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2642" target="_blank">00:44:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">this will encourage people to say more interesting things. So, I think if you're just taking, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2648" target="_blank">00:44:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">a regular chatbot, there's a lot of, like, hey, hi, what's up, things like that, and I don't think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2653" target="_blank">00:44:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that's actually interesting to try to, like, remember things about. I think it's more interesting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2658" target="_blank">00:44:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">if you talk about personal things, and so let me try this out. I'm giving the talk right now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2668" target="_blank">00:44:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and then I can submit this, and then the UX that we have is that a little chat with a companion</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2674" target="_blank">00:44:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">will open up. Okay, so, yeah, so, right before this, I told you that I was about to give a chat</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2679" target="_blank">00:44:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">about a journaling app, and so it, kind of, like, remembered that I was going to do all that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2687" target="_blank">00:44:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Is there a particular part I'm most excited to share? The memory bit. I don't know. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2694" target="_blank">00:44:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">this actually worked on the first try, so I was a bit surprised by that, so that's good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2698" target="_blank">00:44:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And, oh, okay, so, how do you plan to tie in your love for sports with the theme of memory during</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2705" target="_blank">00:45:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">your talk? So, before, when I was talking to it, I had mentioned that one of the things that I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2710" target="_blank">00:45:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">wanted to talk about was, you know, how a journal app should remember that I like sports, so I guess</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2715" target="_blank">00:45:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">it remembered that fact as well. Amazing. So, I can end the session. So, the basic idea there,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2720" target="_blank">00:45:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and again, this is, you know, we're not building this as a real application. We would love to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2725" target="_blank">00:45:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">enable other people who are building applications like this. I think the thing that we're interested</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2730" target="_blank">00:45:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">in is really, like, what does memory look like for applications like this? And I think you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2735" target="_blank">00:45:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">see a little bit of that if you click on this memory tab here. We have, like, a user profile</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2741" target="_blank">00:45:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">where we basically kind of, like, show what we learned about a person over time, and then we also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2746" target="_blank">00:45:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">have a more, like, semantic thing as well. So, I could search in things like Europe,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2751" target="_blank">00:45:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and I'm going to Europe kind of, like, after a wedding. I love Italy. And so, basically,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2757" target="_blank">00:45:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a few different forms of memory. And if you'll allow me two minutes of kind of just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2765" target="_blank">00:46:05.040</a></span> | <span class="t">theorizing about memory, we're doing a hackathon tomorrow, and maybe some of you are going to that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2770" target="_blank">00:46:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of signed up. I don't know if he's actually going to show up. So, very quickly, like, how I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2778" target="_blank">00:46:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">think memory is really, really interesting. It's also kind of, like, really vague at a high level.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2783" target="_blank">00:46:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I think, like, there's some state that you're tracking, and then how do you update that state,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2788" target="_blank">00:46:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and how do you use that state? These are, like, really kind of, like, vague things,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2793" target="_blank">00:46:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and there's a bunch of different forms that it could take. Some examples of kind of, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2798" target="_blank">00:46:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah. Some examples of memory, like, that a bunch of real apps do right now, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2806" target="_blank">00:46:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">conversational memory is a very simple but obvious form of memory. Like, it remembers the previous</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2811" target="_blank">00:46:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">message that you sent. Like, that is, like, incredibly basic, but I would argue that it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2815" target="_blank">00:46:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">can fall into this idea of, like, how is it updated? What's the state? How is it combined?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2819" target="_blank">00:46:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Semantic memory is another kind of similar one, where it's a pretty simple idea. You take all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2824" target="_blank">00:47:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">memory bits, you throw them into a vector store, and then you fetch the most relevant ones. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2828" target="_blank">00:47:08.560</a></span> | <span class="t">then I think one of the early types of memory that we had in LingChain was this knowledge graph</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2833" target="_blank">00:47:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">memory, where you kind of, like, construct a knowledge graph over time, which is maybe,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2836" target="_blank">00:47:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">like, overly complex for some kind of, like, use cases, but really interesting to think about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2839" target="_blank">00:47:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So, LingMem, like, name TBD, is some of the memory things that we're working on, and we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2848" target="_blank">00:47:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of wanted to constrain how we're thinking about memory to make it more tractable. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2853" target="_blank">00:47:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">we're focusing on, like, chat experiences and chat data. We're primarily focused on, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2858" target="_blank">00:47:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">one human to one AI conversations, and we thought that flexibility in defining, like, memory schemas</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2864" target="_blank">00:47:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and instructions was really important. Like, one of the things we noticed when talking to a bunch</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2867" target="_blank">00:47:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">of people was, like, the exact memory that their bot cared about was different based on their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2872" target="_blank">00:47:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">application. If they were building, like, a SQL bot, that type of memory would be very different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2876" target="_blank">00:47:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">from the journaling app, for example. So, there's a few different, like, memory types that we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2881" target="_blank">00:48:01.440</a></span> | <span class="t">thinking about. All of these are very, like, early on. I think one interesting one is, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2886" target="_blank">00:48:06.240</a></span> | <span class="t">a thread-level memory. An example of this would just be, like, a summary of a conversation. You</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2890" target="_blank">00:48:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">could then use this. You could extract, like, follow-up items, and then in the journaling</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2894" target="_blank">00:48:14.720</a></span> | <span class="t">app, you could kind of, like, follow up with that in the next conversation. We actually might have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2898" target="_blank">00:48:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">added that. That might be why it's so good at remembering what I talked about in the previous</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2901" target="_blank">00:48:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">talk. I forget. Another one is this concept of a user profile. It's basically some JSON schema</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2907" target="_blank">00:48:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that you can kind of, like, update over time.

So, an example could be,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71RsJADQ3oM&t=2924" target="_blank">00:48:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">like, restaurants that I've mentioned.
