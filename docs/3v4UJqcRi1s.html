So how do the promises</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=43" target="_blank">00:00:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">of Scripture unfold and how does Christ fulfill the biblical promises in the Passover?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=48" target="_blank">00:00:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I asked Dr. Carson to explain.

And of course, that's not true.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=64" target="_blank">00:01:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's some promises made to people other than me. And so one must read promises in their context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=73" target="_blank">00:01:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">But there are many promises that God gives to human beings, generically, all human beings,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=78" target="_blank">00:01:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and other promises that he gives only to his own blood-bought covenant people. And some promises</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=86" target="_blank">00:01:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that he gives to Israel, and some promises that he gives to individuals, to the Davidic dynasty,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">for example. But one of the things that's pretty obvious whenever you start tracking out the theme</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">of promise is that it is tied to a lot of things. Now, earlier on in this series, I said that one of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the things that's remarkable about biblical theology is that although one way of doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=108" target="_blank">00:01:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">biblical theology is to track out particular themes across Scripture - temple, and creation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and sin, and priesthood, and promise, and sacrifice, and so on, and so on, and so on - what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you discover pretty quickly is that they get intertwined. And so that it becomes harder and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">harder to talk about one without talking about others. So for the sake of convenience, for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">sake of learning, we might talk about one at a time. But pretty soon it's inevitable that we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=138" target="_blank">00:02:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">talking about several things at once. And nowhere is that more true than in the theme of promise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a sense in which we can talk about promise and outline what the Bible says in this regard in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.040</a></span> | <span class="t">five minutes, but one could take 20 hours and still not exhaust the theme at all. So in particular,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">promise is often tied to Messiah. It's very often tied to notions of covenant. It's tied to notions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.920</a></span> | <span class="t">of the Holy Spirit. It's tied to notions of typology, and many other things. And I'll briefly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">sidle up to several of those things on the way by today, but the focus is on promise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.520</a></span> | <span class="t">The opening round of explicit promise is really in Genesis 3.

I don't know how many saw the Mel Gibson film on the crucifixion,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the passion narrative, but there's an opening scene there that is really quite dramatic. At one level,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.360</a></span> | <span class="t">it's not historical at all, but in visual display, it's got it exactly right. There's Jesus praying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">in the garden, drops of bloody sweat coming from him in an agony as he contemplates the cross</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and asks his Father, "If it be possible, take this cup from me." And a snake begins to crawl over him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And then slowly, Jesus stands up and then, "Stop!" He crushes the serpent with his heel. I remember</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">seeing that in the theater and thinking, "I wonder how many people in this theater know what text</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that's alluding to?" So at the very moment that Christ is crushing the head of the serpent with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">his heel, yet at the same time, there is one sense, at one level, Satan is striking out to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">kill Christ himself.

Well, more promises. In the last session, we looked at covenants, and in particular,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the Abrahamic covenant.

And I think that it's an important element</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=1108" target="_blank">00:18:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">in the very structure of Old Testament biblical prophecy.

But the mountain example helped me a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=1117" target="_blank">00:18:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">great deal to recognize what was going on in some of these passages. So Isaiah 65-66 anticipates a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=1125" target="_blank">00:18:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">new heaven and a new earth, but it's in a context where there are also more immediate prophecies</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=1129" target="_blank">00:18:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that are also being fulfilled. But ultimately, they are all picked up. And even "new heaven and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=1135" target="_blank">00:18:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">new earth" language is picked up by 2 Peter, for example. And it's picked up finally in the book</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=1143" target="_blank">00:19:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">of Revelation 21 and 22. There's one more element of promise that I should mention. This one is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=1150" target="_blank">00:19:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">little more disputed, but in my view, it's pretty important. In Matthew 5, verses 17-20, which is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=1158" target="_blank">00:19:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">paragraph that introduces the so-called antitheses of Matthew 5, "You have heard that it was said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=1164" target="_blank">00:19:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">but I say unto you, you have heard that it was said, but I say unto you." To introduce all of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=1168" target="_blank">00:19:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">those antitheses, Jesus says in Matthew 5, 17 and following, "Do not think that I have come to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=1174" target="_blank">00:19:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">destroy the law. I have not come to destroy it, but to fulfill it." Now, it's possible, just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=1181" target="_blank">00:19:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">barely, to understand "fulfill" there to mean something like "to keep it." But there are lots</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=1186" target="_blank">00:19:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">of good verbs to use in Greek, as in English, to mean "to keep." "Fulfill" in Matthew, the verb</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=1193" target="_blank">00:19:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">plaid "ao" - "to fulfill" - is very common. It's used more in Matthew than in any other New</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=1199" target="_blank">00:19:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Testament book. And without exception in the other usages in Matthew, the verb "to fulfill" really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=1205" target="_blank">00:20:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">means "to fulfill that which was promised." So I'm persuaded that Jesus is not saying something like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=1211" target="_blank">00:20:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">"I have not come to abolish the law, but to keep it." And he's not saying something like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=1216" target="_blank">00:20:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">"I have not come to abolish the law, but to show you its deeper meaning." That's not quite right,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=1222" target="_blank">00:20:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">either. But, "I have not come to abolish the law, but to fulfill it." That is, to show all the ways</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=1231" target="_blank">00:20:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">in which it points forward. And, of course, we're familiar with that already in things like the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=1236" target="_blank">00:20:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Passover law. The Passover law is part of law, and it points forward to the ultimate Passover.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=1241" target="_blank">00:20:41.280</a></span> | <span class="t">The sacrifices of Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, point forward ultimately to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=1246" target="_blank">00:20:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">ultimate sacrifice. So, in that sense, we're already familiar with the notion that law points forward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=1252" target="_blank">00:20:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">But in the Antipathies, we're dealing with categories that transcend the sacrificial system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=1258" target="_blank">00:20:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that what Jesus is saying is that even what we commonly call the moral law of God,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=1265" target="_blank">00:21:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">given in the Old Covenant Scriptures, itself points forward to the very perfection that is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=1272" target="_blank">00:21:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">finally characteristic of the new heaven and the new earth.

But already, Jesus says, "You have heard that it was said, but I'm telling you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=1290" target="_blank">00:21:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">this is the way you live now." And what He's demanding is absolute perfection. That's the way</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=1296" target="_blank">00:21:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Matthew 5 ends. "Be perfect, even as your heavenly Father is perfect." Because the law ultimately</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=1302" target="_blank">00:21:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">points forward to the utter perfection that the people of God must have before God, which is met</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v4UJqcRi1s&t=1311" target="_blank">00:21:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">finally by Christ's sacrifice.
