I think too many of us quit before giving our effort a chance to produce amazing results, and that's really a shame.</p><p>Imagine working for two, three, four years, and then you decide, "You know what? Ah, forget it. This is never going to get anywhere." But if you had stuck it out for the fifth year, then maybe you would have caught your lucky break or seen some type of tremendous amount of improvement.</p><p>So I think 10 years is the magical number, and it just doesn't come out of thin air. It comes from four years of high school, four years of college, and then finally three years of going to business school part-time for me to finally feel comfortable having a solid grasp on everything finance.</p><p>Ten years comes from my experience working at one firm from 2001 to 2012. After 10 years, I realized a lot of good things can happen to one's career and to one's net worth. There's definitely a lot of network effects there. Ten years comes from investing in the stock market and real estate market.</p><p>Unless you're extremely, extremely lucky, chances are high that you will earn a nice return on your investments in any 10-year period. Ten years also comes from my adventures in battling it out in USTA tennis. I was able to get to a 5.0 level at age 39 after starting at a 4.0 level at age 29.</p><p>So generally, after you turn 30, your level plateaus or generally goes down. But after hundreds of hours of practice, it's possible to get better. And then finally, 10 years comes from publishing three times a week on average between July 2009 to July 2019 on Financial Samurai. So this is basically a 10-year anniversary celebration podcast and post that I've written.</p><p>But I really don't want to celebrate me so much. I want to think about ways in which you can reach a 10-year milestone in whatever it is you want to do so you can achieve your goals. So to start, I think you don't have to be special. Stop thinking you need to be smart or good-looking or tall or rich or connected to succeed at your goals because it's simply not true.</p><p>Regular people get ahead all the time. I came to America at 14 years old where only 5.5% of the population looked like me. I had no mentors or connections. I had to start all over and find new friends. It was really hard at first because all of my classmates were all friends since elementary school.</p><p>So I was that misfit who constantly got in trouble. I ate lunch at the library with other misfits and we got suspended, we got into fights, we snuck off campus to do random things. We were troublemakers. And growing up I lacked the ability to think quickly on my feet because I found my thoughts constantly getting garbled and juggling around between Mandarin and English.</p><p>It would have been nice. It would have been nice to get my English language fundamentals down as a kid but that's just the way it was. My grades and SAT scores were nothing to write a home about and as a result I went to a public university after attending a public high school.</p><p>And the only reason why I got into a major investment bank, and it was a really tough one, it was a tough one to get into Goldman Sachs, it was private at the time and I think the acceptance rate was like 2% or something. The only reason why I got in was because I got on a 6am bus on a Saturday morning.</p><p>The career fair was two hours away in Washington DC. Thirty people signed up to attend and I was the only one to show up. So the guy, the driver, went to his headquarters and then switched the bus for a limousine, Lincoln Town Car and then we drove up together.</p><p>That was my first experience having a private chauffeur. So seven months, six rounds and 55 interviews later I finally got that job. I was thinking to myself, really there's nothing special about me. Not my looks, not my intelligence, not my physique, not my wit, not my writing, not my voice, not my personality.</p><p>The only thing I did was keep on going and I kept on going until I left work in 2012 to focus on financial samurai. So I really believe grit is by far the most important attribute to achieving your goals. Don't think you need to have special skills to get ahead.</p><p>Who you are is good enough already. And if you last, if you last for 10 years, if you last for at least 5 years, you're going to eventually catch your lucky break. It's impossible, I think it's practically impossible to dedicate so much of your time to your craft and not get noticed by somebody.</p><p>Success is a numbers game. The more you put yourself out there, the more successful you will be. If your success rate is 1%, you've got to ask 100 people to go out on a date with you before you can get just one yes. My lucky break came in 2010 when the LA Times profiled financial samurai because I wrote an article about umbrella policy, the importance of an umbrella policy if you have teenagers.</p><p>That was totally all random lucky break. But once financial samurai got featured in a legitimate paper, other journalists started reaching out. Another thing you need to do is cherish the criticism. If you're getting criticized, know that what you're doing is making a difference. People who don't care, don't criticize.</p><p>They couldn't give two craps about what you're doing. Listen to what your critics are saying and make any necessary changes. If you have a chance, go watch Randy Pausch's YouTube video called The Last Lecture. It is so powerful, it is so important, and it's so relevant today than ever before.</p><p>It's one of the best videos you could ever watch. For some reason, I get pumped anytime someone throws a nasty gram at me or says something bad. I don't know why. I just love criticism. It's like getting a dose of Popeye's spinach that motivates me to keep on going.</p><p>One time I got mobbed on Twitter for saying I was a high school tennis coach, which I was and I still am, and I make $1,100 a month, which is the truth. And I was just looking for educators to interview to highlight their story and how they can make it in an expensive city.</p><p>So instead of getting high-fived or rewarded, "Hey, good job trying to highlight other people in other professions who might not make as much," I was mobbed. So instead, I was like, "You know what? I'm going to write a new post about raising a family in pricey San Francisco on a tennis coach's salary." And of course, there was a twist to it, and the post ended up getting picked up by Business Insider and a couple other outlets, and it ended up doing very, very well.</p><p>So if you can cherish that criticism, it'll help you improve on your weaknesses and shine a spotlight on all your blind spots. Use criticism to get better and prove your critics wrong. A next tip, be a super optimist. When an ambulance wails by, do you feel sad or happy?</p><p>I used to feel very sad knowing that someone was suffering until a friend changed my perspective. She said, "Instead of feeling sad, Sam, feel happy that help is on the way." And as soon as I heard that, I thought, "Damn right, that's awesome. That is awesome that someone is going to go and help that person." You must believe in your mission, because if you don't, nobody else will.</p><p>Do your best to see the positives in every single situation. I oftentimes, well, not often anymore, but I used to sprain my ankle like once every six months to a year. And every time I would sprain my ankle, I'd think, "Damn, thank goodness I did not break my ankle." So find the positives in every single situation.</p><p>Next, make sure you focus on what matters most. It is really, really easy to get distracted nowadays thanks to social media, TV, all these other random shiny objects. You must ruthlessly focus on just doing one or two things at a time. For me, that was publishing without fail three times a week on average for 10 years in a row.</p><p>I can get easily distracted by lots of other things, but I knew if I would just publish, everything was going to be all right. So it's kind of like paying yourself first. Pay yourself first, whatever it's 20%, 30%, 50% of your income after tax, and then go free, go hog wild and spend the rest of your money, because you know you've already taken care of the most important thing.</p><p>The next item on the list is reduce your time on social media. Social media is a real time sick where nothing really productive gets done. You know it, be honest with yourself. Some people even ruin their lives or their careers based on what they've said online. Try to limit your time on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, et cetera, to 30 minutes a day or less.</p><p>Maybe not at all. If you've read the book Skin in the Game by Nassim Taleb, there's a great quote that says, "You don't want to win an argument. You want to win." Think about that for a little bit. There are all these wars on Twitter where people try to convince the other side that they're wrong and they're right, and it just goes on and on, and it's just endless.</p><p>What you want to do instead of spending your time trying to convince other people that your way is the right way, you need to just spend time living your life exactly the way you want. Focus on your offline relationships way more, 10 times more, 100 times more than your online relationships.</p><p>They are just so much more important. Next, give as much as you can without asking for anything in return. This is really important. The more you give, the more you will get. I truly believe this. Too many people ask first and then maybe give something. Even more people just take, take, take.</p><p>It's unbelievable. Find ways to endlessly help someone in your field that you admire, and I promise you, he or she will take notice and eventually help you out. You've got to learn to ask, and the best way to learn to ask is to say, "Hey, may I help you in any way?</p><p>I've noticed you've done this, this, and that. I would love to help you get better in this, this, and that." That is the right way to ask. Don't say, "Hey, can I pick your brain? I need to know this, this, this and get help on this, this, this, and that." You've got to respect the other person's time.</p><p>You've got to develop that relationship and make them care about you. It can't just be a cold ask without any kind of buildup. So spend time learning how to ask properly. Next, realize some people will hate you no matter what. This is really important. You cannot expect to be universally loved.</p><p>Therefore, do not try to please everyone. If you try to please everyone, you're just going to disappoint yourself and other people because you're going to sound like a fake. Instead, be true to your own principles. People who share your principles will eventually gravitate towards you. Every week, someone tells me over social media, in the comments, or over email how bad of a writer I am.</p><p>If they don't denigrate my writing, someone will say something negative about my race, my sex, that I live in San Francisco, my attitude towards whatever. But I keep on going because of my promise to last 10 years. And to be frank, I do get a thrill out of negativity because it just pumps me up like I said.</p><p>And now that I have a podcast, people have left reviews saying that I have a terrible voice, have too many pauses, say "like" and "um" way too many times, I'm out of touch, yada yada yada. But I keep on going because the only way I can improve is if I continue to practice my delivery.</p><p>Years from now, I'm sure my podcast will be better. Besides, I'm determined to build an audio library for my children in case I die before they become adults. I've already come to accept the fact that some people will always hate me for who I am. And so should you.</p><p>Just accept that people will find something about you that they won't really like. It's not your problem that they don't like you, it's theirs. No matter what happens, you'll feel great knowing that you're living a life true to your principles. Next, don't take yourself too seriously, silly goose. Learn to laugh at yourself, especially during impossible, impossible situations.</p><p>You'll loosen up and be less offended by random things. Boy, it sure seems like folks are getting really offended very easily nowadays. And can you imagine always getting just bothered by whatever you hear and see? You can't even relax and concentrate. You probably develop a tremendous amount of anxiety.</p><p>That's not really helpful or conducive to you reaching your 10 year milestone. Learn how to make other people laugh as well. They'll appreciate you more for making them feel good. It'll create this connection, a positive connection, about who you are and that joy that you bring to them. Next, change your inertia.</p><p>You can always find ways to minimize or solve your pain points to help you focus. One of my worries is publishing a post full of errors. Oftentimes, no matter how hard and how often I review a post, I cannot catch all the errors. So as a result, I enlisted my father to help me edit most of my posts for the past several years and he's helped a lot and I've also changed the way I've sent out my RSS email blasts.</p><p>In the past, the email blast would just get sent out with the entire post. And then I'd cringe when I saw the errors I did not catch beforehand. So now, the email RSS blast is more like a snippet. And the snippet, if there's error, it's okay. But it leads the reader to the post on my website and from there, if I see something, I can just quickly edit it and it'll feel like nothing ever happened.</p><p>So if you have nagging problems, stop letting inertia force you to do things the way they've always been done before. Take some time to take a step back to see if you can do things differently because I'm sure you can. Next, good enough is good enough. Stop feeling like you need to be perfect in order to launch.</p><p>There's no such thing as perfect. People don't expect perfect from you. You shouldn't expect perfection from yourself. The largest, richest, most resourceful tech companies in the world are not perfect. If they were, they wouldn't push out app updates every week, maybe every other day to fix bugs you had no idea existed.</p><p>Go look in your app store right now and see how many updates there are. It's crazy. If you can get 70% to 80% of the way there, I say press the button. Ship it. Once live, continuously work to make your product better. Next, find your competitive advantage. If you have a competitive advantage, you can last far longer than those who don't.</p><p>Be honest about your strengths and your weaknesses. My weaknesses, I probably don't follow instructions very well. I have a problem with authority, especially if I don't respect you. I need some more patience. As a result, full-time work is a little bit difficult for me if it's not the perfect fit.</p><p>I know my strengths as well. I'm creative and I have endurance. Therefore, I think blogging is a perfect fit. As someone who worked in finance for 13 years, got an MBA, and actively invests in multiple asset classes like stocks, real estate, private equity, venture debt, real estate crowdfunding, and so forth for the past 20 plus years, writing about financial topics comes really naturally to me.</p><p>I don't have to force it because I'm not making anything up. It's all from first-hand experience. I'm also not as driven by money because I had already made enough money before I started Financial Samurai. Of course, I would love to have more money and it would be nice to feel even more financially independent, but I'm not super driven by money, which is why it's been much easier to write for free for so long.</p><p>If I started a cooking site, I'm sure I'd quit within 12 months, maybe 6 months, because I have zero competitive advantage and no great interest in cooking. I'd rather just go out to eat and eat food by an expert than by me who just might chop his finger off while dicing the carrots.</p><p>So do what you're good at and outsource tasks in areas where you lack interest and expertise. Next, pivot if you're not growing or getting better. You've got to really be honest with yourself about your own progress. After about 3 years of working on your craft, if you're still spinning your wheels or just simply not getting anywhere, you've got to be honest with yourself and say, "Hey, you're not providing enough value," and you've got to pivot.</p><p>You've got to change your approach somehow. When it comes to growing a business, if you're not growing the way you want, you're simply not adding enough value. It's very simple. Everything is really rational in terms of business. Find new ways to add value. When it comes to getting better at a sport, if you're still losing to the same type of players, then you need a new coach and you need to work on some new skills.</p><p>And when it comes to increasing your net worth, if you're falling further and further behind, you've got to do a deep dive analysis to figure out what's wrong with your income, your savings, your type of investments, your returns. Maybe you have an overpriced or overpaid financial advisor. You've got to turn the bed upside down and figure out what's underneath.</p><p>You can't do the same thing over and over again and expect different results. Next, you've got to think much, much bigger. Way bigger. Whatever your vision is, think much, much bigger. When we're in high school, most of us think, "Oh, let's hope to get into a great university." And then when we're in university, we're like, "Let's hope to get into a great graduate school or get a great job." But instead of thinking about or dreaming about the next promotion or the next job or the school, why not think bigger like, "Hey, I dream of becoming the next CEO of a Fortune 500 company," or, "I dream of becoming the next great lifestyle entrepreneur or the next great inventor or the next mayor or senator or president of the United States." If you think big, big, big, you're going to take action to try to get there.</p><p>The likelihood of you getting there is not very high, but you're going to get farther than if you didn't think and dream as big as the person who's thinking, "Oh, just the next little step." So when I started Financial Samurai, I was just thinking, "Well, hopefully it'll make enough to fill the gap between my passive income investment, which was about $80,000 in 2012, and my desired lifestyle expenses, which is probably around $150,000." This was the plan for family.</p><p>And then after I started thinking, "Hey, maybe Financial Samurai could be a billion-dollar business," the site started doing better. And of course, it's not anywhere near a billion-dollar business, but it's large enough to provide fully for my family, my parents, and my in-laws. And that's far beyond what I had expected.</p><p>So the bigger your dream, the more you will achieve. Next, recognize how lucky you are. The more grateful you are, the more you will appreciate what you have. And the more you appreciate what you have, the harder you will work because you will never want to take what you have for granted.</p><p>This is why you see poor folks ascend and work so hard, or first-generation immigrants. If you can experience poverty, if you can see poverty, you kind of don't want to go back. You want to go forward. You want to move ahead. And this is the problem with America, I think, because life is generally so comfortable all around that we take our lifestyles for granted.</p><p>We eat a little too much. We exercise a little too little. We don't work as hard. Even though we are one of the most prosperous nations in the country, I think we can do better. And I think we can do better by being more appreciative of what we have.</p><p>Next, always know your why. Never forget why you are doing what you're doing for so long and for so hard. Financial Samurai, when I first started, it was to deal and cope with the financial loss of the financial crisis. Then I began writing for the community to try to help us figure out how to make more money and escape the rat race.</p><p>Now I mainly write to keep intellectually stimulated while also building an archive of content for my children. If money is your main goal, it's going to be a little difficult to keep your motivation. Money will disappoint you because it will never feel like you have enough, or if you get to your goal, whatever that is, you'll realize that money doesn't make you any happier.</p><p>So know your why because it will pull you forward. Next, know that things get easier. The great thing about doing something for a very long time is that you eventually gain mastery. You become an expert in whatever it is you're doing. And when you become an expert, things get easier.</p><p>And when things get easier, you can actually do more with less energy and more efficiency. And what happens there? Your productivity increases. And when your productivity increases, your returns are greater. The problem is, the problem is because things get easier, you see an endless amount of things you could do and you could eventually burn yourself out.</p><p>So make sure you give yourself breaks and walk away and separate yourself from what it is you really want to do and the other more important things in life. Next, you're stronger than you think. You can do more than you think. It's only after challenging yourself to the extreme will you realize your true abilities.</p><p>Whatever you think you're doing that you feel is very hard, please, please know that you can do more. I remember running track in high school and puking my guts out after a 200-meter race. My coach offered zero sympathy. Instead, she said, "Now you know what it's like to give everything you've got.</p><p>Now go run a cool-down lap." And that was the point where I was like, "Well, I guess she's right because I was dying, but I guess I had to run that cool-down lap in order for me to finish practice." I thought working 60 to 70 hours a week for 13 years in finance was hard until I decided I had to go to business school part-time just to save myself just in case I got let go.</p><p>Adding on another 20 to 30 hours a week on top of 60 to 70 hours a week was hell. It really was so, so terrible. But I got through it and once I graduated in 2006, working 60 to 70 hours a week in finance felt like a walk in the park.</p><p>I used to think publishing something interesting on Financial Samurai three times a week while also responding to comments and emails was hard. But after my son was born in 2017, I realize now that writing on Financial Samurai without children was like getting a full-body massage compared to full-time fatherhood.</p><p>And another thing, achieving financial freedom without kids now seems so, so easy. I had so much more time to hustle, to save, to work, to earn extra income, whatever it was during all hours of the day. I just had endless time. Now my time has been cut in half and it's just getting harder and harder because I'm getting older with less energy.</p><p>So if you don't have kids right now, know that life is actually pretty good and seize the moment, seize that energy to hustle and make more and save more. Because once you have kids, I tell you, it is really, really hard. So now I've got to learn how to do both.</p><p>Take care of my boy full-time and write and podcast full-time. It's not easy, so I just got to get it done. And I know I will get it done. I hope this podcast has given you some ideas and some tips on how to get to your 10-year mark. My one motto in life is never fail due to lack of effort because effort requires no skill.</p><p>I say this to myself whenever I'm feeling lazy or whenever I want to make excuses on why I can't get things done. Effort requires no skill. Just think about that. And I hope this saying will help you too. Your ultimate goal is to be proud of your effort. No matter what happens, whatever the results, so long as you know you did your best, you will be at peace with the results.</p><p>Regret is that one nagging thing that's going to eat you up inside. And you can eradicate regret if you do your best. So please try to focus on staying committed to that one thing you care about for at least 10 years. If you do, I promise you great things will happen.</p><p>Sorry this podcast was a little bit long, but hey, you don't get to 10 years too often. If you like this podcast, please leave a review. I'd love to hear from you.</p></div></div></body></html>
