We're here to talk to you today about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=66" target="_blank">00:01:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">really three different things. One is how we see AI reshaping knowledge work as we see it today,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=71" target="_blank">00:01:11.120</a></span> | <span class="t">so a lot of how it's impacting professional services, advisory services, that sort of thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=75" target="_blank">00:01:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">We'll bring three real-life use cases that we'll walk through in terms of how we've actually deployed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=80" target="_blank">00:01:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">it realistically, concretely within the way that we work in our business, and then wrap up with what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=85" target="_blank">00:01:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">doesn't work and where we see things going. So some of you here might recognize this chart from an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=90" target="_blank">00:01:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">organization called Meter, which evaluates the ability for LLMs to complete a certain set of tasks,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=97" target="_blank">00:01:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and it very specifically measures the length of task that LLMs can complete, at least with 50%</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">success rate. And so the takeoff rate is pretty significant here. Now, we think that's mostly because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">it's a verifiable domain, and as we all know, model capabilities are a little bit jagged, so they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.520</a></span> | <span class="t">perform very, very well in software development, maybe not so well in non-verifiable or more messy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">domains like knowledge work. So we think it's a rough proxy for the coming disruption for professional</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">services and knowledge work more broadly. Do we think the takeoff will be as steep as software</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">engineering? Probably not, just because of the messiness of the real world, if you will.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And for those of you not familiar, there's typically two main models for professional services. One is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.480</a></span> | <span class="t">junior-led model. This is where you have very senior individuals and more junior individuals provide that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">leverage. So it's a lot of directing, okay, do this, and you throw 50 people at a problem, and they kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=155" target="_blank">00:02:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">figure it out and probably waste some time in doing so. There's also the senior-led model, which is more senior</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">folks who have 15, 20 years of experience. They are much more involved in the day-to-day. They're actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">doing the work, delivering the work. This is the Alex Partners model, where it's a little bit less</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">leverage, but we can deliver results a lot faster and more impactfully because it's the senior-led</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">folks. We think the future is probably somewhat of a hybrid, but we think because of model capabilities</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">and how quickly they're advancing, it really provides that those more experienced folks, so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">people who have been in a particular domain or industry for 15, 20 years. If you've listened to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Dwarkesh Patel and his podcast, fantastic podcast, he has this concept of an AI-first firm, where you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">basically take the knowledge and start to replicate that out. So you can have 50 copies of the CEO, as an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">example. We think the future is something like that, where you have, you're basically replicating the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">knowledge, experience of more senior individuals, and you provide and you scale out that leverage</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">below using AI to do so. And so the way we think about typical engagements, it roughly falls into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">these three different buckets, not always, but just for demonstration purposes. There's a lot of upfront</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">work initially, whether it's an M&A transaction, a corporate investigation, some type of due diligence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Oftentimes you're left with a bunch of PDFs, databases, Excels, whatever it might be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">There's just a lot of upfront work to just understand what you've got, right?

That's the recommendation, the deliverable, the output, whatever that might be. That's the reason that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">they've hired you in the first place.

So if it was 50%, maybe it's 10 to 20% today in terms of what's required from a human</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">perspective just to get up to speed about understanding the contents of a data room or whatever it might be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's not only that, because to date you're largely limited by the throughput of human beings. So you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.680</a></span> | <span class="t">think of doc review as an example.

If you have 5,000 contracts, think of how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">many people it would take if it takes 30 minutes to review each and every contract.

You're only focusing on kind of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">top 20% or whatever it might be, the most valuable pieces of the data. With AI, that's completely changed,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.680</a></span> | <span class="t">right? You can now look at 100% of the corpus of data, whatever that might be. And you can start to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=355" target="_blank">00:05:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">derive insights.

So now you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">look at 100% of the vendor contracts, 100% of the customer base.

Using an LLM, you can get it down to minutes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=853" target="_blank">00:14:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">It's incredibly powerful. In terms of user trust, we not only are using external sources like Box and others as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=861" target="_blank">00:14:21.280</a></span> | <span class="t">well, but we've rolled our own internally as well. And so in terms of just exposing some of the model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=868" target="_blank">00:14:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">internals to users to have somewhat of an off-ramp for them to understand where the model is more or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=874" target="_blank">00:14:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">less confident, we use the logprobs that's returned from the OpenAI API, and we align that with the output</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=880" target="_blank">00:14:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">schema from structured outputs. So we ignore all the JSON data, we ignore the field names themselves, we just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=886" target="_blank">00:14:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">hone in on the values themselves. So in this case, the green box above the interest rate of LIBOR</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=892" target="_blank">00:14:52.560</a></span> | <span class="t">plus one percent per annum, that's the field that we want. We basically take the geometric mean of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=898" target="_blank">00:14:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">logprobs associated with those tokens in particular, and use that as a rough proxy of the model's confidence</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=904" target="_blank">00:15:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">in producing that output. So the boxes way at the beginning that you saw in terms of green and yellow is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=912" target="_blank">00:15:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">direct reflection of the confidence level. So it's a really relatively intuitive way for users to get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=917" target="_blank">00:15:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">an understanding of the model's confidence, again, for human review to the extent that's needed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=921" target="_blank">00:15:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I won't go through all these, but fundamentally, like I said, it is magic when it works, and it works at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=927" target="_blank">00:15:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">scale. It is a total unlock, particularly for non-technical folks who are not up to speed with the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=931" target="_blank">00:15:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">capabilities of LLMs. To be able to do this is a light switch, light bulb moment for them, and it really is a game</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=937" target="_blank">00:15:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">changer. Now, that being said, there's a lot of work to be done in terms of validation. You saw all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=943" target="_blank">00:15:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">work that Box and others have done in terms of getting it to a level of rigor that users can trust,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=948" target="_blank">00:15:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and so that's really a key tenet for all this. And so finally, I'll turn it to Mo for the must-haves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=955" target="_blank">00:15:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So just a couple quick call-outs. I know this is a tech conference, but a lot of this, to get to work at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=961" target="_blank">00:16:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">enterprise requires people skills and working closely with the organization. There are a couple things I want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=966" target="_blank">00:16:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">call out that have been really important for us to scale our Gen AI initiatives at our firm.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=969" target="_blank">00:16:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">The first one is demos. We build in Streamlit, but we prototype in Streamlit, but we build in React.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=977" target="_blank">00:16:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we have a constant cadence once a month that we show the latest and greatest of what we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=981" target="_blank">00:16:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">building. This inspires the firm in what we're able to build and continue to invest in our initiatives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=986" target="_blank">00:16:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And the second thing is, you know, there's always the next shiny thing. Agents, MCP,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=993" target="_blank">00:16:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the latest model. NPS is our metric. ROI is our metric, and that is one hard-earned, one bug fix at a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=1000" target="_blank">00:16:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">time. I'll skip the other one. You know, partnerships are really important. It's a shared journey, so.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=1005" target="_blank">00:16:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think we're out of time, but I'll leave you with this. Once Excel-powered</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1tAxKYLeE&t=1011" target="_blank">00:16:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">LLMs actually work, we will be at AGI. So I'm looking forward to that next talk. Thank you. Thank you.</span></div></div></body></html>
