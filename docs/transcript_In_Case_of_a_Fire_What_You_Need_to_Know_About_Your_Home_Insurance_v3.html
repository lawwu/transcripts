And in this episode, I want to talk about our home insurance policy. What is it? What goes into it? What are the various line items? We need to know what we're paying for because the Lahaina Maui fire disaster, that was terrible, terrible.</p><p>And it's a wake up call, another wake up call to know that anything can and will happen. These fires, they just came out of nowhere. It was dry, it was hot, the winds were gusting at 60 plus miles an hour, maybe a spark flew and started the fire. Who knows?</p><p>But one day it's paradise, the next day it's a disaster. My hope after you listen to this podcast is to call your home insurance company and understand what the heck your policy covers. Because it is pretty confusing and I want to go through some of the main points. The main points in this episode.</p><p>So you basically have coverage A, which is dwelling, coverage B, which is other structures, coverage C, personal property, and coverage D, loss of use. Then you've got a policy deductible where you've got to pay out of pocket before the home insurance policy can kick in. Then you've got coverage E, which is personal liability.</p><p>And then you have coverage F, medical payments to others. And then you have all these other additional coverages in your home insurance policy. You may or may not have it. Building ordinance or law coverage, extended replacement cost coverage, limited sewer or drain backup coverage, loss assessment coverage, actual cash value, roof endorsement, property held by trust or LLC, and then workers' compensation.</p><p>So the most important coverage is coverage A, which is dwelling. Coverage A dictates how much the insurance company pays for rebuilding a home. If you haven't updated your home insurance policy recently, I highly recommend doing it. Building costs have shot up since the pandemic began in 2020. Home values have also increased for the past three years, four years actually, for the past since 2012.</p><p>So if you haven't updated your dwelling amount coverage, you need to do so because you don't want to be stuck short in case of a fire or something else bad happening. There's also this thing called extensions. Could be automatic or you might have to ask for it. But in general, the average extension is about 125% of coverage.</p><p>So if you have a million dollars of coverage, well, if something bad happens, total destruction, the coverage amount will go up to 1.25 million. And you can ask for additional extension coverage. So up to 150,000. I just checked with my insurance company. But you have to pay a premium for that.</p><p>There may also be what's called a "guaranteed replacement cost extension." And if you got that, well, there's no question or debate about how much to rebuild. They'll just guarantee the total cost to rebuild your house. But I don't know if there's no debate. There seems to always be a debate when it comes to filing a claim with your insurance company.</p><p>Another important thing to know about coverage A dwelling is to be insured for "replacement cost," not actual cash value. You can do actual cash value, but the coverage is not as good. So replacement cost is replacement cost. Whatever it costs to replace your home, that's what the insurance company is going to pay.</p><p>But actual value only pays the depreciated cost of the home. Meaning the insurance company will only pay for a, let's say, 20-year-old roof and not the cost of a new roof. So that difference could be huge, especially if you have a very old home. With the preferable replacement cost policy, the insurance company may depreciate the home for the initial payout, but will pay that actual replacement cost once the item is built or purchased.</p><p>So this difference could be in the thousands or hundreds of thousands. Probably not hundreds of thousands, but thousands. And it also shows that there are two payouts. Initial payout and then once it's done. I mean, it could take two years to rebuild your home. All right. Coverage B, other structures.</p><p>The reason why price point of coverage A is important is because all of the other coverage limits are set by the coverage A limit. So for instance, let's say you have coverage B that includes patios, external fireplaces, fences, and an outdoor kitchen. Well, the maximum insurance that coverage B will pay for is 10% of your coverage A amount.</p><p>So if you have a million dollars of coverage A amount dwelling coverage, then coverage B is $100,000. So look around your home, see what you got, other structures besides your main house to see what you need covered. Now let's move on to coverage C, personal property. This is coverage amount given for all of the items lost.</p><p>T-shirts, speakers, kitchen appliances, furniture, all that stuff we accumulate over a lifetime. Just think about turning your house upside down without a roof and whatever falls outside your house, that is covered under coverage C, personal property. Now it is highly recommended, please do this after you listen to this podcast, to walk around your entire house with your phone and video record everything in every room in your house.</p><p>At least do that. You can take it a step further by itemizing every single item and putting a price and date of purchase and the estimate value into a Google spreadsheet, for example. But at least record with a video everything around your house because if goodness forbid something happens, a fire or whatnot, you can at least show video evidence of the personal property you own.</p><p>Now let's talk about coverage D, which is loss of use, use of your house and paying for a rental. So in the land of fire and mass chaos, owning is sometimes better than renting. It seems counterintuitive, but it could be true. One reader who lost his home to a fire talked to many people who were renters who were evicted since the fire.</p><p>The landlords asked their tenants to leave so that either the landlord or one of their friends or family members who lost a home could move in. And this puts tenants in a bad situation because now they are stuck in a town with a housing shortage and now higher prices.</p><p>This is something counterintuitive, but maybe it is intuitive. If there is mass devastation and a fire, the supply of homes goes down. Therefore the price of homes and rents may go up if people want to stay. And most people do want to return and want to stay. And that's what happened in the Tubbs fire in Northern California in 2017, 18, 19, 20.</p><p>So if your house becomes uninhabitable, smoke damage, everything burns down, your home insurance policy due to coverage D will cover the cost of you renting a place somewhere else. And the standard is 12 months. There's an amount you can pay for rent and it's 12 months. Sometimes it goes up to 24 months.</p><p>It depends on how much that coverage D amount is. So double check that. You may want to see how much a house of your similar quality rents for in your neighborhood or somewhere close by. And then use that amount times by 12 to figure out an appropriate coverage D amount.</p><p>Now 12 months might not be enough folks because it could take six months alone to go through the insurance policy to file the claim and agree on a settlement. And then it could take one or two years to build. Building times have elongated since the pandemic began in 2020.</p><p>And so I don't know if 12 months is enough. I would shoot for 24 months when you call your home insurance company. Next up is coverage E, personal liability. This is if someone falls on your property and sues you. This is something that you should get covered for. And then coverage F is medical payments to others.</p><p>This is if I guess they sue you, they have to go to the hospital, or maybe they don't sue you, they go to hospital and you don't have money to pay. Well, your home insurance policy will kick in. But remember, there is the policy deductible. Deductible amount could be 500 to 1000 to 1500 and up to 5000 to maybe 10,000.</p><p>Every home insurance company is different. So that's why you've got to call and ask what your deductible amount is. If you're wondering how much a home insurance policy costs, well, it's correlated to the cost of your home, the cost to build your home, the value of your home. The higher the price of your home, the more your home insurance policy is going to cost.</p><p>But it doesn't cost that much. So one example of a reader who said that he had a $1.2 million home, he paid about $1,200, no $1,300 a year with a $1,500 deductible. Then I looked online for how much it would cost to insure a $3 million home. I've seen $1,750 annual premiums with a $10,000 deductible.</p><p>So maybe with a lower deductible, it's closer to 2000. And then I checked how much it would cost to insure a $5 million home. And that was about $3,000 annual premium and a $5,000 deductible. So the amounts, it costs money, but it doesn't seem like it's that expensive to get home owners insurance coverage, especially if you are living in an area that's prone to flooding, fire, other natural disasters.</p><p>Earthquake insurance is completely separate, folks. So you've got to get a new policy for that. But insure your homes. It's worth it. And shop around for insurance policies, because if you haven't shopped around for a couple years, you can probably get a better deal. The easiest way to do it is through Policy Genius.</p><p>You go to financialsamurai.com/pgh, stands for Policy Genius Home, and you can get real quotes all in one place. And of course, you should call your existing insurance company to see if you can get a better deal. But the likely answer is no. They will likely want to raise your premiums because they'll ask you for an update on your home, you know, building costs and all this random stuff.</p><p>And if you want more coverage for extension and so forth. So you will likely not get a better deal with your existing home insurance company. You'll likely have to shop around. That's why going online is a smart idea. I just realized I didn't address whether home insurance covers fire.</p><p>In California, all home insurance policies cover fire, fire damage, fire smoke, and so forth. But double check anyway. I'm not sure what it's like for every single state. You need to ask your insurance company whether there is "fire exclusion" in your home insurance policy. So if there's fire exclusion, it means your home insurance policy doesn't cover your home for any fire damages, which is a no-no.</p><p>So if that is the case, you've got to get a new policy or you've got to get fire specific fire insurance coverage. I'm assuming every single state has different home insurance laws. So please ask specifically whether there is fire insurance coverage or if there's fire exclusion. You don't want to be caught with a surprise that you aren't covered for what you thought you were being covered for.</p><p>Very important. And also, for California residents, listeners, it is absolutely true. A lot of large insurance companies are no longer issuing new home insurance policies for homes. So if you're buying a home with a mortgage, you might have to shop around. You actually have to shop around. Now what's the reason for not insuring new homeowners in California, for example?</p><p>Well, the insurance companies are saying they have concentration risk in California and therefore they're trying to diversify away from California. They don't say they're never going to insure new homes in California again or make new policies again. They're just saying they need to diversify more and when their book of business is more diversified so that they can make money appropriately, because at the end of the day, insurance companies are in it to make money, then they will start renewing policies.</p><p>Start renewing policies, issuing new policies. And not all is lost, folks. If you live in California, you will be able to get another home insurance policy just from a different company that you might not have heard of, which could be dicey. I'm not sure. Obviously, the larger their insurance company, the bigger the balance sheet, the longer it's been around, the more comfort you will feel that the insurance company will actually pay out.</p><p>There are many, many smaller insurance companies that will cover new policies and also the price. The price of insurance isn't skyrocketing as far as I can tell in California. They seem quite reasonable because I checked around and not only could I find a new policy just with a different carrier, but the price is totally reasonable.</p><p>They weren't price gouging me at all. So don't worry there. Just like how we diversify our investment portfolios, insurance companies are diversifying their exposure across the country. And over time, I think a lot of these large folks will come back. But do be aware. Thanks so much, everyone, for listening.</p><p>I hope you learned a lot from this podcast episode.
