Genie 3 is designed and marketed to allow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHZy-iml5Q&t=40" target="_blank">00:00:40.200</a></span> | <span class="t">AI agents to act out scenarios and self-improve at taking actions.

Well, it did, and now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHZy-iml5Q&t=73" target="_blank">00:01:13.340</a></span> | <span class="t">we get real-time interaction in 720p, 24 frames per second.

First though, just a few thoughts from me. Jack Parker Holder, the lead author of Genie 3,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHZy-iml5Q&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.660</a></span> | <span class="t">told me and a bunch of journalists that the goal behind it was to have a Move 37 moment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHZy-iml5Q&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">for embodied AI, as in for robots, not just for computers that play games. A Move 37 moment is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHZy-iml5Q&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.300</a></span> | <span class="t">high bar, as any of you who have watched the AlphaGo documentary know, but think of it as a novel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHZy-iml5Q&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.620</a></span> | <span class="t">breakthrough that goes beyond human data. In other words, we just don't have enough data to train robots</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHZy-iml5Q&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.300</a></span> | <span class="t">reliably, given the innumerable scenarios in which they'll be placed. If we can simulate all worlds,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHZy-iml5Q&t=139" target="_blank">00:02:19.960</a></span> | <span class="t">then we might get novel breakthroughs for those robots, get them to do things essentially that we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHZy-iml5Q&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">couldn't have even trained them to do. In the presentation, I pushed back though, with the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHZy-iml5Q&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.900</a></span> | <span class="t">question that if these worlds suffer from physics inaccuracies, and they do, how would such agents</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHZy-iml5Q&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">ever be fully reliable? Both lead authors agreed that's a real issue, but then raised something that got me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHZy-iml5Q&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.780</a></span> | <span class="t">thinking. They said that yes, while you can't guarantee reliability, you can demonstrate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHZy-iml5Q&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.900</a></span> | <span class="t">unreliability. Think about it, if an agent goes off the rails in simulation, then it's also liable to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHZy-iml5Q&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.560</a></span> | <span class="t">so in the real world. In a way then, I think both of these points still stand. I think we can't guarantee</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHZy-iml5Q&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.660</a></span> | <span class="t">reliability with simulators like Genie 3, but we can help find unreliability. Anyway, what you're probably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHZy-iml5Q&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">thinking, and I definitely was, was that we should just be honest with ourselves. Everyone is gonna want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHZy-iml5Q&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.900</a></span> | <span class="t">upload a still from their favourite game, life event, celebrity, or what have you, and basically interact</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHZy-iml5Q&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.860</a></span> | <span class="t">with it, jump around, paint a wall, and just get silly. And even that is probably phrasing things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHZy-iml5Q&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.540</a></span> | <span class="t">somewhat maturely, which is probably why this is currently still a research preview. Meaning you can't get your hands on it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHZy-iml5Q&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Google were pretty evasive about timing for a general release, not even a hint of a date.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHZy-iml5Q&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">However, if that disappoints you, I am old enough to remember that that same, I guess, not for general release,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHZy-iml5Q&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">safety issues kind of thing, was true of Imagine 1, the very basic image generator from Google,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHZy-iml5Q&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.540</a></span> | <span class="t">basically not fit for public release. But as of today, we have Imagine 4 out in public, far improved,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHZy-iml5Q&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and even available on the API so developers can incorporate it into their apps.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHZy-iml5Q&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.660</a></span> | <span class="t">translated, Genie 4 might be available to you to play with sooner than you think.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHZy-iml5Q&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, but what about that incredible memory where you could paint a wall, for example, look around,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHZy-iml5Q&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">come back, and the paint is still there? Let's just take a moment and say, Google, that is pretty impressive,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHZy-iml5Q&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.700</a></span> | <span class="t">well done. But the memory within these worlds is measured in minutes, not hours. So if you were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHZy-iml5Q&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">thinking of making a friend in one of these worlds, building a house together, and living in it to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHZy-iml5Q&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">escape the real world and its current self-immolation, that won't quite work. As it currently stands,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHZy-iml5Q&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.360</a></span> | <span class="t">by the time you return to the house the next day, it will be completely reimagined. And Google told me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHZy-iml5Q&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.180</a></span> | <span class="t">of four other caveats. I think they are pretty telling about the future of simulation, so let's go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHZy-iml5Q&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.260</a></span> | <span class="t">through them. First, while the most common actions are performable, as you'd find in games like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHZy-iml5Q&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.140</a></span> | <span class="t">moving around and jumping, you can't currently perform complex actions. Next, and this thought</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHZy-iml5Q&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.680</a></span> | <span class="t">literally just came to me, but it's a bit like a dream, in that the next caveat is that you can't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHZy-iml5Q&t=319" target="_blank">00:05:19.980</a></span> | <span class="t">talk to other characters. Maybe that's just me, but in your dreams, do you speak to other people?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHZy-iml5Q&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Definitely not complex conversations. Anyway, they said to me, accurately modeling complex interactions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHZy-iml5Q&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.540</a></span> | <span class="t">between multiple independent agents is still an ongoing research challenge. Third, as you would expect,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHZy-iml5Q&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.720</a></span> | <span class="t">we can't expect accurate representation of real-world locations. The sheer imaginative</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHZy-iml5Q&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.380</a></span> | <span class="t">scope of these worlds are also somewhat their downfall in that lifelike fidelity is not their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHZy-iml5Q&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">priority. That bleeds into the fourth caveat they gave me, which is text rendering. Don't expect</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHZy-iml5Q&t=356" target="_blank">00:05:56.440</a></span> | <span class="t">high-fidelity text rendering. It can happen if you add it to your prompt, it's just not built into the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHZy-iml5Q&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.180</a></span> | <span class="t">environment. Now, funnily enough, I think it was a Guardian or New York Times journalist asked,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHZy-iml5Q&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.360</a></span> | <span class="t">actually, about whether this is a replacement for something like Omniverse or Unreal Engine. Google</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHZy-iml5Q&t=372" target="_blank">00:06:12.420</a></span> | <span class="t">wouldn't say that, but they did say that hard-coding the complexity of the real world is intractable,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHZy-iml5Q&t=378" target="_blank">00:06:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">so that's why we might need simulations like the Genie series. I know quite a few game developers watch</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHZy-iml5Q&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the channel, so do chip in with your thoughts on this versus Unreal Engine. And I would add, there's a hybrid</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHZy-iml5Q&t=392" target="_blank">00:06:32.040</a></span> | <span class="t">approach, which I saw recently in a TED talk from a guy from Roblox. I forget his name and his rank,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHZy-iml5Q&t=398" target="_blank">00:06:38.340</a></span> | <span class="t">but the idea was that you could prompt a model to directly code new parts of the environment. The full</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHZy-iml5Q&t=405" target="_blank">00:06:45.820</a></span> | <span class="t">six-minute talk is linked in the description. But this feels to me like it would be slightly more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHZy-iml5Q&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.740</a></span> | <span class="t">predictable, perhaps? But maybe less scalable, because with the Genie series, you could scale it with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHZy-iml5Q&t=416" target="_blank">00:06:56.740</a></span> | <span class="t">billions of hours of video from YouTube, not so much with hard-coded assets. Which approach will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHZy-iml5Q&t=422" target="_blank">00:07:02.040</a></span> | <span class="t">win out? I actually don't know, so let me know what you think. Now, enough build-up. There is no paper</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHZy-iml5Q&t=427" target="_blank">00:07:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to go through.
