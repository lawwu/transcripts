If you look at my home screen right now, I put a fake flight on here just so I could talk about it. They have a great sheet to show up on your iPhone when you're waiting for a flight, so you could just kind of keep an eye on it.</p><p>When anything happens, I usually get an alert from flighty before I've even gotten alert from the airline. Each flight, they give you an arrival forecast. So it shows you like how frequently is this flight early, on time, 45 minutes late? Where's the plane coming from? What kind of plane is it?</p><p>They give you the detailed timetable of like, not just departs at 2.30 for this random flight, but taxi scheduled for 10 minutes. It's gonna depart at 2.40. It's gonna land at 11.07, gate arrival 11.22. Here's how long it's gonna be in the air. Here's my history on the route.</p><p>So I pulled up a random flight from LA to New York, and it says, "Hey, you actually took a flight, "United 82 from LA to New York on June 5th, 2010."</p></div></div></body></html>
