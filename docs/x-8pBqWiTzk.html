Who's excited to chat about MCP today?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=18" target="_blank">00:00:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, we can work on that. We can get it a little bit better by the end of this talk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=24" target="_blank">00:00:24.340</a></span> | <span class="t">But I'm Theo. I am a product manager at Anthropic, work on MCP. Prior to this, was also a startup founder, working in the AI space.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=35" target="_blank">00:00:35.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Couple fun facts about me, because everyone says make yourself a little bit more personable, is I like playing poker, mostly losing money at poker, not making money at poker, and I also really like coffee.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=48" target="_blank">00:00:48.680</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're a huge coffee fan and want to talk about the best coffee in San Francisco, hit me up after the talk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=56" target="_blank">00:00:56.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But you didn't come here to talk about me. You came here to learn about MCP. So let's talk about MCP.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=64" target="_blank">00:01:04.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I was told not to say MCP is the best thing since sliced bread, which I won't say, but mostly because I don't actually think it's the best thing since sliced bread.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=75" target="_blank">00:01:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">My goal here today is to really walk you through the origin story of MCP, why we launched it, give you a better sense of where it can actually help you in your workflow,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=88" target="_blank">00:01:28.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And then ultimately give you a sense of the types of questions that I'm frequently hearing, where I think there's a lot of value to build in the ecosystem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=97" target="_blank">00:01:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And let you decide for yourself whether or not it is actually the best thing since sliced bread.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=104" target="_blank">00:01:44.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So scrolling all the way back to mid last year, the co-creators of MCP, David and Justin, had this idea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">They were seeing that, you know, classic two engineers in a garage style.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=118" target="_blank">00:01:58.680</a></span> | <span class="t">They were seeing that they were constantly copying and pasting context from outside of the context window into the context window.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So you're doing your workflow and suddenly you're remembering that there was a Slack message that was really important that had a lot of context that you could just copy in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So you're constantly kind of copying things back and forth from Slack.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=138" target="_blank">00:02:18.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe you're copying things in from Sentry, your error logs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But they were kind of realizing, hey, it would be so great if Claude or any LLM could just kind of climb out of its box, reach out into the real world,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and bring that context and those actions to the model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the genesis of MCP was really around this big question of not just context but model agency.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.680</a></span> | <span class="t">How do you actually give the model the ability to interact with the outside world?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so as they started thinking about this, they came to the conclusion that it had to be an open source standardized protocol</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">in order for this to make sense at scale.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reason is, of course, as you all know, if you want to build an integration and the actor or the client in this case that has to leverage that integration is using a closed source ecosystem,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.680</a></span> | <span class="t">then you need maybe a BD or partnerships angle with that client to actually get access to the team, to integrate with them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.680</a></span> | <span class="t">You then have to align on the right interface, and then you get to actually build the thing itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the idea here was that model agency was the biggest thing that was stopping LLMs from actually reaching the next stage of usefulness and intelligence,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">as we saw that reasoning models were becoming more and more the future, that tool calling was getting better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.680</a></span> | <span class="t">We really wanted to make sure that we were making it possible for everyone to get involved in that ecosystem and actually allow the models to, again, have agency.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So they form a small tiger team internally, work on this protocol, and launch it at our company Hack Week in November of last year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And this was really the first turning point of MCP.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.680</a></span> | <span class="t">It went viral, as you can imagine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Engineers from various teams were working on building MCPs to automate their own workflows.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.680</a></span> | <span class="t">They were working on MCPs to automate other teams' workflows.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.680</a></span> | <span class="t">This was really kind of a cool moment to see how it went from, again, like two engineers in a garage,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.680</a></span> | <span class="t">all the way to this is a major moment and turning point where we think we actually unlocked some true value for other people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we ultimately ended up open sourcing MCP in November of last year,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and that's when we introduced it to the rest of the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But as most builders know, when you build something zero to one,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you think the launch moment is going to be really impactful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=302" target="_blank">00:05:02.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But it actually usually is not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=305" target="_blank">00:05:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">At launch, most people were saying things like, what's MCP?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Or even worse, or maybe, you know, rightfully so, what's MPC?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And more often than not, we got this question of,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't really understand why you need a new protocol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't really understand why it has to be open source.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Can't models call tools already?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">This was the slew of questions that kind of came again and again for probably from the era of November,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">all the way even to early this year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And it really took making it possible for builders to kind of get their hands dirty with building MCPs to automate their own workflow for this to take off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=353" target="_blank">00:05:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the next turning point, as Henry alluded to, was when Cursor kind of adopted MCP.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And after that, a lot of other coding tools also adopted MCP.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">VS Code, Source Graph, et cetera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.680</a></span> | <span class="t">We had a lot of coding IDEs start adopting MCP.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=372" target="_blank">00:06:12.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's really where that next stage of momentum came in where agency was given to builders to actually build MCPs for themselves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=383" target="_blank">00:06:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And more recently, we've seen kind of another turning point where Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, and many others have also adopted MCP.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=393" target="_blank">00:06:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're really excited to see this kind of become more and more the standard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But ultimately, standards become standards because they are actually useful to builders.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=404" target="_blank">00:06:44.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I kind of want to ask all of you to keep us honest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=409" target="_blank">00:06:49.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Contribute when you see issues with the way that the protocol is built today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=416" target="_blank">00:06:56.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Or if you even want to take that one step further and submit a PR directly to the GitHub repo and fix the issue, that would be even better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=425" target="_blank">00:07:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But our goal here is really to make it maximally useful for you all and for model providers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=432" target="_blank">00:07:12.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So thank you for your help in even getting us to the point where I can be speaking on stage about this less than one year later.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=442" target="_blank">00:07:22.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So just to get a little bit deeper into what we were solving for at the start of building MCP is, again, this kind of idea of model agency.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=454" target="_blank">00:07:34.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And part of that means agents is kind of the direction that we think is going to be the future.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=460" target="_blank">00:07:40.680</a></span> | <span class="t">That's no surprise to anyone in this room.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=462" target="_blank">00:07:42.680</a></span> | <span class="t">You are probably going to hear the word agents said in every talk, if not almost every talk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=469" target="_blank">00:07:49.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But the way that we think about agents is that you are giving the model, or you're rather depending on the model's intelligence to choose actions and decide what to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=482" target="_blank">00:08:02.680</a></span> | <span class="t">In the same way that, you know, maybe when you talk to a human and you ask them for a response, you don't know exactly what the response is, but based on your understanding of maybe the task that you've given them, your hope is that they are going to give you the right response.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=497" target="_blank">00:08:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And we want to kind of enable that world where you're depending on the model's intelligence scaling over time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=506" target="_blank">00:08:26.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So that leads to principles in how we actually build the protocol itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=513" target="_blank">00:08:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Recently, we launched the support for Streamable HTTP, which changes the transport from SSE.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=521" target="_blank">00:08:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And as you all might know, Streamable HTTP enables more bidirectionality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=528" target="_blank">00:08:48.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that was a very controversial decision, actually.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=532" target="_blank">00:08:52.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you're keeping agents in mind as the future, it makes a lot of sense because you want to make sure that agents can kind of communicate with each other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=540" target="_blank">00:09:00.680</a></span> | <span class="t">The other thing that we believe is that there will be a lot more servers than there are clients.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=547" target="_blank">00:09:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">We could be totally wrong on this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=549" target="_blank">00:09:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I would love to see where the future plays out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=552" target="_blank">00:09:12.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But because we think that there will be a lot more servers than there are clients, we optimized for server simplicity and for the server builders to have better tooling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=564" target="_blank">00:09:24.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And that does mean when we have to make a trade-off between client complexity or server complexity, we tend to optimize for pushing the complexity down to the client.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=573" target="_blank">00:09:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So I apologize in advance to client builders, but it was an intentional decision.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=578" target="_blank">00:09:38.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, I would be curious to see if this plays out the way that we thought it would.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=586" target="_blank">00:09:46.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm going to speed run through some project updates, mostly because other talks are going to go much more in detail here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=593" target="_blank">00:09:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But last six months, we launched ability for folks to build remote MCPs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=600" target="_blank">00:10:00.680</a></span> | <span class="t">We fixed auth, which we got wrong initially.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=604" target="_blank">00:10:04.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=605" target="_blank">00:10:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So I know that was a huge, huge thing that we got wrong initially, but it is now fixed in the draft spec.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=611" target="_blank">00:10:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we'd love folks to continue helping to push on these things that they see don't match their mental model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=620" target="_blank">00:10:20.680</a></span> | <span class="t">This was actually fixed via a series of people from the community jumping in to work on saying, hey, this is how auth works with identity providers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=632" target="_blank">00:10:32.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and here's how we can update the protocol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=634" target="_blank">00:10:34.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So very much a community effort.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=638" target="_blank">00:10:38.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, launched renewable HTTP as the primary transport.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=642" target="_blank">00:10:42.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And lastly, made a couple of updates to the developer experience by updating our SDKs and also making updates to inspector, which if you aren't familiar with, is a really good debugging tool for your server.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=656" target="_blank">00:10:56.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it is probably our most underutilized tool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=661" target="_blank">00:11:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Looking forward, we're going to be focusing a lot more on that agent experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=666" target="_blank">00:11:06.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So we just added elicitation to the draft spec.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=671" target="_blank">00:11:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">This allows servers to ask for more information from end users.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=677" target="_blank">00:11:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can imagine you're building a-- maybe you're building a flight booking tool, and the end user says, hey, book me the best flight to Atlanta.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=688" target="_blank">00:11:28.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so as the server, you have a question, which is what does best mean to you?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=693" target="_blank">00:11:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Is it cheapest or is it fastest?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=695" target="_blank">00:11:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So you ask the end user, and now you can pass through that elicitation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=699" target="_blank">00:11:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">The end user can respond and have that response ultimately sent back to the server.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=703" target="_blank">00:11:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">We are also making progress on the registry API, which would make it a lot easier for models to actually find MCPs that weren't already given to them upfront.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=715" target="_blank">00:11:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is, again, kind of on that theme of model agency.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=719" target="_blank">00:11:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">We're really betting on the intelligence of models going up over time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=723" target="_blank">00:12:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, working on developer experience, we've heard often from you all that there are-- that, you know, you'd love to understand what kind of the best patterns are in the ecosystem or what the standards are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=737" target="_blank">00:12:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we want to make sure that there are open source examples that both we've contributed to and also the community can contribute to to kind of help build those standards and patterns together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=747" target="_blank">00:12:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And lastly, we're making sure that MCP stays open forever, and we are investing heavily in thinking about the next phase of governance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=760" target="_blank">00:12:40.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So there will be more updates on that soon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=763" target="_blank">00:12:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And just to do a quick call-out to the graphic in the bottom, so a lot of people have asked us what it looks like to actually build an agent with MCP.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=775" target="_blank">00:12:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So our take is that an agent really is just a server acting as a client and vice versa, where you can then kind of chat back and forth with other agents, other servers, other clients.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=788" target="_blank">00:13:08.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So I won't go into too much detail there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=790" target="_blank">00:13:10.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I know a lot of other people are going to be talking about agents in more detail, but I just wanted to make sure that I call that out here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=801" target="_blank">00:13:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So the thing that everyone has probably been waiting for and that I've been told over and over again when I talk to founders, what they're asking me about is what should I build in this space?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=814" target="_blank">00:13:34.680</a></span> | <span class="t">If MCP becomes a standard, where are the interesting opportunities?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=820" target="_blank">00:13:40.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So before jumping into this, the first thing I'll say is that we are really early right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=827" target="_blank">00:13:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And that means that even if the standard exists, we still need the ecosystem to be filled out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=832" target="_blank">00:13:52.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And I would urge you to build more and more and more servers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=836" target="_blank">00:13:56.680</a></span> | <span class="t">If I had to put a weighting on these three bullet points, I would put 80% on the first one, 10% on the second one, and 10% on the third one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=845" target="_blank">00:14:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have a lot of opportunity to build a lot more servers that are higher quality and for different verticals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=854" target="_blank">00:14:14.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And just to touch quickly on what I mean by higher quality, a lot of people, you know, maybe hot take, but I think a lot of people are wrapping their API endpoints one-to-one and just exposing that as tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=867" target="_blank">00:14:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So I don't think that's the right way to build an MCP server.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=870" target="_blank">00:14:30.680</a></span> | <span class="t">That in and of itself could probably be a 20-minute talk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=873" target="_blank">00:14:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But what you really have to remember when you're building a server is that you have three users.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=878" target="_blank">00:14:38.680</a></span> | <span class="t">You have the end user, the client developer, and the model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=882" target="_blank">00:14:42.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So a lot of people forget that the model is a user here as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=885" target="_blank">00:14:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">You want to, just as you would for API design, you want to think about what are the use cases that your end users are going to have?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=891" target="_blank">00:14:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">What are the prompts that they might actually be putting into the model?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=896" target="_blank">00:14:56.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And ultimately, what are the tools that you then need to expose to the model to enable the model to respond correctly to those prompts?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=904" target="_blank">00:15:04.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So higher quality servers and also servers for different verticals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=910" target="_blank">00:15:10.680</a></span> | <span class="t">A lot of the servers today have been for DevTools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=914" target="_blank">00:15:14.680</a></span> | <span class="t">We would love to see this expand to be useful beyond engineers into verticals like sales, finance, legal, education, pick your poison, whatever you know best.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=925" target="_blank">00:15:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">We would just love to see more servers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=929" target="_blank">00:15:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">The next piece is on simplifying server building.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=933" target="_blank">00:15:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, as I mentioned, we believe strongly that servers are going to be the vast majority of the ecosystem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=940" target="_blank">00:15:40.680</a></span> | <span class="t">There will, of course, be a lot of clients as well, but we think the order of magnitude of servers is going to outweigh the order of magnitude of clients.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=949" target="_blank">00:15:49.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we would love to see a lot more tooling to actually make it easier and easier to build servers, both for enterprises that are deploying MCPs internally as interfaces between teams and for indie hackers and everything in between that are building MCPs for external users.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=967" target="_blank">00:16:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So anything from hosting tooling, testing tooling, evals, deployment, et cetera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=975" target="_blank">00:16:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I snuck a bullet in here that's maybe a little bit more of a moonshot and a bet on the future, but there's a bullet for automated MCP server generation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=986" target="_blank">00:16:26.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, if you kind of think back to our bet on model intelligence and model agency for the future, at some point models will be so good writing code and interacting with the external world that they will actually be able to write their own MCPs on the fly in real time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=1006" target="_blank">00:16:46.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this might be a little early for where we are today, but I do think that there will be an opportunity for automated MCP generation as models get smarter and smarter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=1019" target="_blank">00:16:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And last but not least, I wanted to do a quick call out for any tooling around AI security, observability, auditing, et cetera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=1029" target="_blank">00:17:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think this is actually specific to MCP.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=1032" target="_blank">00:17:12.680</a></span> | <span class="t">This is true for any AI application, but I think the more that you enable those applications to have access to the outside world, to start playing with real data, of course, the security and privacy, et cetera, implications also go up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=1046" target="_blank">00:17:26.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I think if you're going to build a startup in that space, now is the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=1054" target="_blank">00:17:34.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So with that, happy MCP-ing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=1056" target="_blank">00:17:36.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-8pBqWiTzk&t=1057" target="_blank">00:17:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you.</span></div></div></body></html>
