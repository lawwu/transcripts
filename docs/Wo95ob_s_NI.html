Oh, yeah. Five years. Yeah. I think the models</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">will get quite a bit better in the course of five years. I think even in one or two years,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">we'll find that you can use them for a lot of more involved tasks than they can do now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">For example, right now, you could imagine having the models carry out a whole coding project</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">instead of maybe giving you one suggestion on how to write a function. You could imagine the model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">giving it high-level instructions on what to code up. It'll go and write many files and test it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">look at the output, iterate on that a bit. So just much more complex tasks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Fundamentally, the unlock is that it can act coherently for long enough to write</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.640</a></span> | <span class="t">multiple files of code. What has changed between now and then?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. I would say this will come from some combination of just training the models to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">do harder tasks like this. Most of the training data is more like doing single steps at a time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and I would expect us to do more for training the models to carry out these longer projects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'd say any kind of training, like doing RL to learn how to do these tasks,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">however you do it, whether you're supervising the final output or supervising it each step,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I think any kind of training at carrying out these long projects is going to make them a lot better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And since the whole area is pretty new, I'd say there's just a lot of low-hanging fruit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">in doing this kind of training. So I'd say that's one thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Also, I would expect that as the models get better, they're just better at recovering</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">from errors, or they're better at dealing with edge cases, or when things go wrong,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">they know how to recover from it. So the models will be more sample efficient, so you don't have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">to collect a ton of data to teach them how to get back on track. Just a little bit of data or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">just their generalization from other abilities will allow them to get back on track, whereas</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">current models might just get stuck and get lost. I'm not sure I understand, actually,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">how the generalization helps you get back on track. Can you say more about that? I'm not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">sure I got why those two concepts are connected. Right, they're not directly connected. So I would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.120</a></span> | <span class="t">say you usually have a little bit of data that does everything. So I mean, if you collect a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=367" target="_blank">00:06:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">diverse data set, you're going to get a little bit of everything in it. And if you have models</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=373" target="_blank">00:06:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">that generalize really well, even if there's just a couple examples of getting back on track,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">like maybe in the pre-training, there's examples of getting back on track, then the model will be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=385" target="_blank">00:06:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">able to generalize from those other things it's seen to the current situation.

So I don't remember exactly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=940" target="_blank">00:15:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">how many examples, but something like 30, 30 examples.

And we would, uh, we might</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1062" target="_blank">00:17:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">want to, um, like, uh, slow down a little bit on, uh, training and deployment until we're pretty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1068" target="_blank">00:17:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">sure we know, uh, we, we can deal with it safely.

So I think, uh, yeah, we would have to be,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1081" target="_blank">00:18:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">we'd have to be very careful, um, if it happened way sooner than expected, because I think, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1087" target="_blank">00:18:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">our understanding is rudimentary in a lot of ways still.

You do these evaluations before</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1096" target="_blank">00:18:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you're, um, yeah, I would say, uh, just like, uh, uh, maybe not, um, uh, not training the even</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1104" target="_blank">00:18:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">smarter version of not like being really careful when you do train it, that it's not, uh, it's,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1110" target="_blank">00:18:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">um, like properly sandbox and everything, um, maybe not deploying it at scale, um, or yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1118" target="_blank">00:18:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">being, uh, yeah, being careful, careful about what, um, what scale you deploy it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1123" target="_blank">00:18:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I guess I'm not. Okay. So let's just play with a scenario. Like it happens next year and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1130" target="_blank">00:18:50.560</a></span> | <span class="t">then, uh, you're, you're not training a smarter system, but, and then you're, you're deploying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1137" target="_blank">00:18:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">somewhat in a measured way. Um, I, yeah, I'm wondering, well, presumably if this is just,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1149" target="_blank">00:19:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">this isn't particular to OPN and AI, but this is just intelligence. It was just much easier</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1153" target="_blank">00:19:13.680</a></span> | <span class="t">than we expected. And this is why it happened. Um, and so you wait to deploy a little bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1158" target="_blank">00:19:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, other companies have the similar level of capabilities. What, what happens next? So you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1163" target="_blank">00:19:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">you've waited to deploy, what are you waiting for? What are you talking with these? What,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1167" target="_blank">00:19:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">what does every company doing in this scenario? Yeah. Yeah. The game theory is a little tough to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1172" target="_blank">00:19:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">think through. So, oh yeah. So first of all, I don't think this is going to happen next year,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1176" target="_blank">00:19:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">but it's still useful to have the conversation and maybe it's like two or three years instead.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1180" target="_blank">00:19:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">But, um, yeah, I guess it's still pretty soon. I do think, uh, you probably need some coordination.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1187" target="_blank">00:19:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, uh, everyone needs to agree on some, uh, on some reasonable, uh, like limits to deployment or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1194" target="_blank">00:19:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">to further training, uh, for this to work. Otherwise, uh, otherwise you have the, the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1200" target="_blank">00:20:00.160</a></span> | <span class="t">race dynamics where everyone's trying to, everyone's trying to stay ahead and, uh, like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1204" target="_blank">00:20:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">everyone's, uh, like, and that might require compromising on safety. So I think you would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1210" target="_blank">00:20:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">probably need some coordination among the, uh, larger entities that are doing this kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1216" target="_blank">00:20:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">training. And so you're coordinating to, um, I guess pause deployment until, until what exactly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1224" target="_blank">00:20:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">like, until you figure out what's happening in the models or like pause, uh, either, uh, further</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1228" target="_blank">00:20:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">training, pause deployment, uh, like, uh, avoid certain types of training that we think might be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1235" target="_blank">00:20:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">riskier. Uh, so just, uh, like setting up some reasonable rules for, uh, um, like, uh, what,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1243" target="_blank">00:20:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">what everyone should do to, uh, yeah. Uh, having everyone somewhat limit, uh, limit these things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1249" target="_blank">00:20:49.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And, but, uh, limit to what end, because I guess at some point, then you're going to have to like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1254" target="_blank">00:20:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">do the potential energy that's within this intelligence will, uh, uh, you know, it'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1259" target="_blank">00:20:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">be unleashed. So, uh, what, what, what, what, what is the plan to do? Like suppose in two years,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1264" target="_blank">00:21:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">we get the AGI and now everybody's freaking out. And so now the AI companies have paused. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1270" target="_blank">00:21:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and now what, or is, or what, what, what would be the plan to wait till, or.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1275" target="_blank">00:21:15.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, that's, uh, I don't have a good answer to that. I mean, I would say, um, if we can,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1281" target="_blank">00:21:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">if everyone is going to coordinate like that, uh, I think we would be, that would be an okay</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1287" target="_blank">00:21:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">scenario. That would be a pretty good scenario. Cause I do think, uh, like, um, building these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1294" target="_blank">00:21:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">models is very capital intensive and, uh, there are a lot of complex pieces. So it's not like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1299" target="_blank">00:21:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">everyone's going to go and recreate this stuff at home. Uh, so I think it is possible to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1305" target="_blank">00:21:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">get given the relatively small number of entities who could train the largest models. It does seem</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1310" target="_blank">00:21:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">possible to coordinate. So I'm not sure how, uh, how you would maintain this, uh, this equilibrium</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1318" target="_blank">00:21:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">for a long period of time.

So today's RLHF, the way in which it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1799" target="_blank">00:29:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">influences these models is, would you characterize it as in terms of human psychology? Is it a drive?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1805" target="_blank">00:30:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Is it a goal? Is it an impulse? Like psychologically, what kind of thing, in what way is it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1812" target="_blank">00:30:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">being changed? And I, I'm not, not just like the persona of a chat bot, but just like, don't talk</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1817" target="_blank">00:30:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">that way, talk this other way, or don't, don't put those kinds of outputs. Yeah. I would say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1821" target="_blank">00:30:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">there are probably some analogies with a driver goal in humans. So in that, um, you have, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1828" target="_blank">00:30:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">you're trying to steer towards a certain set of states rather than some other states. Um, and so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1834" target="_blank">00:30:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I, I would, I would think that our concept of a driver goal has, um, other, um, elements like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1841" target="_blank">00:30:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, like the feeling of satisfaction you get for achieving it. And, uh, and those things might,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1847" target="_blank">00:30:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">um, be more like have more to do with the learning algorithm than, uh, what the model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1851" target="_blank">00:30:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">does at runtime, uh, when you just have a fixed model. So I would say, I would say there are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1858" target="_blank">00:30:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">probably some analogies though. Um, it's, uh, I don't know exactly, um, like how, how close it is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1865" target="_blank">00:31:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">but I would say to some extent it is, um, it, the models, um, do have drives and goals in some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1872" target="_blank">00:31:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">meaningful way. And in, in the case of RLHF, where you're trying to, um, maximize, um, human approval</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1878" target="_blank">00:31:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">as measured by a reward model, the model is just trying to produce something that people are going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1882" target="_blank">00:31:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to like and the, and is, they're going to judge as correct. I've heard two ideas in terms of using</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1888" target="_blank">00:31:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that inner monologue type of thing to get better at reasoning, at least publicly, the kinds of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1894" target="_blank">00:31:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">things I've seen. And I'm curious what you think is more promising. One is that the model learns</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1901" target="_blank">00:31:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">from, it outputs a bunch of potential trains of thought, and it learns to follow the one that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1907" target="_blank">00:31:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">leads to the correct answer and is trained on that before deployment. And the other one is you use a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1915" target="_blank">00:31:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">bunch of compute to do inference in deployment, which involves the model talking to itself after,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1921" target="_blank">00:32:01.040</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, while, while it's deployed, which one do you expect it to be closer to when it's like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1926" target="_blank">00:32:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">really good at reasoning? Is it because it's doing just a bunch of inference clouds or is it just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1929" target="_blank">00:32:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">because you've trained it to do all of that? Well, I would say you could define reasoning as, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1935" target="_blank">00:32:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">tasks that require some kind of, uh, uh, like computation, um, at test time, or maybe some kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1941" target="_blank">00:32:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">of, uh, deduction. Um, so, so by definition, reasoning would be tasks that require, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1949" target="_blank">00:32:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">like some test time computation and, uh, like step-by-step computation. Um, on the other hand,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1956" target="_blank">00:32:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I would also, um, expect to gain a lot out of, um, like doing some kind of, um, training time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1963" target="_blank">00:32:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">computation or practice that training time. Uh, so, so I would think that, um, you get the best</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1969" target="_blank">00:32:49.360</a></span> | <span class="t">results by combining, uh, combining these two things. So my uncle had prostate cancer and I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1976" target="_blank">00:32:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">wanted to know my own risk and I got a 23andMe test, but it was mostly useless. I mean, the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1982" target="_blank">00:33:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">whole, what are your odds of liking chocolate is not what I was looking for. So I exported my data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1987" target="_blank">00:33:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">onto Nucleus Genomics and immediately I got my risk profile for almost two dozen diseases,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1992" target="_blank">00:33:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">including prostate cancer. And it turns out my risk is higher than 97% of people with my ancestry,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=1998" target="_blank">00:33:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">which is a very useful thing to know because I now I know to get screened early. Ironically,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2002" target="_blank">00:33:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">tests like 23andMe don't even look at the variants which have the largest impact,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2006" target="_blank">00:33:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">including for prostate cancer.

And that's why I pre-ordered Nucleus Premium whole genome sequencing. It's the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2018" target="_blank">00:33:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">only clinical grade test that reads 100% of your DNA.

So if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2029" target="_blank">00:33:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">want to live a long and healthy life, you can pre-order Nucleus Premium at mynucleus.com.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2035" target="_blank">00:33:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, back to John. Right now, you know, you have these two ways in which the model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2041" target="_blank">00:34:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">learns. It's either in training, whether it's free training or with the post-training, but it's like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2046" target="_blank">00:34:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">most of the computing training is spent on free training and just glossing over trillions of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2051" target="_blank">00:34:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">tokens, just like standing by as a, you know, like almost like skimming trillions of tokens</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2057" target="_blank">00:34:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">worth of information, which if a human was subjected to that would just be totally confused,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2063" target="_blank">00:34:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">right? It's like not a very efficient way to learn. And the other way is in context learning,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2068" target="_blank">00:34:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">but of course that is more sample efficient there, but it's destroyed with each instance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2073" target="_blank">00:34:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm curious if you think that there's a path for something in between those where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2079" target="_blank">00:34:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">it's not destroyed with each instance, but it's also not as,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2083" target="_blank">00:34:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">not as sort of frivolous as just seeing trillions of tokens where it's more deliberate and active.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2091" target="_blank">00:34:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So do you mean models having some kind of medium term memory, so too much to fit in context,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2099" target="_blank">00:34:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">but like much smaller scale than pre-training? I'm not sure if memory, it might be memory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2104" target="_blank">00:35:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't have context, but certainly like when I, when I'm trying to prepare for this conversation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2110" target="_blank">00:35:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">it feels like I think of like what I should understand this. So I look it up and I like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2116" target="_blank">00:35:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">read it carefully and I maybe think about it as I'm reading it. And I'm not sure what it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2120" target="_blank">00:35:20.560</a></span> | <span class="t">naturally corresponds to in terms of models, but what would that look like? I'm curious.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2125" target="_blank">00:35:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I see. So it's not just a memory, but it's also somewhat like specializing to a task</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2130" target="_blank">00:35:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that specializing to a certain task or putting a lot of effort into like some particular project.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2136" target="_blank">00:35:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm not sure it's specialization more. So I'm thinking about, I don't understand this part. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2141" target="_blank">00:35:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">let me look into this part deeper. I already understand this. I'm going to like specializing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2144" target="_blank">00:35:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">to your existing knowledge base. Yeah. I see. So it's not just about finding like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2152" target="_blank">00:35:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know, training on a bunch of sources that are relevant, fine tuning on some special</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2156" target="_blank">00:35:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">domain. It's also about like, uh, like reasoning about like developing some knowledge through your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2161" target="_blank">00:36:01.600</a></span> | <span class="t">own reasoning and also using some sort of, uh, introspection and self-knowledge to figure out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2167" target="_blank">00:36:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">what you need to learn. Yeah. Um, yeah, I would say that does feel like, um, something that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2173" target="_blank">00:36:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">missing from today's systems. I mean, I would say, um, people haven't really pushed too hard</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2181" target="_blank">00:36:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">on this middle ground between, uh, like large-scale training, like where you produce the, like this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2188" target="_blank">00:36:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">snapshot model, that's supposed to do everything like a deployed model. And then like, on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2193" target="_blank">00:36:33.280</a></span> | <span class="t">other hand, like in context learning. And I think part of that is that we've just been, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2197" target="_blank">00:36:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">increasing context length so much that there hasn't been an incentive for it. So if you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2202" target="_blank">00:36:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">go to like a hundred thousand or a million context, then that's actually quite a lot. And, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2208" target="_blank">00:36:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">it's not, um, it's not actually the bottleneck in a lot of cases, but I agree that, um, you'd</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2215" target="_blank">00:36:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">probably also want to supplement that by some kind of fine tuning, like the, uh, the capabilities you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2220" target="_blank">00:37:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">get from fine tuning and in context learning are probably somewhat complimentary. So I would expect</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2227" target="_blank">00:37:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">us to want to build systems that do some kind of online learning and also have some of these, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2233" target="_blank">00:37:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">cognitive skills of, uh, like introspecting on their own knowledge and, uh, seeking out new,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2240" target="_blank">00:37:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">new knowledge that fills in the holes.

I would say if you're doing some kind of long horizon task, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2268" target="_blank">00:37:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">well, I would, uh, you're learning while you do the task, right?

Um, so I think, um, something like, um, like motor</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2409" target="_blank">00:40:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">learning in animals is probably something like a policy grading algorithm. And, uh, so for example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2415" target="_blank">00:40:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">you're like learning how to, um, shoot baskets. Uh, I think you probably, uh, like that takes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2421" target="_blank">00:40:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, maybe thousands of tries to, um, get more accurate. And I think you probably,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2426" target="_blank">00:40:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">there's probably some, something that's, uh, like a policy grading algorithm underneath. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2432" target="_blank">00:40:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">but, uh, that's not going to be the fastest way to learn in, um, like if, if you have a model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2438" target="_blank">00:40:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">trying to do a project or some kind of task. Um, so I would think we would want to rely more on,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2444" target="_blank">00:40:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">like in context learning, um, where, uh, you effectively have a learned algorithm,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2451" target="_blank">00:40:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">like you've learned how to explore, uh, like you've learned how to try all the possibilities</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2456" target="_blank">00:40:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">exhaustively.

So, yeah, I would say we'll be able to do things that look more like learned search</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2467" target="_blank">00:41:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">algorithms and that'll be the kind of thing that, uh, gets used in a particular task.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2473" target="_blank">00:41:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Interesting. All right. I want to, uh, step back and ask about your own history. So, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2480" target="_blank">00:41:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">at least at opening. I, so, uh, you, you led a creation of tragedy at what point do you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2487" target="_blank">00:41:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">did you realize, first of all, these LLMs are the path to go. And then a chat bot would be,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2492" target="_blank">00:41:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">or some way to instruct them would be a useful thing to do. Just walk me through the whole</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2495" target="_blank">00:41:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">lineage from like, when this became the, your main focus and yeah. What, what, what, what,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2501" target="_blank">00:41:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah, what, what the process was like. Yeah. So early. Um, so we had, um, uh, before chat GBT,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2509" target="_blank">00:41:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, we had, um, open AI had these instruction following models and, uh, that was the idea there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2515" target="_blank">00:41:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">was, um, we had base models and people can prompt them in elaborate ways. Um, but, uh, they're also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2522" target="_blank">00:42:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of hard to prompt. You had to, uh, they basically do auto-complete. So you have to set</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2527" target="_blank">00:42:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">up a very good prompt with some examples. So, uh, uh, so, uh, people at open AI, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2534" target="_blank">00:42:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">we're working on, um, just taking the base models and making them easier to prompt so that if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2539" target="_blank">00:42:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">just wrote a question, it would answer the question instead of giving you more questions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2543" target="_blank">00:42:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">or something. Uh, so that was, uh, so, so we had these instruction following models, which were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2549" target="_blank">00:42:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of like base models, but a little easier to use. Um, and those are the original ones deployed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2554" target="_blank">00:42:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">in the API or after, um, GPT three, those were the next generation of models. Um, then at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2561" target="_blank">00:42:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">same time, there were definitely a lot of people thinking about, um, chat. So, uh, so Google had</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2568" target="_blank">00:42:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">some papers, uh, like they had a Lambda and, um, earlier Mina. So they had these chat bots and it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2575" target="_blank">00:42:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">was more like, um, uh, like you had a, it was more like a base model that was really specialized to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2581" target="_blank">00:43:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">um, the task of chat, really good at chat. And, uh, like, I think at least, uh, looking at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2586" target="_blank">00:43:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">examples from the paper, it was more, uh, used for sort of fun applications, like, um, where the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2592" target="_blank">00:43:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">model would, uh, like take on some persona and pretend to be that persona. It was not so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2597" target="_blank">00:43:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">functional, like, um, like help me refactor my code. Um, so yeah, there are definitely people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2604" target="_blank">00:43:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">thinking about chat. I had worked on a project before, uh, looking at chat called, uh, web GPT,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2611" target="_blank">00:43:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">which was more about doing question answering with the help of, uh, web browsing and retrieval.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2617" target="_blank">00:43:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And well, when you do question answering, uh, it really wants to be in a chat because, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2625" target="_blank">00:43:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">you always, uh, want to ask follow-up questions, or sometimes you need to clarify the model should</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2629" target="_blank">00:43:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">ask a clarifying question because the question's ambiguous. So it was kind of clear after we did</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2634" target="_blank">00:43:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">the first version of that, that we should, the next version should be conversational.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2638" target="_blank">00:43:58.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So anyway, we started working on, uh, like the conversational chat assistant. Um, and, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2646" target="_blank">00:44:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">we, uh, this was built on top of GPT 3.5, which was done training at the beginning of 2022. And,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2654" target="_blank">00:44:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, that model was quite good at language and code. So we quickly realized that it was actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2658" target="_blank">00:44:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">quite good at coding help. And that was one of the things we were excited about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2663" target="_blank">00:44:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So, yeah, we worked on that. Uh, we worked on that for, for most of the year and, uh, we had,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2670" target="_blank">00:44:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">we had browsing, um, as another feature in it, though we ended up, uh, like de-emphasizing that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2675" target="_blank">00:44:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">later on because the, like the models internal knowledge was so good that we didn't, that the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2680" target="_blank">00:44:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">browsing, um, wasn't the most interesting thing about it. Um, and then, uh, we were thinking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2686" target="_blank">00:44:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">about, we had it out for beta testing or to friends and family for a while. And, uh, we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2691" target="_blank">00:44:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">were thinking about doing a public release. Um, but, um, at that time, uh, actually GPT 4 finished</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2698" target="_blank">00:44:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">training in August or, um, yeah, in August that year. And, um, actually the, um, like the flagship</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2708" target="_blank">00:45:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">RL effort at open AI was the instruction following effort. Cause that was the models that were being</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2713" target="_blank">00:45:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">deployed into productions. So, um, like the first fine tunes of GPT 4 used that, um, that whole</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2719" target="_blank">00:45:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">stack. And that was, um, yeah, those models were really good. And everyone got really excited about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2725" target="_blank">00:45:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that after seeing the, uh, like instruct fine tune GP force. Uh, but so they were really,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2731" target="_blank">00:45:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">really good. They would occasionally give you amazing outputs, but they were also like a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2735" target="_blank">00:45:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">bit, the model was clearly like pretty unreliable. Like it would sometimes hallucinate it a lot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2740" target="_blank">00:45:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was like pretty, it would sometimes give you pretty unhinged outputs. So it was clearly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2745" target="_blank">00:45:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">not quite ready for primetime, but it was like, obviously very good. Um, and, uh, yeah, so I guess</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2752" target="_blank">00:45:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that, um, people forgot about chat for a little while after that, because about this like alternative</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2758" target="_blank">00:45:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">branch. Uh, but then we, we ended up, um, we pushed it further and we ended up like mixing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2763" target="_blank">00:46:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">together all the datasets, like the instruct and the chat data and to try to get something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2768" target="_blank">00:46:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that was the best of both worlds. And, uh, I think the, yeah, the models, we, the chat models were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2773" target="_blank">00:46:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">like, uh, were clearly more, um, like it was an easy, easier to use. It was sort of more, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2781" target="_blank">00:46:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">it sort of, uh, like automatically had much more sensible behavior in terms of like the model,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2786" target="_blank">00:46:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">knowing its own limitations. That was actually one of the things that, uh, I got excited about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2791" target="_blank">00:46:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">as we were developing it that, uh, like I realized a lot of the things that, um, people thought were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2797" target="_blank">00:46:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">flaws in language models, like just like blatantly hallucinating, uh, could be not completely fixed,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2804" target="_blank">00:46:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">but you could make a lot of progress with pretty straightforward methods. Uh, oh yeah. And also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2810" target="_blank">00:46:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the, um, the other thing about chat was that, uh, like when we had these instruct models, uh, like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2818" target="_blank">00:46:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the task of, uh, complete this text, but in a nice way or in a helpful way, that's like a pretty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2823" target="_blank">00:47:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">poorly defined task. So I think, uh, like, I think that task is like both confusing for the model and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2828" target="_blank">00:47:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">for the human who's supposed to do the data labeling. Whereas for chat, um, I think people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2833" target="_blank">00:47:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">had an intuitive sense of, uh, like what a helpful robot should be like. So I think it was, uh, just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2838" target="_blank">00:47:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">much easier to tell people, uh, like, uh, to, to give for people to get the idea of what, what the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2845" target="_blank">00:47:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">model was supposed to do. Yeah. Um, and, uh, so that, so as a result, I think the, um, like the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2851" target="_blank">00:47:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">model had a much more coherent personality and, uh, like it was much like easier to get, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2857" target="_blank">00:47:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">like robot, like pretty sensible behavior, um, robustly. Interesting. Uh, is it the case that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2864" target="_blank">00:47:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">anybody could have made chat GBT using your publicly available fine tuning API? Um, not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2872" target="_blank">00:47:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">exactly. I mean, uh, they could have, um, I don't remember the status of which models were available</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2879" target="_blank">00:47:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">available for fine tuning. Uh, you, uh, assuming we had 3.5 available for fine tuning at the time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2886" target="_blank">00:48:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">you could have made something pretty decently close, but I'm not sure you would have, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2891" target="_blank">00:48:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think you would have been able to do just one iteration of fine tuning where you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2896" target="_blank">00:48:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">have like pure, purely human written data. And you fine tune on that. I think you would want,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2900" target="_blank">00:48:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">like, you'd want to do several iterations. Like if you're not going to do RL, um, which, which we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2906" target="_blank">00:48:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">did, um, you'd want to do some kind of iterative supervised fine tuning where you have like humans</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2912" target="_blank">00:48:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">edit the model generated outputs, because it's really hard to get people to like, if you train</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2918" target="_blank">00:48:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">on human generated data, even if it's really high quality, it's just hard for a model to fit that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2923" target="_blank">00:48:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">data perfectly because it might not be like, it might not be something a model is capable of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2928" target="_blank">00:48:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">outputting. Uh, so you need to do something iterative that looks a little bit more like RL.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2935" target="_blank">00:48:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think if you had done that, you could have gotten something pretty close, but,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2939" target="_blank">00:48:59.120</a></span> | <span class="t">um, that would have been kind of non-trivial. Um, but we also had another, uh, like instruction</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2946" target="_blank">00:49:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">following model trained with RL that was released a little before ChatGBT. So I think if you put a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2951" target="_blank">00:49:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">chat, like wrapper on that, you would get something decently close. Uh, but it like that model, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2958" target="_blank">00:49:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">like if you just prompted it with chat, um, so, but that model had some, uh, differences in, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2965" target="_blank">00:49:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">strengths, like it was like that model was pretty good at writing and poetry and so forth, but it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2970" target="_blank">00:49:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">wasn't, uh, it sort of, it wasn't as good at knowing its limitations and, uh, at factuality</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2976" target="_blank">00:49:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and so forth. Um, so stepping back from 3.5, I think I heard you somewhere say GPT-2 you're super</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2983" target="_blank">00:49:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">impressed compared to your expectations in 2019. Has AI progressed faster or slower than you would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2989" target="_blank">00:49:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">have expected? I would say faster than I would have expected since GPT-2. Yeah. Um, I was pretty,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=2997" target="_blank">00:49:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">um, like bought into, um, scaling and, uh, yeah, pre-training and so forth being a good idea. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3004" target="_blank">00:50:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but, um, when GPT-2 was done, I was, I would say I wasn't completely, uh, sold on it, um, being,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3011" target="_blank">00:50:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, revolutionizing everything. Um, like I only really pivoted what I was working on and what,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3016" target="_blank">00:50:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah, what, what my team was working on in, um, after GPT-3. So after that, uh, we kind of got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3022" target="_blank">00:50:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">together and said, oh yeah, let's, uh, uh, let's, um, this language model stuff works really well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3028" target="_blank">00:50:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's see what we can do here. But, uh, yeah, after GPT-2, I wasn't quite sure yet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3033" target="_blank">00:50:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Hmm. Uh, especially if the stuff we were talking about earlier with, uh, RL starts working better</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3040" target="_blank">00:50:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">with these smarter models with a fraction of compute that is spent on training that is pre-training</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3046" target="_blank">00:50:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">versus post-training change significantly in favor of post-training in the future.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3051" target="_blank">00:50:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. There are some arguments for that. I mean, right now it's a pretty lopsided ratio, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3057" target="_blank">00:50:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">you could argue that the, uh, output generated by the model is like high quality compared to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3063" target="_blank">00:51:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">or higher quality than most of what's on the web. So, uh, it sort of makes more sense for the model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3069" target="_blank">00:51:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">to, uh, think by itself, um, instead of just, um, like training to, uh, imitate what's on the web.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3076" target="_blank">00:51:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think there's a first principles argument for that. And, um, I would say we found a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3083" target="_blank">00:51:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">of gains through post-training. So, um, I'm not sure. So I would expect us to keep, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3088" target="_blank">00:51:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">like pushing this methodology and probably increasing the amount of compute we put into it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3094" target="_blank">00:51:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Hmm. The current GPD 4 has a ELO score that is like a hundred points higher than the original</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3103" target="_blank">00:51:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">one that was released. And is that all because of what you're talking about with these improvements</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3108" target="_blank">00:51:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that are brought on by post-training or. Yeah, I would say that we've, um, I would say that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3114" target="_blank">00:51:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">most of that is post-training. Interesting. Um, so there are a lot of, um, there are a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3119" target="_blank">00:51:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">different, uh, separate axes for improvement. Like you can, uh, yeah, so it's, we think about,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3126" target="_blank">00:52:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">um, like data quality, data quantity, just doing more iterations of the whole, uh, process of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3131" target="_blank">00:52:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">deploying and collecting new data and like changing what you're, what kind of annotations</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3137" target="_blank">00:52:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">you're collecting.

Um, so yeah, so I would just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3661" target="_blank">01:01:01.440</a></span> | <span class="t">say there's like, um, the bigger model has a bigger library of different, uh, computations,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3666" target="_blank">01:01:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">including lots of stuff that's kind of dormant and only being used some of the time. Uh, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3671" target="_blank">01:01:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">those things, but it has like more space to look for the, uh, like look for the circuits to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3677" target="_blank">01:01:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">something useful.

I want to understand just sort of like modal scenario of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3690" target="_blank">01:01:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">what happens for the next few years. I think, uh, towards the beginning of the conversation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3694" target="_blank">01:01:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">we were talking about the case in which it progresses really fast, but just let's just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3699" target="_blank">01:01:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">say like the modal scenario, um, you're unlocking long horizon RL at some point, but then as you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3705" target="_blank">01:01:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">said, there's potentially other bottlenecks. So what's happening, you know, uh, how good are these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3711" target="_blank">01:01:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">models? How are they being deployed? What other modalities are part of them at what, at what stage</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3716" target="_blank">01:01:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">are these being unlocked and so forth? And just kind of want to understand your broader picture</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3719" target="_blank">01:01:59.600</a></span> | <span class="t">of what the next few years look like. Yeah, I would expect, um, I would expect things like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3726" target="_blank">01:02:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">okay, new modalities to be added, uh, like, um, over time or, uh, pretty soon. Um, I would,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3735" target="_blank">01:02:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah, I would expect the capabilities to generally keep getting better through a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3738" target="_blank">01:02:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">combination of pre-training and post-training and that'll open up new use cases. So right now, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3744" target="_blank">01:02:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">AI is still, um, not a huge, uh, part of the economy. Like there's a pretty small fraction of,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3750" target="_blank">01:02:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, jobs that it can help with at all. Um, so I expect that to be higher over time and not just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3757" target="_blank">01:02:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">from the models, uh, improving also from people just figuring out how to integrate them into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3761" target="_blank">01:02:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">different processes. So even, even if we just, um, froze the models at their current, uh, state,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3768" target="_blank">01:02:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">um, I think you would still see a lot of growth in how they're being used. Um, so I would expect</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3774" target="_blank">01:02:54.720</a></span> | <span class="t">there to be a lot of, um, like I would expect AI to be, um, used much more widely and, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3783" target="_blank">01:03:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I would expect it to be used for more, um, kind of technique, like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3789" target="_blank">01:03:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">technically sophisticated tasks.

So I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3802" target="_blank">01:03:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">would hope that, uh, we can use, um, AI to accelerate science in various ways. And, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3807" target="_blank">01:03:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">just, um, like, uh, because you can potentially have the, the models, like understand all of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3815" target="_blank">01:03:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">literature in a given field and be able to like, uh, be able to sift through tons of data, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3822" target="_blank">01:03:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">like more than a person would have patience to do. So I would hope that we can basically, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3828" target="_blank">01:03:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">like, yeah. Um, well, I hope the form factor would basically be that people are, uh, still</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3835" target="_blank">01:03:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">driving all of this and you have your, uh, like helpful assistants that you can use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3839" target="_blank">01:03:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">You can sort of direct and point to lots of different problems that are useful to you. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3844" target="_blank">01:04:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">everyone sort of has all these, uh, AIs, uh, helping them, uh, helping them do more, get more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3850" target="_blank">01:04:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">done. Hey, everybody real quick. I want to tell you about a tool that I wish more applications</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3856" target="_blank">01:04:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">used. So obviously you've noticed every single company is trying to add an AI chat bot to their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3862" target="_blank">01:04:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">website, but as a user, I usually find them really annoying because they have these long, generic,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3868" target="_blank">01:04:28.560</a></span> | <span class="t">often useless answers.

And it feels like you're talking to a friendly human support agent who is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3879" target="_blank">01:04:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">browsing with you and for you. And it's much more personalized than a regular chat bot. It can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3886" target="_blank">01:04:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">actually look up users' history and respond differently based on that. It can use APIs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3891" target="_blank">01:04:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">to perform actions. It can even practically nudge users to explore new features. One thing that I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3897" target="_blank">01:04:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">think is really cool is that instead of just outputting text, command bar can kind of just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3902" target="_blank">01:05:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">say here, let me show you and start browsing alongside the user. Anyways, they're in a bunch</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3908" target="_blank">01:05:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">of great products already. You can learn more about them at commandbar.com. Thanks to them for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3914" target="_blank">01:05:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">sponsoring this episode. But obviously at some point, they're going to be better than everyone,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3920" target="_blank">01:05:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">whatever they want to do. So what would that process look like? Right now, they're clearly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3926" target="_blank">01:05:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">only helping you. At some point, they're able to just do things for you and maybe run entire</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3931" target="_blank">01:05:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">firms for you or whatever. At that point, is it just going to be a smooth process? And at that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3939" target="_blank">01:05:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">point, the hope is that we have systems that are aligned with the user enough that they can count</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3945" target="_blank">01:05:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">on the firm being run in the way they expect and so forth? Yeah, I think, well, we might not want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3952" target="_blank">01:05:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to jump to having AIs run whole firms immediately. I mean, we might want to have people overseeing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3963" target="_blank">01:06:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">these important decisions and calling the shots, even if the models are good enough to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3969" target="_blank">01:06:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">actually run a successful business themselves. So yeah, to some extent, there might be choices</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3979" target="_blank">01:06:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">there. And I think people will still have different interests and different ideas for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=3987" target="_blank">01:06:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">what kind of interesting pursuits they want to direct their AIs at. AI doesn't necessarily have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4001" target="_blank">01:06:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">any kind of intrinsic desire of its own unless we put it in the system. So people can still end up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4012" target="_blank">01:06:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">being -- even if AIs become extremely capable, I would hope that people are still the drivers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4019" target="_blank">01:06:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">of what the AIs end up doing. Yeah. But I wonder if the economic equilibrium is so far from that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4027" target="_blank">01:07:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">where you have the equivalent of Amdahl's law in a firm. The slowest part of the process is the one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4034" target="_blank">01:07:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">that's going to bottleneck you. And so the AI makes all the non-human parts of the firm 10x</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4039" target="_blank">01:07:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">more efficient. It's still bottlenecked by that step. And so if one company decides to proceed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4048" target="_blank">01:07:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">by keeping humans in the loop on all the things that you really want human oversight on, then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4053" target="_blank">01:07:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">they'll just be out-competed by other companies. If one country decides to go this route, other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4056" target="_blank">01:07:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">countries will beat it. I wonder if this is a sustainable plan for keeping humans in the loop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4066" target="_blank">01:07:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. So I think if we wanted to keep humans in the loop, which seems reasonable,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4073" target="_blank">01:07:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">and it turned out that firms with any humans in the loop were out-competed by firms that didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4080" target="_blank">01:08:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">have any humans, then I think you would obviously need some kind of regulation that disallowed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4088" target="_blank">01:08:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">having no humans in the loop for running a whole company. But there's so many companies</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4095" target="_blank">01:08:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I guess in any country, let alone the world. I wonder if it's better to do the regulation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4102" target="_blank">01:08:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">on companies and say, "You've got to keep humans in the loop on important processes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4106" target="_blank">01:08:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">but then you have to define what important processes are. You've got to monitor every</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4109" target="_blank">01:08:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">single company. And you also got to get collaboration in every single country,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4114" target="_blank">01:08:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">which has firms in it." Versus if this is a problem, should it be solved before the model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4120" target="_blank">01:08:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">is even deployed, such that hopefully you would get into a situation where you did decide to build</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4126" target="_blank">01:08:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">a firm end-to-end on these models. It basically does what you want it to do, and you don't need a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4132" target="_blank">01:08:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">human in the loop. Does that question make sense? I guess I'm just wondering in this situation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4136" target="_blank">01:08:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">how do we actually monitor every single firm as a human in the loop? And what happens if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4140" target="_blank">01:09:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">China doesn't decide to do that and so forth? Right. Yeah, you would either have to have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4147" target="_blank">01:09:07.600</a></span> | <span class="t">every country agree to this regulatory regime, or you would need all of the model infrastructure or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4155" target="_blank">01:09:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the model providers to agree to this kind of requirement. So it's definitely going to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4162" target="_blank">01:09:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">non-trivial. So I guess, yeah, this is looking at ways ahead. So it's a little hard to imagine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4173" target="_blank">01:09:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">this world before seeing anything like it. So for example, there's some questions like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4183" target="_blank">01:09:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">are we actually confident that AI-run companies are better in every way? Or do we think they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4192" target="_blank">01:09:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">better most of the time, but occasionally they malfunction because AIs are still less sample</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4198" target="_blank">01:09:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">efficient in certain ways, like dealing with very wacky situations. So actually, AI-run firms have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4206" target="_blank">01:10:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">higher tail risk because they're more likely to malfunction in a big way. So I guess there might</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4211" target="_blank">01:10:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">be some practical questions like that that would also determine how things play out. Maybe if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4219" target="_blank">01:10:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">just require people to be accountable for various liability, this would also change the incentives a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4225" target="_blank">01:10:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">bit. So if it turned out that AIs are better at running everything, and they're also completely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4232" target="_blank">01:10:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">benevolent, and we've totally solved alignment, and they're better at being accountable to people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4243" target="_blank">01:10:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">than people are, then I would say maybe it's OK having the AIs run the firms. But I think that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4250" target="_blank">01:10:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">might be pretty far out. And I think we're more likely to be in a situation where they look better</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4255" target="_blank">01:10:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">in the short term, but the AI-run entities still have some serious problems. And it's actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4264" target="_blank">01:11:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">practical considerations that push you more towards having humans in the loop,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4267" target="_blank">01:11:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">at least for the near future. OK, so this is a problem we had to deal with today with RLHF,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4272" target="_blank">01:11:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">where you have to aggregate preferences across a lot of different humans.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4277" target="_blank">01:11:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And it'll be maybe more marked with future, more powerful systems. But when you say, "Well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4283" target="_blank">01:11:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">we want these eventual AI systems that are going to fully replace humans as part of these firms to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4288" target="_blank">01:11:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">be aligned," what does that mean? Will it mean that they basically do what the user wants them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4293" target="_blank">01:11:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to do? Does it mean that they have to result in some sort of global outcome that we're happy with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4301" target="_blank">01:11:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">as the kind of people, the stakeholders in OpenAI? What concretely would that mean?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4306" target="_blank">01:11:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">If the models are being used for these higher stakes use cases, then we would have to think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4315" target="_blank">01:11:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">about RLHF in a much different way than we are right now. So I would say we're not quite ready</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4323" target="_blank">01:12:03.520</a></span> | <span class="t">for that, or the current methods might not be completely sufficient. But I would say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4329" target="_blank">01:12:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">we would need to make compromises between the needs of the different stakeholders involved.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4337" target="_blank">01:12:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have this document that we're releasing called the Model Spec. And it's about how we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4346" target="_blank">01:12:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">want our models to behave in the API and in ChatGBT. And we try to talk about this issue,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4354" target="_blank">01:12:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">where there are different stakeholders involved, and sometimes there are conflicts between what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4358" target="_blank">01:12:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">they might want. In our case, we were thinking of the stakeholders as the end user. That means</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4369" target="_blank">01:12:49.520</a></span> | <span class="t">someone sitting in front of ChatGBT or some other app. The developer. So this is someone using the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4377" target="_blank">01:12:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">API who might be serving other end users with their app. The platform, which is OpenAI. We</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4387" target="_blank">01:13:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">don't want the models to expose us to legal risk and so forth. And then the rest of humanity,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4395" target="_blank">01:13:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">including people who might not be users or customers or anything. So obviously,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4403" target="_blank">01:13:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the user might ask the model to do something that we think is actively harmful to other people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4412" target="_blank">01:13:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we might have to refuse that. By the way, this isn't the order of priority necessarily.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4419" target="_blank">01:13:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have these four or so classes of stakeholders. Actually, you could also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4425" target="_blank">01:13:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">say maybe in the future we'll say the model itself, though I would say we're not going there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4430" target="_blank">01:13:50.560</a></span> | <span class="t">yet. But anyway, we have these different stakeholders. Sometimes they have conflicting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4438" target="_blank">01:13:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">demands, and we have to make some call on how to resolve those conflicts. And it's not always</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4444" target="_blank">01:14:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">obvious how to do that. So I would say we had to think through. Yeah, we just had to think through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4452" target="_blank">01:14:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the tradeoffs. And basically the rough heuristic is that we mostly want the models to follow your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4460" target="_blank">01:14:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">instructions and be helpful to the user and the developer. But when this impinges on other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4470" target="_blank">01:14:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">people's happiness or way of life, this becomes a problem. And we have to block certain kinds of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4477" target="_blank">01:14:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">usage. But we mostly want the models to just be an extension of people's will and do what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4484" target="_blank">01:14:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">they say. We don't want to be too paternalistic. We want to be kind of neutral and not impose</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4490" target="_blank">01:14:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">our opinions on people. Yeah, we want to mostly let people do what they want with the models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4500" target="_blank">01:15:00.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I got a chance to read the spec beforehand, and it was, I guess, a question of how well that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4507" target="_blank">01:15:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">transfers over to how the model itself behaves. But I was impressed with how sensible the tradeoffs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4514" target="_blank">01:15:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">were. It made sense that this is the, I believe it was exclusively stated the actual edge cases</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4520" target="_blank">01:15:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">rather than the kinds of things where everybody can, which are obvious. In this case, you really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4524" target="_blank">01:15:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">are going after the edge cases. Yeah, we wanted it to be very actionable so that it wasn't just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4529" target="_blank">01:15:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">a bunch of nice sounding principles. But it was like each example kind of tells you something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4534" target="_blank">01:15:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">about some non-obvious situation and reasons through that situation. Yeah. Okay. Now I have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4540" target="_blank">01:15:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">a couple of questions about the state of the research itself. So famously in the social</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4547" target="_blank">01:15:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">sciences, things are really hard to replicate. And it's a question about how much of the science</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4551" target="_blank">01:15:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">there is real versus these manufactured bespoke sorts of experiments. When you look at the average</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4560" target="_blank">01:16:00.160</a></span> | <span class="t">ML paper, does it feel like the, like a really solid piece of literature, or does it feel often</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4566" target="_blank">01:16:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">like it's the equivalent of what P hacking is in the social sciences? Everyone has their complaints</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4572" target="_blank">01:16:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">about the ML literature, but I would say overall, I think it's a relatively healthy field compared to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4580" target="_blank">01:16:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">some other ones like in the social sciences. Just because, well, it's grounded, it's largely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4588" target="_blank">01:16:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">grounded in practicality and getting things to work. And if you publish something that can't be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4597" target="_blank">01:16:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">replicated easily, then people will just forget about it. And it's like accepted that often you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4603" target="_blank">01:16:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">don't just report someone's number from their paper. You also try to re-implement their method</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4609" target="_blank">01:16:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and compare it to your method on the same training data set. So I think if you publish methods that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4616" target="_blank">01:16:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">are really hard to implement or are really finicky, they'll tend to get forgotten. And as a result,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4624" target="_blank">01:17:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">people actually try to open source their work a lot. I guess there's various unfavorable incentives</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4636" target="_blank">01:17:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">like, yeah, people are incentivized to make the baseline methods, like the methods they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4642" target="_blank">01:17:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">comparing to worse. And there are other mild pathologies, like trying to make your methods</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4649" target="_blank">01:17:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">seem sophisticated mathematically. But I would say overall, I feel like the field makes progress.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4656" target="_blank">01:17:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And I would probably like to see a little bit more science and trying to understand things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4662" target="_blank">01:17:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">rather than more like hill climbing on benchmarks and trying to propose new methods. And there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4670" target="_blank">01:17:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">been a decent amount of that recently. But yeah, I think we could use more of that. And I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4676" target="_blank">01:17:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">that's a good thing for academics to work on. Oh yeah, on the social sciences, on a slightly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4684" target="_blank">01:18:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">different note, I think actually I'd be really excited to see more research on using base models</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4693" target="_blank">01:18:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">to do simulated social science. Because these models have a probabilistic model of the whole</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4700" target="_blank">01:18:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">world. And you can set up a simulated questionnaire or a conversation. And you can look at how anything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4711" target="_blank">01:18:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">is correlated, like any traits that you might imagine, you can see how they might be correlated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo95ob_s_NI&t=4717" target="_blank">01:18:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">with other traits.
