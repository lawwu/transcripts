Number one, pray that God would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=734RjrDRPwc&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">help you, that he would fight your doubts and cynicism with you and for you. In other words,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=734RjrDRPwc&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">cry out to God, "Fight for me. Help me defeat these obstacles." And we all know where that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=734RjrDRPwc&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">coming from. Mark 9 24, immediately the father of the child who had this epileptic fit that nobody</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=734RjrDRPwc&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">could heal, and he said, "Do you want me to do anything here?" And the man said, "If you can."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=734RjrDRPwc&t=155" target="_blank">00:02:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And she said, "What is 'if' stuff?" And then the man cried out, "I believe. Help my unbelief."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=734RjrDRPwc&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's a strange way to say it. Help your unbelief do what? Like, die, that's what. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=734RjrDRPwc&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">which means that Kristen and I need to preface our Bible reading every day with prayer, "God,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=734RjrDRPwc&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">help me with my unbelief." That is, kill it, destroy it, get at whatever's causing it. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=734RjrDRPwc&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">prayer. Number two, seek in all your reading and praying in the Bible, not just to know truth,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=734RjrDRPwc&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">but to see the glory of Christ. There is a spiritual light shining from Christ that is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=734RjrDRPwc&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">self-authenticating if you saw it. And I'm thinking here now of the doubting Thomas. I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=734RjrDRPwc&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">glad he exists and is in the Bible for Kristen and me. Then Jesus said to Thomas, remember,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=734RjrDRPwc&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Thomas said, "I'm not going to believe unless I have my finger in his side." And so, Jesus showing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=734RjrDRPwc&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">up, and he says, "Put your finger here and see my hands, and put out your hand and place it in my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=734RjrDRPwc&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">side. Do not disbelieve, but believe." Thomas answered him, "My Lord and my God." In other words,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=734RjrDRPwc&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">he did not touch him. He saw him. Something happened when he saw him. He thought that he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=734RjrDRPwc&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">would need to do more. He would need more evidence for a ghost, you know, "He's going to be a ghost.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=734RjrDRPwc&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to be tricked." And when Jesus showed up, he didn't need any more. He didn't. He didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=734RjrDRPwc&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">have to push it to the limit of his evidential demands. And Jesus said, "Have you believed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=734RjrDRPwc&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet believed." And I think that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=734RjrDRPwc&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">means not seeing the way you've seen, but believed by the seeing that comes through the Word. And so,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=734RjrDRPwc&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm saying to Kristen that when she reads, "Ask the Lord for this," this kind of, not physical,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=734RjrDRPwc&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">but a spiritual discernment, a spiritual sight of Christ that is different than a kind of argument</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=734RjrDRPwc&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">from evidences drawn with inferences. So number three, "Think much about the patience and mercy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=734RjrDRPwc&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">of God to doubters." Peter said, "Lord, if it's you, command me to come to you on the water."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=734RjrDRPwc&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">He's going to walk on water. And Jesus said, "Come." So Peter got out of the boat,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=734RjrDRPwc&t=328" target="_blank">00:05:28.560</a></span> | <span class="t">walked on the water, and came to Jesus, and then it says—this is Matthew 14, 30—but when he saw the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=734RjrDRPwc&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">wind, he was afraid and beginning to sink, he cried out, "Lord, save me!" And Jesus did not say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=734RjrDRPwc&t=345" target="_blank">00:05:45.920</a></span> | <span class="t">"Tough, man! I don't want—what a jerk! I just told you you could do this, and you were doing it!"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=734RjrDRPwc&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">No, no, that is not what Jesus said or did. Jesus immediately reached out his hand and took</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=734RjrDRPwc&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">hold of him, saying, "Oh, you of little faith, why did you doubt?" So meditate on the kindness</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=734RjrDRPwc&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and the patience of Jesus to doubters. So Peter's doubting, and Jesus reaches out his hand. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=734RjrDRPwc&t=377" target="_blank">00:06:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe that's what Kirsten would feel as she reads this. "He is reaching out his hand to me in my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=734RjrDRPwc&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">doubt." Number four, seek out people of strong faith to read outside the Bible and to be around</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=734RjrDRPwc&t=392" target="_blank">00:06:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">in person and make them your heroes. So Hebrews 13, 7, "Remember your leaders, those who spoke</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=734RjrDRPwc&t=400" target="_blank">00:06:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to you the Word of God. Consider the outcome of their way of life. Imitate their faith."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=734RjrDRPwc&t=404" target="_blank">00:06:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever, so he explicitly wants us to look to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=734RjrDRPwc&t=413" target="_blank">00:06:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">people who are ahead of us in this battle of faith, and take heart from looking at the outcome</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=734RjrDRPwc&t=421" target="_blank">00:07:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">of their faith. And here's another one in Hebrews. Hebrews seems to be really big on this communal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=734RjrDRPwc&t=427" target="_blank">00:07:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">nature of fighting the fight of faith. So Hebrews 3, 12, "Take care, brothers, lest there be in any</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=734RjrDRPwc&t=433" target="_blank">00:07:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">of you an evil, unbelieving," you could say, "doubting heart, leading you to fall away from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=734RjrDRPwc&t=438" target="_blank">00:07:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the living God. Exhort one another every day, as long as it is called today, that none of you may</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=734RjrDRPwc&t=444" target="_blank">00:07:24.240</a></span> | <span class="t">be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin." In other words, we need to be in groups where people fight</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=734RjrDRPwc&t=450" target="_blank">00:07:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">with us and help us and direct us to things that will give strength to our faith rather than weaken</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=734RjrDRPwc&t=457" target="_blank">00:07:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">them. Number five, remember that the body has many members, and some are scholars, who have thought</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=734RjrDRPwc&t=466" target="_blank">00:07:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">long and hard about things that puzzle you and have solved many of them. So 1 Corinthians 12, 21,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=734RjrDRPwc&t=475" target="_blank">00:07:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">"The head cannot say to the feet, 'I have no need of you,' and vice versa." And it may be that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=734RjrDRPwc&t=483" target="_blank">00:08:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">sometimes those of us who are doing footwork at any given time might need to remember, "Here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=734RjrDRPwc&t=491" target="_blank">00:08:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">there's some heads, and don't let this conflict with Jesus as they head." That's what he says</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=734RjrDRPwc&t=496" target="_blank">00:08:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">here in 1 Corinthians 12, 21. Some are heads and some are feet, and the feet should never say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=734RjrDRPwc&t=502" target="_blank">00:08:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">"I don't need you, head," when the head has spent 10 years solving the problem you're just stumbling</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=734RjrDRPwc&t=507" target="_blank">00:08:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">over.
