Anecdotally, this seems to be true, but does the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=10" target="_blank">00:00:10.740</a></span> | <span class="t">data back it up? Well, it does. If you look at survey data of knowledge workers, this trend seems</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=16" target="_blank">00:00:16.280</a></span> | <span class="t">to be clear. For example, 2025 research by research consultants at Censuswide found that 66% of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=23" target="_blank">00:00:23.900</a></span> | <span class="t">American employees are experiencing some sort of burnout. This was the highest number they had</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=28" target="_blank">00:00:28.060</a></span> | <span class="t">recorded. Another survey from 2025 found that 82% of respondents reported experiencing some level of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=35" target="_blank">00:00:35.300</a></span> | <span class="t">exhaustion. I kept finding study after study along these lines. They are common and the trend lines are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=40" target="_blank">00:00:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">heading in the wrong direction. So I want to talk about this today and I have two goals. First, I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=45" target="_blank">00:00:45.400</a></span> | <span class="t">going to focus on a specific factor that I think helps explains this trend. It's not the only factor</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=51" target="_blank">00:00:51.400</a></span> | <span class="t">that explains this trend, but it is an important one. And it's one I think that we don't talk about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=55" target="_blank">00:00:55.460</a></span> | <span class="t">enough. Second, I'm going to then follow the logic. If this factor is true, where would that lead us in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=63" target="_blank">00:01:03.980</a></span> | <span class="t">terms of how we should be rethinking work? And I'm going to make a suggestion about what I think the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=68" target="_blank">00:01:08.500</a></span> | <span class="t">ideal knowledge work workday should look like for a normal human being. It's an answer that might be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=74" target="_blank">00:01:14.040</a></span> | <span class="t">shocking, but if you give it some time, I think it actually makes more sense than you might at first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=78" target="_blank">00:01:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">realize. So to get started, I want to start in an unexpected place. It's a quote I came across</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=86" target="_blank">00:01:26.340</a></span> | <span class="t">recently that sparked the whole line of thinking that led to this deep dive. It was a quote that was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=93" target="_blank">00:01:33.860</a></span> | <span class="t">written down in a journal 150 years ago, and it might not seem to have anything to do with work,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=99" target="_blank">00:01:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">but I think when we look at it closely, it has everything to do with work today. All right,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=104" target="_blank">00:01:44.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to pull this quote up here on the screen for those who are watching instead of just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=109" target="_blank">00:01:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">listening. This quote comes from Henry David Thoreau's journal. He wrote this journal entry in 1852.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=114" target="_blank">00:01:54.820</a></span> | <span class="t">This was in the period after he had already spent his time at Walden Pond, but before he had published</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">his book on the experience. So he was sort of processing it. Here's what he wrote.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I have the habit of attention to such excess that my senses get no rest, but suffer from a constant</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">strain. Be not preoccupied with looking, go not to the object, let it come to you. What I need is not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.440</a></span> | <span class="t">to look at all, but a true sauntering of the eye. Okay, let's think about this a little bit. What did he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.200</a></span> | <span class="t">mean by this? Well, to get some analysis that's going to help us connect us to work, I'm going to turn to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=155" target="_blank">00:02:35.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the source where I found this journal entry, which was in Caleb Smith's recent book, Thoreau's Axe,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.220</a></span> | <span class="t">which I read a couple months ago and we talked about on this show. The author of this book,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Caleb Smith, in analyzing Thoreau's journal entry that I just read, said the following.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">At Walden, Thoreau had begun by trying to undistract himself, to reawaken his own powers of perception and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">refocus his attention on natural, uncommodified objects of contemplation. By doing so, he had hoped to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">free himself from the degrading cycle of labor and consumption that organized middle-class life under</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">market capitalism. In the long run, though, he found that this very effort exhausted his senses and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.240</a></span> | <span class="t">trapped him in a, quote, habit of attention, end quote. All right, this is a little bit academic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">That's from an academic book, but let me deconstruct it because there's a critical point in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.900</a></span> | <span class="t">here. When Thoreau went to Walden Pond to do that experiment of living deliberately by the water,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.420</a></span> | <span class="t">he thought that his problem was he was paying attention to the wrong things,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.640</a></span> | <span class="t">right? That he was focusing too much on consumer and materialistic goods, and that by removing those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.520</a></span> | <span class="t">from his life and focusing on the wonders of nature, for example, which he describes in sort of great</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.780</a></span> | <span class="t">loving detail in his book, Walden, that he would find a sort of more purity in his existence. He was sort</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.260</a></span> | <span class="t">of playing here with the ancient monastic Christian notion of turning your attention from the worldly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.660</a></span> | <span class="t">to the heavens above and contemplating hard, you know, God and divinity. But in this journal entry</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that comes after he leaves Walden, he's realizing that the bigger problem was how much time he was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.780</a></span> | <span class="t">spending paying attention in the first place. So he was discovering this idea of, like, I need to focus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.660</a></span> | <span class="t">really hard on the right thing, like, focus on the ice that I'm going to write about in Walden,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.660</a></span> | <span class="t">focus on the clouds up above, that that act of paying so much attention itself was unnatural,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">regardless of what he was paying attention to. There's periods where you just need to let the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.780</a></span> | <span class="t">world be around you, let objects come to your attention, and then drift off. This might give you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.980</a></span> | <span class="t">deep insight. Sometimes it might not, but it gives you a more deeper sense of contentment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So we had this revelation. There's only so much we can kind of force ourselves to pay attention. We're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.780</a></span> | <span class="t">actually wired to let the world come to us, just to be there in the world for a lot of our time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.360</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, let's connect this to knowledge work. There is a through line here. In his philosophizing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.900</a></span> | <span class="t">right, Thoreau was stumbling on this important point about paying focus attention being to some degree</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.420</a></span> | <span class="t">unnatural or something we can only do a limited amount. And yet, isn't this exactly what knowledge</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.340</a></span> | <span class="t">work demands of us? The knowledge work demands that we have to be focusing and paying attention on things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.040</a></span> | <span class="t">with our brain the entire day. Well, where did this come from? Well, here's a story to tell.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.980</a></span> | <span class="t">As we get the rise of the Industrial Revolution and factory labor, we invented a new model of productive work</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.860</a></span> | <span class="t">in which what you're essentially doing is renting your body to a factory owner. So in industrial work,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">which was what was big in the time when Thoreau was around, this was the model we had. Hey, I'm going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">to rent my body to you, the factory owner, for eight hours. It would have been more before, but after,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=357" target="_blank">00:05:57.780</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, federal labor reform standards, early 20th century, it'd be something like eight hours.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=361" target="_blank">00:06:01.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you could basically tell me what to do with that. I need your arms to turn these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.060</a></span> | <span class="t">knobs and to attach these steering wheels or to move these things from the assembly line and off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=371" target="_blank">00:06:11.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And you're paying me for use of my body. You're going to tell me exactly how to use it. And if I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">say, hey, I'm going to go take a two-hour break, like, great, we're not using your body, then we're not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.520</a></span> | <span class="t">paying you for those two hours, right?

The way I think about accountability support tools, like where you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=2156" target="_blank">00:35:56.500</a></span> | <span class="t">there's different things here.

And if you don't actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=2163" target="_blank">00:36:03.380</a></span> | <span class="t">like follow through on something, you have to pay the money or, or whatever it is you're doing. I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=2167" target="_blank">00:36:07.220</a></span> | <span class="t">that's like a perfectly fine, I would call it discipline training tool. And I think it's similar</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=2174" target="_blank">00:36:14.660</a></span> | <span class="t">to various training tools you might use as you're like trying to pick up a new, you know, physical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=2179" target="_blank">00:36:19.940</a></span> | <span class="t">ability or new marker of strength. Typically what happens is people don't need to stick with these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=2185" target="_blank">00:36:25.700</a></span> | <span class="t">long-term, but they help you build up a rhythm or habit of discipline. Because of the accountability,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=2192" target="_blank">00:36:32.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I actually do this thing when I otherwise might've tried to make an excuse. And then after a while,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=2195" target="_blank">00:36:35.700</a></span> | <span class="t">that muscle gets stronger and I don't need so much support to do it, I'm now more able or willing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=2200" target="_blank">00:36:40.260</a></span> | <span class="t">to do it on my own, which is sort of where you want to end up. But accountability tools are a great way</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=2204" target="_blank">00:36:44.340</a></span> | <span class="t">to sort of break the ice on getting used to doing disciplined activity. Um, other things that matter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=2208" target="_blank">00:36:48.820</a></span> | <span class="t">also include like making sure you understand what you're doing and your brain, trust your plan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=2212" target="_blank">00:36:52.980</a></span> | <span class="t">The efforts I'm going to do will likely get me to this goal. Also really trying to load up and make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=2219" target="_blank">00:36:59.060</a></span> | <span class="t">clear in your mind the achievement of that goal. So that's very vivid. That also helps you summon</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=2223" target="_blank">00:37:03.460</a></span> | <span class="t">a discipline. And then laddering up is important as well that you have a level of discipline required.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=2230" target="_blank">00:37:10.660</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a little bit beyond where you're comfortable, but not way beyond you want to ladder that up a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=2235" target="_blank">00:37:15.060</a></span> | <span class="t">little bit more slowly because your brain has to get used to different levels of hardship that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=2239" target="_blank">00:37:19.860</a></span> | <span class="t">overcome experiences of reward that makes this type of effort worth it, et cetera. So you want to kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=2245" target="_blank">00:37:25.780</a></span> | <span class="t">of go slow.

So yeah, use the accountability tools, use whatever you need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=2252" target="_blank">00:37:32.900</a></span> | <span class="t">to help you train discipline. But this bigger picture ideas, think about discipline as something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=2258" target="_blank">00:37:38.340</a></span> | <span class="t">you train and cultivate. And then once you have it, it's a fuel for everything else. So it's not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=2262" target="_blank">00:37:42.660</a></span> | <span class="t">cheating. It's training.

The setup to this article is this idea that we have a lot of these powerful chatbots today in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=3105" target="_blank">00:51:45.300</a></span> | <span class="t">various contexts.

And emails about that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=3148" target="_blank">00:52:28.820</a></span> | <span class="t">engineer having an extramarital affair.

There's also a lot of issues we have with, you know, "Hey, you put out a chatbot just to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=3168" target="_blank">00:52:48.180</a></span> | <span class="t">like a customer service agent."

As I argue</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=3215" target="_blank">00:53:35.380</a></span> | <span class="t">early in the article, those short stories were a big divergence from how people had been writing about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=3222" target="_blank">00:53:42.500</a></span> | <span class="t">robots for the 20 years before. The term "robot" was introduced in 1921 play.

And you get to Isaac Asimov and like, there's no</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=3247" target="_blank">00:54:07.860</a></span> | <span class="t">plot lines about the robots overthrowing humanity or being violent because he has this, this contrivance</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=3253" target="_blank">00:54:13.220</a></span> | <span class="t">of the three laws of robotics. Like robots can't harm people. They'll follow directions unless it violates the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=3257" target="_blank">00:54:17.700</a></span> | <span class="t">first and second role and they will preserve themselves unless it violates the first and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=3261" target="_blank">00:54:21.300</a></span> | <span class="t">second role. And it just takes violence and mayhem off the table in his stories. And so the piece was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=3267" target="_blank">00:54:27.220</a></span> | <span class="t">like, great. So can't we just have those type of laws? You know, the same equivalent of that. So people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=3273" target="_blank">00:54:33.300</a></span> | <span class="t">aren't, they trust like these chatbots aren't going to go off the rails or whatever.

Not exactly, but it's, it's, it's ultimately humans</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=3302" target="_blank">00:55:02.580</a></span> | <span class="t">implicitly creating preferences that get captured and approximated in a reward model that gets</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=3307" target="_blank">00:55:07.780</a></span> | <span class="t">integrated into the large language model design. If you squint your eyes, basically what we're doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=3312" target="_blank">00:55:12.180</a></span> | <span class="t">is encoding a lot of rules about what's good and bad into the chatbots. And it makes it a lot better,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=3318" target="_blank">00:55:18.500</a></span> | <span class="t">but it doesn't stop all these ethical anomalies. The second twist in the article is, hey, we shouldn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=3323" target="_blank">00:55:23.380</a></span> | <span class="t">be surprised because if you keep reading the iRobot stories, it doesn't get rid of ethical anomalies</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=3329" target="_blank">00:55:29.220</a></span> | <span class="t">there either. Yes, Asimov's robots don't turn on their creators or try to destroy humanity,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=3334" target="_blank">00:55:34.020</a></span> | <span class="t">but all of those stories are about all of these unexpected, weird, and deeply unsettling quarter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=3338" target="_blank">00:55:38.420</a></span> | <span class="t">cases and ambiguities that occur at the, the boundaries of these laws, that these like simple laws don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=3345" target="_blank">00:55:45.140</a></span> | <span class="t">simply make the robots behave like, like a very well-behaved person. All this sort of weird stuff happens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=3351" target="_blank">00:55:51.300</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll read from the article here just to show you like how unsettling things got in these iRobot stories.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=3358" target="_blank">00:55:58.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So here's, here's from one of the stories, um, that shows how you can still have the laws,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=3363" target="_blank">00:56:03.140</a></span> | <span class="t">but still have things get weird. All right. So in Asimov's story's reason,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=3367" target="_blank">00:56:07.620</a></span> | <span class="t">engineers are stationed on a solar station that beams the sun's energy to a receiver on earth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=3373" target="_blank">00:56:13.460</a></span> | <span class="t">There they discover that their new advanced reasoning robot QT-1, who they call QT, does not believe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=3379" target="_blank">00:56:19.220</a></span> | <span class="t">that it was created by humans, which QT calls inferior creatures with poor reasoning faculties.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=3385" target="_blank">00:56:25.380</a></span> | <span class="t">QT concludes that the station's energy converter is a sort of God and the true source of authority,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=3391" target="_blank">00:56:31.060</a></span> | <span class="t">which enables the robot to ignore commands from the engineers without violating the second law.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=3395" target="_blank">00:56:35.780</a></span> | <span class="t">In one particularly disturbing scene, one of the engineers enters the engine room,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=3399" target="_blank">00:56:39.220</a></span> | <span class="t">where a structure called an L tube directs the captured solar energy and reacts with shock.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=3403" target="_blank">00:56:43.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So quote,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=3405" target="_blank">00:56:45.060</a></span> | <span class="t">"The robots, dwarfed by the mighty L tube, lined up before it, heads bowed at a stiff angle,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=3411" target="_blank">00:56:51.380</a></span> | <span class="t">while QT walked up and down the line slowly," Asimov writes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=3414" target="_blank">00:56:54.420</a></span> | <span class="t">"15 seconds passed.

So like the world was pretty unsettling in Asimov too. He's like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=3424" target="_blank">00:57:04.740</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah, you can have these like stark rules, but human ethics is complicated. And at the margins of these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=3433" target="_blank">00:57:13.700</a></span> | <span class="t">rules, weird, unsettling, troubling things are still going to happen. And what I argue is that Asimov was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=3438" target="_blank">00:57:18.020</a></span> | <span class="t">actually making a really clear point. He's like, I think we could stop AIs from taking over the world,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=3443" target="_blank">00:57:23.540</a></span> | <span class="t">but keep in mind, it is much easier to develop human-like capabilities and intellect than it is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=3451" target="_blank">00:57:31.700</a></span> | <span class="t">to develop human-like ethics. Human-like ethics is like a very complicated thing. What goes into the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=3456" target="_blank">00:57:36.980</a></span> | <span class="t">way that allows a customer service rep who's on a phone to know not to start randomly cursing or writing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=3464" target="_blank">00:57:44.100</a></span> | <span class="t">mean disparaging poems about their company. Like what goes into that is actually something that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=3469" target="_blank">00:57:49.940</a></span> | <span class="t">happened over thousands of years of cultural evolution and personal experience and trial and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=3473" target="_blank">00:57:53.780</a></span> | <span class="t">error and ritual and story and inner social connection. It's a messy participatory, very human</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=3478" target="_blank">00:57:58.900</a></span> | <span class="t">experience. So we can make machines sound a lot like humans and do a lot of human type stuff</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=3483" target="_blank">00:58:03.940</a></span> | <span class="t">well before we can build machines that actually know how to really act like an ethical human. And in that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=3488" target="_blank">00:58:08.980</a></span> | <span class="t">gap, a lot of unsettling stuff's going to happen. That's what was true in iRobot and that's what we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=3494" target="_blank">00:58:14.580</a></span> | <span class="t">seeing today. And it's something that we actually have to be ready for and willing to. It is, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=3500" target="_blank">00:58:20.660</a></span> | <span class="t">the more we anthropomorphize these type of AI tools as like another type of human, but just in a machine,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6POxM4lckms&t=3505" target="_blank">00:58:25.300</a></span> | <span class="t">the more we're going to be creeped out and the more unsettling things are going to happen.
