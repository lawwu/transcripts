target="_blank">00:00:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, many of you know I love to read books, so much so that I wrote a whole book about reading books.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llkuc44yRE&t=10" target="_blank">00:00:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm always encouraged to hear from readers who have put new emphasis on the priority of book reading in their own lives because of the book that I wrote.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llkuc44yRE&t=18" target="_blank">00:00:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a powerful discipline in the Christian life, as you know, Pastor John.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llkuc44yRE&t=23" target="_blank">00:00:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm reminded of an episode we did this spring about how 1% of a book can change your life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llkuc44yRE&t=28" target="_blank">00:00:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That was the title, "1% of a Book Can Change Your Life," the title of APJ 1910.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llkuc44yRE&t=34" target="_blank">00:00:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Books have played a huge role in your development, and I know this, Pastor John, because every once in a while I get to study a book from your library.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llkuc44yRE&t=42" target="_blank">00:00:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I get to borrow it and take a peek at how you marked it up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llkuc44yRE&t=45" target="_blank">00:00:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Most recently, I looked through your copy of Mortimer Adler's classic, "How to Read a Book," because I was working on another project in the works,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llkuc44yRE&t=52" target="_blank">00:00:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">actually a book about this podcast, actually, but it's getting too complex with books.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llkuc44yRE&t=57" target="_blank">00:00:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We'll talk about that later.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llkuc44yRE&t=59" target="_blank">00:00:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But just being able to thumb through your own book was really instructive to see what sentences you underlined and what sections you marked up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llkuc44yRE&t=67" target="_blank">00:01:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and how you jotted down notes in the front and back of the book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llkuc44yRE&t=71" target="_blank">00:01:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And perhaps maybe we could talk about how you mark up your books in the future.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llkuc44yRE&t=74" target="_blank">00:01:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that would be really fascinating to hear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llkuc44yRE&t=76" target="_blank">00:01:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But this week, for these next two episodes, I want you to explain to us why.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llkuc44yRE&t=81" target="_blank">00:01:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Why do you read books?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llkuc44yRE&t=83" target="_blank">00:01:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then who do you read?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llkuc44yRE&t=85" target="_blank">00:01:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the why today and the who on Thursday.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llkuc44yRE&t=88" target="_blank">00:01:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So first, speaking from a macro perspective, what has been the impact of books on your life?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llkuc44yRE&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, what a wonderful question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llkuc44yRE&t=97" target="_blank">00:01:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It would be hard to overstate the life-shaping impact of books on my life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llkuc44yRE&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But I'm going to go back a little bit and lay a foundation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llkuc44yRE&t=109" target="_blank">00:01:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Foundation number one is the Bible is a book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llkuc44yRE&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The implications of that fact are simply staggering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llkuc44yRE&t=117" target="_blank">00:01:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When God contemplated all the possible ways that existed for him as an infinite, omnipotent, all-wise God to transmit and preserve his revelation to the world, he chose a book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llkuc44yRE&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's simply astonishing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llkuc44yRE&t=139" target="_blank">00:02:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We have no other authoritative access to the knowledge of God and the way of salvation and how to live a life pleasing to the Lord than through this book, either directly by reading it or indirectly from others who have read it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llkuc44yRE&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The book is absolutely unique.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llkuc44yRE&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's inspired in all of its words, and that inspiration secures the sufficiency of the book in equipping us for every good deed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llkuc44yRE&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, that very phrase in 2 Timothy 2, 17, "Every good deed" is amazing to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llkuc44yRE&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's an awesome claim that we are equipped, fitted out by this book for every good deed that God expects of us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llkuc44yRE&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He won't expect of us anything he doesn't equip us to do through this book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llkuc44yRE&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's astonishing how unique and powerful this book is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llkuc44yRE&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you add to that Ephesians 3, 4, where Paul said, "When you read this, you can perceive my insight into the mystery of Christ."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llkuc44yRE&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's breathtaking to me, that reading the book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llkuc44yRE&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the inspiration of the book and the reading of the book are the junctures between God and man where saving truth is moved from the divine mind into the human mind and spirit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llkuc44yRE&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is just staggering implications of saying that reading is the way you can perceive my insight into the mystery of Christ, Paul says.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llkuc44yRE&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And of course, it's not possible without the almighty agency of the Holy Spirit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llkuc44yRE&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not merely an intellectual affair, but it's not less than an intellectual affair because God has ordained that his truth come through a book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llkuc44yRE&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And reading is a work of the mind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llkuc44yRE&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And of course, it also doesn't mean—nothing I've said is I intend to imply—that we could just go about this in our own little private cubicle without taking anybody else into account.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llkuc44yRE&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The Bible is crystal clear that God has appointed pastors and teachers, people with spiritual gifts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llkuc44yRE&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And those gifts include wisdom and knowledge and prophecy and teaching and other ways that humans clarify and apply and inspire us with the scriptures.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llkuc44yRE&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So even though God is giving us a book, he means for us to understand the book and apply the book and be inspired by the book with the help of other people who are dead and left their insights in books and who are alive and teach us and preach and counsel and converse with us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llkuc44yRE&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So once the reality of God's privileging the written word with his choice of a book as the decisive means by which he would reveal and preserve the revelation of himself, once that has sunk in, you just can never be indifferent to the reality of books.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llkuc44yRE&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, God has privileged the book, honored the book, elevated the book, esteemed the book above all other means for his centuries-long preservation and explanation of his revelation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llkuc44yRE&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So when I say it would be hard to overstate the life-shaping impact of books on my life, I think I'm saying something very much in line with God's purposes for the world, all that to justify my sentence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llkuc44yRE&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So let me be specific in answer to your question. Number one, books have shown me the glory and the greatness and the character and the attributes and the beauties of God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llkuc44yRE&t=372" target="_blank">00:06:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Number two, books have convicted me of sin. In fact, most books convict me of sin one way or the other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llkuc44yRE&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There was an extended period of time in Germany when every Sunday evening I would read an extended portion of Edward's religious affections and found myself devastated week in and week out as he peeled away the layers of the self-exaltation of my heart.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llkuc44yRE&t=400" target="_blank">00:06:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Number three, books have shown me the path of righteousness. Number four, books have given me inspiration and encouragement in some of my most difficult days.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llkuc44yRE&t=413" target="_blank">00:06:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm thinking here mainly of biography. Number five, books have shaped the way I think and the way I express myself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llkuc44yRE&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And here I'm thinking, of course, of C.S. Lewis here, razor sharp logic and a deep belief in the reality of reason and logic while never elevating it above the essential importance of the imagination and the affections.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llkuc44yRE&t=441" target="_blank">00:07:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's not just only his deep belief in exemplification, setting an example of logic, but the touchable, smellable, tasteable concreteness of his language.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llkuc44yRE&t=458" target="_blank">00:07:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, the power of the concrete over the abstract in helping people grasp the greatest things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llkuc44yRE&t=466" target="_blank">00:07:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Number six, books have cultivated deep convictions in me about things like the aims of reading.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llkuc44yRE&t=475" target="_blank">00:07:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think here of E.D. Hirsch in his book Validity Interpretation that persuaded me profoundly that the only objective grounds for any claim to validity in one's interpretation is that we have found an author's intention in writing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1llkuc44yRE&t=492" target="_blank">00:08:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that's right.
