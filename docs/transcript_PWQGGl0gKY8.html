And it's one reason why it's not something I try to do. —Interesting. Why is that? —When I look at biographies, there seem to be so many instances of people who don't show obvious signs of promise early on. —Interesting.</p><p>And what do you think makes novelists so hard to predict? —They can blossom much later, and very often they do. A very high percentage of them are women whose earlier lives are interrupted, often by children, but not only. That gets back to the late bloomers thing. And there's something quite discreet about a novel, that until a person has done it, it's hard to tell how good they are.</p><p>Or say a great nonfiction book, you know, "Taleb" or "Pinker" or whoever. Like, you could read their earlier blog posts and just see, flat-out see, "Oh, they're really smart. Maybe they could write a great book." Joseph Conrad, like, was I going to get that? Herman Melville. I don't think so.</p></div></div></body></html>
