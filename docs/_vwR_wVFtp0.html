href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=73" target="_blank">00:01:13.800</a></span> | <span class="t">that we ran into the world of ChatDBT, we got into it.</span></div><div

few things we have built,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=85" target="_blank">00:01:25.980</a></span> | <span class="t">and how we have built it, and also, like, how we are going to evaluate them effectively.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So just to be clear, I'm going to talk about two different applications here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=96" target="_blank">00:01:36.460</a></span> | <span class="t">First one is the Chatbot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=97" target="_blank">00:01:37.660</a></span> | <span class="t">No surprise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=99" target="_blank">00:01:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">We have 120 million, almost, users, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=101" target="_blank">00:01:41.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And we get almost 8.5 million contacts every month.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And out of that, Chat is our main channel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And in that channel, right now, 16% of them are first dead with elements.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=114" target="_blank">00:01:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">The results are improving, and we are building agents for different situations,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and then we'll talk about them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And the next one is actually more interesting, and we'll talk about these two applications,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=124" target="_blank">00:02:04.460</a></span> | <span class="t">because in the world of finance, I just heard from Hervey that the complexity of the legal matters are important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">For finance, every single dollar, every single thing matters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And that is important because it creates trust, it makes sure the users are happy with our service, and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So just for a second, let's look at this application.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So in the application, you can see that we have built an agentic system that can do money transfer over voice, image, and chat</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.820</a></span> | <span class="t">at very low inaccuracy, that I'll show you the numbers really soon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Here you can see that the user is connecting their account with WhatsApp.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.780</a></span> | <span class="t">We are asking them multiple times about their password, etc., to make sure they have the right contacts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And once they do all of them, they can give a very simple instruction in a bit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.980</a></span> | <span class="t">that, "Hey, make a transfer to, let's say, 400 TIs."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.660</a></span> | <span class="t">We confirm this is the one that users want, and then, once it confirms, it makes the transfer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.620</a></span> | <span class="t">All you need is to take around 70 seconds to make this transfer to 9 different screens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It's taking less than 30 seconds now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can see the C# is more than 90%, less than 0.5% in accuracy, so on and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And you're doing that on scale.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And I will talk about where evaluations matter and what kind of things matter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So just to be on the same page, the experience of building a chatbot and building an application like this is very different.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Because you need to iterate, but at the same time, you need to think about how to not build one observation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Because if you're building it for one application of this kind, imagine a finance world, you're doing hundreds of these operations to make these changes, or to make money movements, or make micro decisions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Then you're building hundreds of separate systems and agents, which is just not scalable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So, thinking of the fact, what is NuBank LLM ecosystem?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.860</a></span> | <span class="t">NuBank LLM ecosystem has four different layers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.860</a></span> | <span class="t">The first one is core engine, testing and evals, tools, and development experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.860</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't have time, unfortunately, to go over in front of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.860</a></span> | <span class="t">But you can see that in three of them right now we are working very closely with LangSleep, and testing and evals is something we'll talk about, LLM as a job, and also online forward evaluation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And also in the developed experience side, we are using LangGraph and LangSleep from the very beginning from LangSleep, not LangGraph, we are using all of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, how do we use it, and why it matters?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So, the first thing that happens is that without LangGraph, we cannot do more faster iterations, and cannot make it very standard than what a canonical approach we can take to build agentic systems or any kind of black systems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So, the learning there is that complex LM flows can be hard to analyze.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.860</a></span> | <span class="t">centralized LL logs and repositories and graphical interface helps people to make faster decisions, because we don't want only our developers to make decisions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=305" target="_blank">00:05:05.860</a></span> | <span class="t">We want our business users to also contribute to it, and the way to do it is by democratizing data and giving them access to how a business analyst, our product managers, our product operations, our total operations,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=319" target="_blank">00:05:19.860</a></span> | <span class="t">that how they can make faster decisions in terms of how they can make faster decisions in terms of prompt, in terms of adding inputs, in terms of adding parameters of different kinds, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=329" target="_blank">00:05:29.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And last but not the least, we can decrease the cognitive effort to represent flows.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=334" target="_blank">00:05:34.860</a></span> | <span class="t">and this is something that Treyya was mentioning about that the human interaction is difficult for machine-term discovery.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.860</a></span> | <span class="t">To graph basically makes that process easier for us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, to be true to my presentation, I will go to the evaluation

will first talk about a few different challenges overall we have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=355" target="_blank">00:05:55.860</a></span> | <span class="t">The first thing is that, as we heard from Kirby that they are not only in Antarctica.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.860</a></span> | <span class="t">We are only in three countries, so it's a much smaller problem set.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.860</a></span> | <span class="t">But still you can imagine that when you're dealing with like Portuguese, Spanish, the languages, the dialects, the kind of way people talk, etc., that changes across the country.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=374" target="_blank">00:06:14.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And we have 58% of Brazilian population that are customers now, so we have to understand what users are talking about, etc., very extensively.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.860</a></span> | <span class="t">The second thing is that Nubank's brand presence is huge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.860</a></span> | <span class="t">We are more popular than some of the well-known brands like McDonald's or Nike even in Brazil.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So we cannot do anything, especially when it comes to jailbreak or garters, it's very important for us to keep a very high cost.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And last but not the least, we have to pay curate in our messaging.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=400" target="_blank">00:06:40.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Because at the end of the day, we are dealing with people's funding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And money is something that people care about, about advocacy, and losing trust over money transfer is very easy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=413" target="_blank">00:06:53.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So taking a step back again, actually moving a little forward, on the customer service side and the money transfer is based,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=420" target="_blank">00:07:00.860</a></span> | <span class="t">we have very different needs from a business side and from a technical side that are kind of valuations we need.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=426" target="_blank">00:07:06.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So in the case of customer service, in addition to accuracy, what matters a lot is how are we approaching a customer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=433" target="_blank">00:07:13.860</a></span> | <span class="t">If a customer is calling us, "Hey, where is my card?" or "Hey, I see this chart that I don't recognize."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=439" target="_blank">00:07:19.860</a></span> | <span class="t">If we give a very robotic experience, we lose the customer's trust and equity and it matters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=445" target="_blank">00:07:25.860</a></span> | <span class="t">It's very easy for human to have this connection.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=448" target="_blank">00:07:28.860</a></span> | <span class="t">It's very hard for machine to have this connection and we all know that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=451" target="_blank">00:07:31.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Also, very high flattening doesn't work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=453" target="_blank">00:07:33.860</a></span> | <span class="t">I think a lot of you have seen that what happened with the activity 4.1 model, last week, and we called and then they launched.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=460" target="_blank">00:07:40.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So in addition, in order to do this to judge well, we need to think about, do we understand customers in terms well?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=467" target="_blank">00:07:47.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Do we understand that how are we retrieving content and context from different sources that we have internally?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=473" target="_blank">00:07:53.860</a></span> | <span class="t">What is the deep link accuracy that we have?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=476" target="_blank">00:07:56.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Because imagine our app is 3,000 pages, and in 3,000 pages we have hundreds of deep links and basically landing a user to the way up of the node</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=486" target="_blank">00:08:06.860</a></span> | <span class="t">and then asking the server through different clicks and go to the page where they get self-service is very tedious and not very effective.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=493" target="_blank">00:08:13.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And last but not the least, we need to make sure that we are not hallucinating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=497" target="_blank">00:08:17.860</a></span> | <span class="t">While there's a money transfer, tone and sentiment is okay, but we need to be accurate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=504" target="_blank">00:08:24.860</a></span> | <span class="t">But the accuracy is not only about the transfer money, but also who we are transferring.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Which source we are using for transfer?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=512" target="_blank">00:08:32.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Does the person have enough money in their account?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=515" target="_blank">00:08:35.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Are there a broad suspect?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=516" target="_blank">00:08:36.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Do they have a petting collection?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=518" target="_blank">00:08:38.860</a></span> | <span class="t">All of these things are very intricately connected because our customers are using not only one product,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=522" target="_blank">00:08:42.860</a></span> | <span class="t">but also the product from lending, to financing, to investment, to banking, to credit card, etc.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=530" target="_blank">00:08:50.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And also, often times, they have dependent accounts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=533" target="_blank">00:08:53.860</a></span> | <span class="t">They have multiple cards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=534" target="_blank">00:08:54.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you look at all of them together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=536" target="_blank">00:08:56.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So what's important there is that can you identify the named agent recognition properly?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=541" target="_blank">00:09:01.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Because you can say, hey, send $100 to my brother.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=546" target="_blank">00:09:06.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, say you only have one brother, you have saved your brother, and you have sent money before, it's easy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=551" target="_blank">00:09:11.860</a></span> | <span class="t">But imagine the situation where you have not done that with your multiple brothers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=555" target="_blank">00:09:15.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's like, my favorite brother, my next favorite brother, didn't come to identify with which brother I'm talking about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=561" target="_blank">00:09:21.860</a></span> | <span class="t">to send the money, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=562" target="_blank">00:09:22.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Because then they don't want to send money to my next favorite brother.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=565" target="_blank">00:09:25.860</a></span> | <span class="t">The next one is about making sure the correct interpretation of the user input.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=571" target="_blank">00:09:31.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Because if the user is saying that, hey, I want to send $100, but do it tomorrow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=576" target="_blank">00:09:36.860</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a different instruction than doing it right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=579" target="_blank">00:09:39.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Because if I do it right now, maybe you will learn that it over time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=582" target="_blank">00:09:42.860</a></span> | <span class="t">The last but not the least also identifies that what is the correct action.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=586" target="_blank">00:09:46.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Because the user might be saying that, I don't want to send it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=590" target="_blank">00:09:50.860</a></span> | <span class="t">The last tape you saw, I want to cancel it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=592" target="_blank">00:09:52.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So we didn't understand that as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=594" target="_blank">00:09:54.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So all of these things matter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=595" target="_blank">00:09:55.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And evaluation for all of these things matter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=598" target="_blank">00:09:58.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Without them, we cannot launch a problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=602" target="_blank">00:10:02.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So in absence of Evalor, in absence of a tool like Landscape, what happens,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=608" target="_blank">00:10:08.860</a></span> | <span class="t">is that we have a linear path of development.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=611" target="_blank">00:10:11.860</a></span> | <span class="t">We are running every tests.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=612" target="_blank">00:10:12.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Because we make all decisions with any tests.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=614" target="_blank">00:10:14.860</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not sure if I could cover it before, but we have 1,800 services that we do deployment every 2 minutes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=620" target="_blank">00:10:20.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So we do every decision by any tests.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=623" target="_blank">00:10:23.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's with the linear path.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=626" target="_blank">00:10:26.860</a></span> | <span class="t">But if we have a system that can very well connect the traces and give observabilities,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=634" target="_blank">00:10:34.860</a></span> | <span class="t">give login and then alert on top of it, so on and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=639" target="_blank">00:10:39.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Then we have a full cycle of observability to filtering, to define data sets, to run experiments and so on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=645" target="_blank">00:10:45.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is the final we have in other situations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=650" target="_blank">00:10:50.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And we are building with Landscape for our generative AI applications.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=655" target="_blank">00:10:55.860</a></span> | <span class="t">I think these two things I've heard a few times in this last couple of talks about offline evaluation and online evaluation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=663" target="_blank">00:11:03.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So I will not go in very deep details of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=666" target="_blank">00:11:06.860</a></span> | <span class="t">But as you can see, in the case of offline evaluation, this is after the experiment results,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=674" target="_blank">00:11:14.860</a></span> | <span class="t">we take them to the other apps and we have individual evaluation and we have pairwise evaluation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=680" target="_blank">00:11:20.860</a></span> | <span class="t">For both of them, I will mostly, I will talk about it later, but we primarily use human labellers in that process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=691" target="_blank">00:11:31.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we currently also using algorithms and other custom heuristics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=695" target="_blank">00:11:35.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Based on all of that, we run statistical tests and the linear variant is something that we launch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=701" target="_blank">00:11:41.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Things get more interesting, actually not at this stage, but at the online stage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=706" target="_blank">00:11:46.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Because in online evaluation, you can run things in your sandboxes, in your own, like, more controlled environments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=714" target="_blank">00:11:54.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And in that situation, you have a more continuous view of improvement and development.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=720" target="_blank">00:12:00.860</a></span> | <span class="t">If we only do the online evaluation, then our decision-making speed, especially for developers and analysts, is much slower.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=734" target="_blank">00:12:14.860</a></span> | <span class="t">But if we can do good online evaluation, and tracing, and logging, and alerting, etc., then our development speed goes up significantly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=742" target="_blank">00:12:22.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So we are doing both of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=745" target="_blank">00:12:25.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, last but not least, I will talk about LLM as a judge, which is something we have talked about a few times.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=751" target="_blank">00:12:31.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And the question basically goes back quite many years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=754" target="_blank">00:12:34.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Imagine the situation I was describing about the money transfer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=757" target="_blank">00:12:37.860</a></span> | <span class="t">In that situation, you need to understand who we are sending, what the requests, how much money, from where, all of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=763" target="_blank">00:12:43.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And doing all of that, sending, let's say, we are currently doing, say, a few hundred thousand or a few million such transactions every day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=772" target="_blank">00:12:52.860</a></span> | <span class="t">That amount of data, and that amount of labeling, even if we do sampling, it's not enough to maintain the quality of the product.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=780" target="_blank">00:13:00.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's why we need to do more labeling, and doing it only when it's not scalable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=785" target="_blank">00:13:05.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Because training, how people understand, the mistakes people make, and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=790" target="_blank">00:13:10.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So our part was that, let's build LLM as a judge, and try to keep the quality of the judge at the same level of human.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=800" target="_blank">00:13:20.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we started with the first test, with a simple prompt, we do the 4-0 mini model, because it's cheap.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=806" target="_blank">00:13:26.860</a></span> | <span class="t">We didn't do any time tuning in, and see how it works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=809" target="_blank">00:13:29.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And we got that in, like, humans were making 80% accurate decisions, and 20% mistakes, and something like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=818" target="_blank">00:13:38.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Everyone's exact doesn't show that, but you can imagine that way, a little bit as an accuracy metric.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=824" target="_blank">00:13:44.860</a></span> | <span class="t">We are at 51%, and in the case 2, we moved to a fine-tuned model, and we increased the 8-1 score from 51 to 59.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=836" target="_blank">00:13:56.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Next test, we changed the prompt, and we got B2, and we got a big jump of 11% point of 17.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=844" target="_blank">00:14:04.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So we made another declaration of 4-0, from 4-0 mini to 4-0, it's a better, better, and bigger model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=850" target="_blank">00:14:10.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Changed the prompt again in test 5, changed the pine-tuning again in test 6, and this is where we landed, where we are at x-1 score of 79% compared to 80% of humans, which is quite comparable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=864" target="_blank">00:14:24.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, you might ask, next time, why did you move from test 5 to test 6, the prompt was 80, and 79%, because in 79%, we are identifying the inaccurate information better,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=876" target="_blank">00:14:36.860</a></span> | <span class="t">and a more, like, more, like, more, like, more inaccuracy we are catching there, that's why we are in here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=881" target="_blank">00:14:41.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And just to no surprise, but actually quite surprising, this whole development took us maybe around 2 weeks, with a couple of developers, to go through these 6 iterations,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=891" target="_blank">00:14:51.860</a></span> | <span class="t">and we can only do it because we have the online tracing and system in place, otherwise it wouldn't be possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=897" target="_blank">00:14:57.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So, taking up, like, wrapping it up all, there is no magic in building any agent, any element, it's hard work, evals are hard work,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=909" target="_blank">00:15:09.860</a></span> | <span class="t">and if you don't evaluate, you don't know what you are building, and if you don't know what you are building, then you cannot ship it to the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=917" target="_blank">00:15:17.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So, do more evals, spend more time, understand what your users are saying, think about not only hallucinations and anxiety, etc.,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=924" target="_blank">00:15:24.860</a></span> | <span class="t">but also, like, nuanced situations of, like, empathy, tone of voice, those things matter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=931" target="_blank">00:15:31.860</a></span> | <span class="t">We are in a very exciting time, and thank you all for listening to me, and thank you all for listening to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=939" target="_blank">00:15:39.860</a></span> | <span class="t">We are now going to a 20 minute break before our next session.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=952" target="_blank">00:15:52.860</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to mention to you about Boba, a bar located in a very group-top, an espresso-carsel, in an area for the residents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vwR_wVFtp0&t=959"

On through these.</span></div></div></body></html>
