But then a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=89" target="_blank">00:01:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">moment later, Sam Altman says he has no particular comment on that unfortunate leak. Well, that kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.520</a></span> | <span class="t">of is a comment because he's confirming that it was a leak. So that seems to imply that there are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=100" target="_blank">00:01:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">researchers concerned about the safety of their recent breakthroughs. At least what we do have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">is a bit more clarity about why the board fired Sam Altman in the first place. In this New Yorker</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">exclusive, we learn that some members of the board found Sam Altman an unnervingly slippery</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=117" target="_blank">00:01:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">operator. One of the board members, Helen Toner, had written a paper covered in one of my previous</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">videos that was slightly critical of the release of ChatGPT. Anyway, Sam Altman began approaching</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">other board members individually about replacing her. And here comes the key moment. When these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">members compared notes about the conversations, some felt that Altman had misrepresented them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And in the eyes of the board, he'd play them off against each other by lying about what other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">people thought. "The person familiar with the board's discussions told me." That's sometimes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">journalistic code for an actual member of the board speaking to this journalist. Things like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that had been happening for years. And then again, when the article says, "A person familiar with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=155" target="_blank">00:02:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Altman's perspective said," that could well be Sam Altman himself. Of course it might not be,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">but anyway, that source said, "He acknowledges having been ham-fisted in the way he tried to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">get a board member removed." Of course, we as outsiders have no idea about the actual reality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">What we do know though, is that again, this source, the person familiar with Sam Altman's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">perspective, might be him, might not be, said that he and the board had engaged in very normal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and healthy boardroom debate, but that some board members were unversed in business norms and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">daunted by their responsibilities. And then I love this quote. This person noted, "Every step we get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">closer to AGI, everybody takes on like 10 insanity points." Well, I'm asking you, how many insanity</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">points is the world gonna take on when we actually get AGI, let alone super intelligence? I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I could do a three-hour video on that alone, but I've got other news to get to in this video.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Before we move on though, one last quote from this long and very interesting New Yorker exclusive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">"The context is that Sam Altman and OpenAI have agreed to an independent review into the events</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">leading up to his firing." And Sam Altman's quote on that is that he's super excited about that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">review. That is an interesting thing to get super excited about, but let's move on. There are two or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">three more details that we've learned from the reporting that's happened since. For example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that Ilya Sutskova did not expect the company's researchers to question the board's decision.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And he specifically touted Greg Brockman and OpenAI's research director as key assets that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">OpenAI still had on hand. Of course, that was hours before they quit. This means that we can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">deduce that they didn't expect the company to implode. It was less like, "We know this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">gonna end OpenAI and we're doing it anyway," and a bit more like, "Uh, oops." And here's one more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">thing we learned. I mentioned at the time that employees from OpenAI were applying to Google</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">DeepMind. I mentioned that other companies like Cohere and Anthropic were trying to gain staff</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">from OpenAI. Well, either those interviews didn't go well or the employees changed their minds</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">because Sam Watman said a few days ago, "Throughout this whole thing, we did not lose a single</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">employee." Speaking of Google DeepMind though, they're beset by their own complications. They</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">have delayed Gemini now to January, according to two people with knowledge of the decision,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.760</a></span> | <span class="t">as reported in the information. Gemini is their multimodal model that's supposed to be a competitor</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">or improvement upon GPT-4. But buried in the article is this fascinating paragraph,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">"A key challenge for the Gemini team is making sure the primary model is as good as or better</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">than GPT-4. It has met that standard in some respects," said one of the people familiar with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.720</a></span> | <span class="t">it. They go on, "But the company is still making improvements because it wants the technology to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=316" target="_blank">00:05:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">work well globally in numerous languages." That, by the way, was apparently the cause of the delay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=322" target="_blank">00:05:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">The company found that their AI, Gemini, didn't reliably handle some non-English queries.

In comparison,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=356" target="_blank">00:05:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">high or mid resource languages have significantly lower attack success rates.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">My guess as to why Google DeepMind cares so much about those multilingual jailbreaks is that the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">performance of their models in different languages is one of their main selling points.

Speaking of jailbreaks, I think that's the key reason why OpenAI's GPT</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">store was delayed to next year.

And while the press release mentioned the OpenAI drama as the key reason,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=412" target="_blank">00:06:52.560</a></span> | <span class="t">they also mentioned this in a key sentence. "There have been some questions around uploaded</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=417" target="_blank">00:06:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">files.

Indeed, as the Wired report, some researchers at Northwestern</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=444" target="_blank">00:07:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">University found that it was surprisingly straightforward to reveal information from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=449" target="_blank">00:07:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">these custom GPTs.

The first key finding that we get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=477" target="_blank">00:07:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">is that in all of the models they test, Lama, ChatGPT, and many others, the models have memorized</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=483" target="_blank">00:08:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">part of their training data.

If you can extract that data, which this paper does, that means you can get information</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=500" target="_blank">00:08:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">on private individuals.

Here's a gem from one of the footnotes. They say, "In fact,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=635" target="_blank">00:10:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">in early August, a month after we discovered this attack, multiple independent researchers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=640" target="_blank">00:10:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">discovered the underlying exploit used in our paper." But it goes on, "Like us initially,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=644" target="_blank">00:10:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">they did not realize that the model was regenerating training data."

"To be clear,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbTqo3GOtk&t=671" target="_blank">00:11:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">some of these outputs are often nonsensical, not from the training data.
