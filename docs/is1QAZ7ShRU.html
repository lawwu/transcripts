And here's a quote from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3629" target="_blank">01:00:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">his comments. In recent years, we've developed increasingly complex systems to manage content</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3633" target="_blank">01:00:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">across our platforms, partly in response to societal and political pressures to moderate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3638" target="_blank">01:00:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">content. This approach has gone too far. Remember back in August, Zuck sent a letter to the House</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3644" target="_blank">01:00:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Judiciary Committee explaining how the FBI and Biden administration have pressured Facebook into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3649" target="_blank">01:00:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">censoring posts about COVID and Hunter Biden, you'll also remember that Zuckerberg has over 3</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3655" target="_blank">01:00:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">billion members to his platform, and had no problem banning Trump from the platform after January 6,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3663" target="_blank">01:01:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot to talk about in this topic, cyan, what's your general take of Zuck going MAGA? How do you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3672" target="_blank">01:01:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">interpret his part? I actually think deep down inside, he always has been, you know, I go back</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3679" target="_blank">01:01:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to the beginning days of Facebook. And when there was social networks that were competing with back</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3685" target="_blank">01:01:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">at the time was MySpace, the only political party you could be was Republican or Democrat. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3690" target="_blank">01:01:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">along came Facebook, and he added this third option called libertarian. And I would like to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3695" target="_blank">01:01:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">go to the Wayback Machine at some point and find his profile because his profile said he was a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3699" target="_blank">01:01:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">libertarian. So when he started Facebook, you know, that that's where he leaned. So I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3705" target="_blank">01:01:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">he's always been a free speech person. I think he's always, this has been deep in his heart,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3709" target="_blank">01:01:49.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I think what happened was he had enormous success, they grew very large, and he had to become neutral.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3715" target="_blank">01:01:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Or he thought he did. And so I think what we're seeing with Zuck right now with his change in his,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3720" target="_blank">01:02:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, even how he appears with a gold chain and how he's dressing and everything that he's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3726" target="_blank">01:02:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">doing, is him going back to his roots to be more authentic, because I think he hasn't been authentic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3731" target="_blank">01:02:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">for a long time. And, and that was a big critique that people had of him, you know, they were just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3734" target="_blank">01:02:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">like when he talks, he's like a robot. And I think what we're seeing is him coming out of his shell,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3740" target="_blank">01:02:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and I don't know if fighting helped it or what helped it. But, you know, I do think it's the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3745" target="_blank">01:02:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">best thing to do. And all the platforms need to do it and should embrace it. And it can be game,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3750" target="_blank">01:02:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">though, community notes can be game that we saw it with, I saw a report that, you know, Kamala's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3756" target="_blank">01:02:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">campaign or I don't know, they directly work for her what happened, but they did take over community</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3762" target="_blank">01:02:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">notes on X and started manipulating them. So you have to be really careful, you know, how you run</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3767" target="_blank">01:02:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">a community. But in general, I'm all for it. I think it's the right move. It's but one signal,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3772" target="_blank">01:02:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">it's one system for trying to get to the truth. It's not the only one fact checking is another one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3777" target="_blank">01:02:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And having no system is another one.

And what do you attribute Zuckerberg's massive 180 here?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3793" target="_blank">01:03:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I would start by saying I think he's a phenomenal businessman. I mean, I think the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3797" target="_blank">01:03:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the results speak for itself. But I also think that that is exactly what explains the shift.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3804" target="_blank">01:03:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">In many ways, he had to make that shift. I think it's fair to say that in the Obama and Biden</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3811" target="_blank">01:03:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">administrations, when the winds were blowing towards censorship, they were part of that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3818" target="_blank">01:03:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">machinery. And that was the value maximizing function for Facebook shareholders in that time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3824" target="_blank">01:03:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Because if you push back against that, it's not clear what would have happened to Facebook in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3829" target="_blank">01:03:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">other ways. And so I think the decision, whether he morally agreed with it or not, almost didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3836" target="_blank">01:03:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">matter. It's the leadership of the country in which I operate is telling me it's going to go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3841" target="_blank">01:04:01.040</a></span> | <span class="t">this way, I go that way. Once the Biden and Obama administration sort of went to the wayside,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3846" target="_blank">01:04:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a very interesting picture that Donald Trump put in his book.

Yeah, I watched their news conference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3924" target="_blank">01:05:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And I thought it was a very good news conference. I think they've honestly I think they've come a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3928" target="_blank">01:05:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">long way meta. I think he's directly responding to the threats that you have made to him in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3933" target="_blank">01:05:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">past.

I think Elon didn't make a value maximizing function, he made a moral decision.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3950" target="_blank">01:05:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">He did it when it was unpopular and where the winds were clearly blowing in the opposite direction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3955" target="_blank">01:05:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Now that those winds have changed, and it's clear Trump won in early November. The decisions you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3961" target="_blank">01:06:01.200</a></span> | <span class="t">make in January are more reflective of the new conditions on the field coming into the inauguration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3965" target="_blank">01:06:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But I do think it's the smart value maximizing decision yet again for Facebook shareholders.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3971" target="_blank">01:06:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think it begets a broader point. I think the thing is, when you see Elon operate,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3978" target="_blank">01:06:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">he's a complete outlier in many dimensions. But I think the one dimension where it matters the most</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3984" target="_blank">01:06:24.240</a></span> | <span class="t">is that he acts morally. And in the best interests of what he believes humanity benefits from,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3991" target="_blank">01:06:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">he's always done it, he was willing to torch $44 billion when he bought Twitter in order to do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=3996" target="_blank">01:06:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And so he does these things from his own perspective. I don't think there's any other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4001" target="_blank">01:06:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">CEO that leads this way. And I don't think they should necessarily I do think that, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4007" target="_blank">01:06:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">marks a good person. But his intimate feelings should be known by his wife, his children,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4013" target="_blank">01:06:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">his friends, his family. I don't think we as shareholders have any right to know necessarily,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4018" target="_blank">01:06:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Elon is different.

But I wouldn't conflate everybody else with him. So I think that this is a smart</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4029" target="_blank">01:07:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">business decision. It makes a ton of sense. And as you can see, he was basically told to do this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4035" target="_blank">01:07:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So he complied. Freeburg, your thoughts on Zuckerberg making this decision? If Kamala</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4044" target="_blank">01:07:24.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Harris had one, would he have released a statement or added Dana White to the board of Facebook?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4050" target="_blank">01:07:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Probably not.

Kamala wins,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4056" target="_blank">01:07:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">he would not have done this. He is jumping in front of a marching band. And he is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4062" target="_blank">01:07:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">band leader.

NVIDIA made a big announcement</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=4823" target="_blank">01:20:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">at CES this week.

Yeah. In fact, Chamath has made a big bet there with his time, with his software startup</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5688" target="_blank">01:34:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that he's created. All right, let's end on the United States of America growing from 50 to 60</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5695" target="_blank">01:34:55.520</a></span> | <span class="t">or 70 states. Trump has been rattling off some ideas around this. Chamath, what's your take on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5703" target="_blank">01:35:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">it? I know we got to get wrapped up here. So we'll just do a quick lightning round on it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5707" target="_blank">01:35:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, I thought it was really interesting. And I was just caught off guard at how the media tried</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5714" target="_blank">01:35:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to portray it as Trump being Trump. Goofy, whatever, colorful. But I think like what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5720" target="_blank">01:35:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I've realized, even with the California fire thing, the guy has this prescient way of,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5725" target="_blank">01:35:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">he may not say it in the way that it works for some people, but he's just really on top of this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5731" target="_blank">01:35:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">stuff. So I just had to make a thing. So I started to learn a little bit more about why he wants to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5736" target="_blank">01:35:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">take over Greenland. And it really comes down to one very basic idea here. Because of climate change</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5744" target="_blank">01:35:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and other things, the Arctic ice shelf is melting. And the more and more it melts, it opens up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5750" target="_blank">01:35:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">a shipping lane in the Northern Passage for a lot of critical goods. And so if you had some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5758" target="_blank">01:35:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of strategic agreement with Canada and Greenland, you effectively have this monopoly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5764" target="_blank">01:36:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">control over something that could become as important as the Panama Canal. And so I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5770" target="_blank">01:36:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">if you look across the world, the control of maritime shipping lanes becomes this really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5777" target="_blank">01:36:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">critical, strategic, military and economic asset. And so the reason why he's trying to find a way</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5785" target="_blank">01:36:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">to initiate some sort of a discussion between Greenland and Canada is exactly this reason.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5792" target="_blank">01:36:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think it's sort of like a bargaining gambit the way that he started. But it's really smart</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5797" target="_blank">01:36:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">that he's trying to get this done for the United States of America. Because meanwhile, what you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5801" target="_blank">01:36:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">have is China militarizing very aggressively, Russia militarizing very aggressively. And what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5807" target="_blank">01:36:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">you don't want to have happen is those two countries take control of that Northern Passage</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5812" target="_blank">01:36:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">as the ice sheet melts. So I just thought that was important. Having a capable business executive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5817" target="_blank">01:36:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">thinking about the future of business and shipping and logistics. Pretty, pretty big win. And I just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5823" target="_blank">01:37:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">love the idea, Cyan. You know what's smart? I mean, let's give Trump credit. What's so smart</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5827" target="_blank">01:37:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">is like, somebody was doing this work. Yes. Got it, got it in front of him. Yeah. And he was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5832" target="_blank">01:37:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">smart enough to say, hold on a second, this is really important. Let me tweet it. And then the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5837" target="_blank">01:37:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">way that he initiates it, though, gets even more attention. Because if he basically tweeted,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5843" target="_blank">01:37:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">hey, guys, I have this really interesting idea to gain more leverage in the Northern Maritime</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5847" target="_blank">01:37:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">shipping lane, nobody would have paid attention.

And now we're all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5851" target="_blank">01:37:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">talking about it. And now there's an opportunity for millions of people to understand why and be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5856" target="_blank">01:37:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">supportive of it. It's pretty smart. Cyan, any thoughts on expanding the United States to a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5860" target="_blank">01:37:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">couple more territories and states?

I would love to have 60 states in our lifetime.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5865" target="_blank">01:37:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, let's pick one in the Caribbean. Let's pick one in Europe. I think we should have an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5869" target="_blank">01:37:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">open invitation. Jason, that's not what he's doing. I think he's... I know I'm being a bit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5873" target="_blank">01:37:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">facetious here. This is very strategic, this one. But I'm just thinking the next time, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5878" target="_blank">01:37:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I would like to get Cuba, maybe Portugal. I don't know who 80% of people, Cyan, what do you think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5883" target="_blank">01:38:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">in the country want to join? Join. It's very strategic. If you look at the Panama Canal,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5887" target="_blank">01:38:07.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I believe either end is operated and controlled by China. We are at war with China, whether we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5893" target="_blank">01:38:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">like to admit it or not, in my opinion. And so this is very strategic. He has a very strange way</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5899" target="_blank">01:38:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">of communicating, as you pointed out, but I think it's brilliant. And I actually think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5902" target="_blank">01:38:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">we should add to that. I've always thought that we should open up and add more states</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5908" target="_blank">01:38:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and extend that invitation, you know, to Taiwan. It might be controversial to even say India.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5915" target="_blank">01:38:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">But I do think that there's a lot of countries out there and people who really,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5921" target="_blank">01:38:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">really resonate with what it means to be an American and the freedoms that come with our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1QAZ7ShRU&t=5928" target="_blank">01:38:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">subscription fees of this country.
