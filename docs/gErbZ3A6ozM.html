First, I recently published my latest article</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=32" target="_blank">00:00:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">for The New Yorker. This was a 5,000 word long form piece. I thought this would be a good occasion</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=38" target="_blank">00:00:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to give you a peek inside my long form article writing process. So I'll walk you through how I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=45" target="_blank">00:00:45.520</a></span> | <span class="t">actually put that article together from the original conception to publication. Second,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=50" target="_blank">00:00:50.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to give you an update on my book, Slow Productivity, let you know what I've finished,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=56" target="_blank">00:00:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">where my word count is, what my plan is going forward for the next month or so.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=60" target="_blank">00:01:00.640</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, so let's start talking about my long form article writing process. So this latest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=67" target="_blank">00:01:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">article for The New Yorker was titled something like, "What Hunter-Gatherers Can Teach Us About</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=74" target="_blank">00:01:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Improving Work." That's not quite right, but it was a title like that. But the premise of this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=78" target="_blank">00:01:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">article was to look back at the deep history of the concept of work. So going all the way back to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=85" target="_blank">00:01:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the 300,000 years we spent during the Paleolithic age, living in small hunter-gatherer tribes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">look back at what work meant for us throughout most of that history, and then compare that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=97" target="_blank">00:01:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">to what work means today for those of us who work in knowledge work at a computer screen all day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And the premise was where we find big mismatches between what we used to do through most of our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=109" target="_blank">00:01:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">history and what we do today, we might find places where work is making us exhausted,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">where work is frustrating us, we might get some ideas for reforming modern work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=118" target="_blank">00:01:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So that was the concept I had from the beginning. That was the concept I pitched, but that's very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=124" target="_blank">00:02:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">broad. So how do we get from that concept to a 5,000-word edited piece? I want to bring you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">into my process. So I've loaded up here actually on my computer the Scrivener file I used to write</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">this article. So it's a look back essentially through the history of this piece. And I can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">tell you where I started with this piece, as I do for some but not all, was actually with one of my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">research assistants. He read a bunch of books, he read a bunch of articles, loaded it all into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Google Doc, came back here to the HQ. We spent an afternoon just talking it through, bouncing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the ideas off of each other. This is me just trying on what seems interesting here, what doesn't. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">it gave me an entry point into this topic area. Once that work was done, I created the Scrivener</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">project for this article. Scrivener is what I use to do my non-fiction writing. And the very first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">thing I did was created a folder. I'm looking at it right now, where I brought into it every article</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that my research assistant had found, every note that he had sent me, and a rough summary of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">conversation that we had. So that is now the research seed for this article. The second thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I do is added a current outline file. So every one of my Scrivener projects in the research section</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">on the left bar, I always have a current outline file. I put three asterisks on either side of it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">so it'll get eye-catching. I can put at the top and it's eye-catching. It's the sort of master</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">file. And I began working on an outline. This brings me to the next stage of the writing process,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">which is significantly more research to support the specific outline I have now written. See,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the sequencing here is important. I need to know something about the field before I can write a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">good outline. But I need a good outline before I know what else I need to know about the field.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I'm looking now at my research folders on Scrivener. I see one, two, three, four,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.760</a></span> | <span class="t">five different directories full of notes on particular topics, plus an additional, I counted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">it earlier, 29 different additional files and papers I found along the way that didn't fit into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">one of those directories or the other. So I have a large amount of research notes. Everything that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I might use in the article is here. Up to this point, this had been largely second shift work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you've listened to my earlier weekly updates where I introduced this concept,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">typically what I do is have a first shift, second shift project when I'm doing deep work. The first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">shift gets the morning, it gets the most of my time and attention. The second shift is usually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">something a little bit less cognitively demanding. That happens in the afternoon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">When it became time to start writing that first draft, the New Yorker piece now becomes first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">shift work. I can't write at that level in the afternoon. As an aside, it has to be my main</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">point of concentration for that day. Now, I don't know exactly how long it took me to write this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.520</a></span> | <span class="t">first draft. I think it was three weeks if I remember. And it was a beast. 7,000 plus words</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I wrote just day by day, piece by piece writing it. Now, here's an important distinction. As I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">write, I keep coming across things where I don't have the right source or don't know enough</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=322" target="_blank">00:05:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">information. So I will stop my writing at that point, find that research, bring it in the Scrivener.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So those six folders and 29 or 30 pieces of extra research I talked about, that's where I ended up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=333" target="_blank">00:05:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Not where I started. That grows as I write. I just write day after day, slow and steady.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">If the next section I need to write in the article needs a lot of research and that takes up the rest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">of my time that morning finding the research, that's what I do. So I get to the end of this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=348" target="_blank">00:05:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Now I've done three weeks of writing. I've been doing research on this article for well over one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=353" target="_blank">00:05:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">or two months at this point. 7,000 words. I give it some breathing room, put it aside, work on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">something else, come back to it, I look at it. And in the case for this article, I looked at those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">7,000 words and said, "This isn't it." That's all just gut. But it was a little flabby.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=371" target="_blank">00:06:11.120</a></span> | <span class="t">The through line of the logic in certain places I thought was not as rock solid as it could be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">The structure wasn't pulling me fast enough through. I thought the structure had a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=382" target="_blank">00:06:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">bit of extra weight on it. It just wasn't right. And what I did at this point is I just told my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">editor, "I've written a bunch. I don't think it's right. I'm taking another swing." Back to first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=393" target="_blank">00:06:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">shift work, blank page, pulling stuff from the old draft as needed, wrote it again from scratch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=400" target="_blank">00:06:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">This time I came in at 5,000 words and this was something I could work with. That was the piece I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=407" target="_blank">00:06:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">then went through several editing drafts. Again, first shift work until that was ready for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=411" target="_blank">00:06:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">submission. And then it goes into the whole production process. Those details I'll leave</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=416" target="_blank">00:06:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">aside for now. That's when I've been working with the magazine to get it ready. And the only thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=420" target="_blank">00:07:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to add to that is figuring out how to start over. This was largely something that was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=426" target="_blank">00:07:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">accomplished on foot. And again, my memory for this piece, it was one walk, one long walk where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=432" target="_blank">00:07:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I started working through why wasn't the original piece working? What might work better? And it was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=438" target="_blank">00:07:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">in that walk that I came up with a brand new construction that was a little bit ambitious for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=445" target="_blank">00:07:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">me, but I thought would work better. If you read the article, you will see it's a construction in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=449" target="_blank">00:07:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">which I interleave Apple computer and the protest among their employees about the return to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=455" target="_blank">00:07:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">office. I interleave that with work from the 1960s of a pioneering anthropologist studying an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=461" target="_blank">00:07:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">extant hunter-gatherer tribe. I go back and forth, go back and forth until the connection is finally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=467" target="_blank">00:07:47.120</a></span> | <span class="t">made clear. And then I keep this intertwining through the rest of the piece. The other thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=471" target="_blank">00:07:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I figured out as I was going along on this article, just to let you in a little bit, was the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=476" target="_blank">00:07:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">strip back, strip back, pulled out detail, tightened, get in, get out, make the point, give</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=482" target="_blank">00:08:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the evidence. So that's what it looks like to write a piece like this. It's a chicken and the egg</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=487" target="_blank">00:08:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">problem up front where you need to know enough about the topic in order to actually figure out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=490" target="_blank">00:08:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">what to write about the topic, which teaches you what you want to figure out about the topic. That's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=494" target="_blank">00:08:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">all circular. Then you have to just write. Then you have to just be ready to say this doesn't work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=499" target="_blank">00:08:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Then you're walking, then you're thinking, then you take another swing and you do that till</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=503" target="_blank">00:08:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">you get it. Let's give another quick update on my book, Slow Productivity. I'm loading up the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Scrivener project for that right now. So as mentioned in previous episodes, the book has two</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=515" target="_blank">00:08:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">parts. Part one, part two. Part two is the longer. I'm done with part two. I finished that last week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=521" target="_blank">00:08:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I have a nice draft of that that I'm ready to submit to my publisher. I'll load it up here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=527" target="_blank">00:08:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Part two ended up being, this was a good 30,000 words of well-edited text. And I am now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=537" target="_blank">00:08:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">have begun part one. Three major chapters to write in there, about halfway through the first.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=543" target="_blank">00:09:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">My goal for the rest of November is I would like to finish that first chapter. I wanted to finish</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=550" target="_blank">00:09:10.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the second chapter in November. Right now I'm aiming at be significantly into that second</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=554" target="_blank">00:09:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">chapter by the time I get to December. So again, I'm a little behind still where I wanted to be,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=562" target="_blank">00:09:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">but roughly on track. This is back to my first shift work right now. It's what I did this morning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=567" target="_blank">00:09:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">It's what I'm going to do tomorrow morning. Write first thing, write first thing. The research</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=572" target="_blank">00:09:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">collection, the Scrivener for this book is getting pretty big because it cites a lot of things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=576" target="_blank">00:09:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a lot of quotes, a lot of show don't tell in this. And so I'm getting a pretty rich</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=581" target="_blank">00:09:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">collection of folders and subfolders and subfolders full of articles, but I'm still having fun with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=586" target="_blank">00:09:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">it. Progress is still happening. So that's where the book is more or less on track. That's a look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gErbZ3A6ozM&t=591" target="_blank">00:09:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">inside my long form articles.
