href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=421" target="_blank">00:07:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So with vesting, these would be looking at both the employer matching contributions,

the employer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=482" target="_blank">00:08:02.100</a></span> | <span class="t">matches it, it seems that

higher employee</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=607" target="_blank">00:10:07.660</a></span> | <span class="t">contribution

70% of participants essentially do at least maximize the match, if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=614" target="_blank">00:10:14.740</a></span> | <span class="t">not save more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=616"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=618" target="_blank">00:10:18.760</a></span> | <span class="t">In other words, they're doing two levels of match.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=621" target="_blank">00:10:21.500</a></span> | <span class="t">They're doing the first three percent of salary at 100%, and then the next three percent at 50%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=630" target="_blank">00:10:30.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Is that a trend?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=631" target="_blank">00:10:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So the most common match is still 50 on six.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=635" target="_blank">00:10:35.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, that has started to not be as prominent as it once was, but it is still the most common</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=640" target="_blank">00:10:40.360</a></span> | <span class="t">match formula.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=640" target="_blank">00:10:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">The second most is the type of formula that you're describing right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=645" target="_blank">00:10:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that would be 100 on the first three, 50 on the next two.</span></div><div

get a four percent employer match.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=653" target="_blank">00:10:53.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But then the next three most common after that are 100 on six, 100 on five, and 100 on four.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=659" target="_blank">00:10:59.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So I would say generally, I mean, there are other, I would say, you know, multi-tier matching</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=665" target="_blank">00:11:05.320</a></span> | <span class="t">formulas out there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=852" target="_blank">00:14:12.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So 61% of all the plans offer auto-enrollment.</span></div><div class="c"><span

target="_blank">00:14:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So when you look at our plans that offer an auto-enrollment design, 94% of employees participate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=884" target="_blank">00:14:44.540</a></span> | <span class="t">When you look at our plans that have a voluntary enrollment, where essentially employees would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=890" target="_blank">00:14:50.060</a></span> | <span class="t">need to take the

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=899" target="_blank">00:14:59.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think what's interesting is, hey, if we go back 20 years to, you know, right before</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=904" target="_blank">00:15:04.020</a></span> | <span class="t">the Pension Protection Act in

now, and now the average plan participation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=923" target="_blank">00:15:23.060</a></span> | <span

if you look at the voluntary enrollment plans, their participation rates are still pretty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=933" target="_blank">00:15:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">much kind of right in line with where they used to be 20 years ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

target="_blank">00:15:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">usually pretty strong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=948"

contributions in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=961" target="_blank">00:16:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, that first

rates start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=976" target="_blank">00:16:16.420</a></span> | <span class="t">to increase around year 4,

there's also an increase cap.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1012" target="_blank">00:16:52.760</a></span> | <span class="t">First of all, explain what a default automatic increase is and then what a default automatic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1017" target="_blank">00:16:57.980</a></span> | <span class="t">increase rate is and then what a cap is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1020" target="_blank">00:17:00.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Absolutely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1020" target="_blank">00:17:00.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So when a plan has an auto-enrollment design, they initially will set a default automatic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1026" target="_blank">00:17:06.680</a></span> | <span class="t">enrollment rate, which is essentially the rate that you'll go in at.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1029" target="_blank">00:17:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Initially, when a lot of auto-enrollment designs were created, 3% was certainly the most common.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1036" target="_blank">00:17:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And what we have seen is a shift towards higher default rates.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1040" target="_blank">00:17:20.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So now, over 60% of plans now default in at a rate of at least 4% or more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1046" target="_blank">00:17:26.200</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, 30% of plans default in at 6% or more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1049" target="_blank">00:17:29.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And our research has shown that, you know, if you default someone in at a 3, 4, 5, or 6%</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1054" target="_blank">00:17:34.540</a></span> | <span class="t">default rate, even looking at it by income, you're going to have very similar opt-out rates.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1059" target="_blank">00:17:39.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's, you know, a lot of plan sponsors are thinking about ways to set that default at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1063" target="_blank">00:17:43.700</a></span> | <span class="t">at least at that maximum match rate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1065" target="_blank">00:17:45.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you have a match that's 50 on 6, hey, let's default in at 6.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1068" target="_blank">00:17:48.340</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:17:53.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, the default automatic increase rate, about 70% of plans that offer auto-enrollment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1081" target="_blank">00:18:01.160</a></span> | <span class="t">also automatically enroll workers into an annual escalation

increase every year up to a set cap by a plan sponsor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1094" target="_blank">00:18:14.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this way, you're going to, let's say, you're going to get defaulted in at 6.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1097" target="_blank">00:18:17.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And the next year, you're automatically going to get bumped up to 7%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1100" target="_blank">00:18:20.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, certainly, employees can, you

of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1104" target="_blank">00:18:24.260</a></span> | <span class="t">We'll see some employees go in and just say, hey, from day one, they want to just save 10%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1108"

workers save about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1116" target="_blank">00:18:36.600</a></span> | <span class="t">20% to 30% more within the first three years of saving compared to just those plans that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1121" target="_blank">00:18:41.400</a></span> | <span class="t">have an auto-enrollment design.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1124" target="_blank">00:18:44.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, the default auto-increase cap is, let's say, you're a plan sponsor and you have that annual escalation feature.</span></div><div

say, all right, we're going to default you up to, let's say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1138" target="_blank">00:18:58.760</a></span> | <span class="t">when you get to 10%, we're going to stop you, or we're going to get 12% or 15%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1143" target="_blank">00:19:03.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's going to be essentially a cap.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1145" target="_blank">00:19:05.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, you know, most plan sponsors would allow participants to set a higher cap if they would like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1149" target="_blank">00:19:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">or a

participants to that 12% to 15%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1166" target="_blank">00:19:26.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And that would include the employer match.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1169" target="_blank">00:19:29.720</a></span> | <span

get into the demographics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1172" target="_blank">00:19:32.340</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, who is actually taking advantage of this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1174" target="_blank">00:19:34.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And here we have some interesting data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1176" target="_blank">00:19:36.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And you break it down by income, age, gender, job tenure, how many years they've been at each company.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1185" target="_blank">00:19:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's talk about income first.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1187" target="_blank">00:19:47.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Very clearly, people with higher incomes have higher participation rates.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1195" target="_blank">00:19:55.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And the lowest income have actually declined in the last few years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1200" target="_blank">00:20:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's look at that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1204" target="_blank">00:20:04.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So, yes, when we start to look at it by income, clearly those that are earning, I would say, the highest amount have very strong participation rates.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1214" target="_blank">00:20:14.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And they have remained, you know, I would say, very strong throughout.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1218" target="_blank">00:20:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, you will start to see the last couple of years some of the lower income participation rates start to decrease.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1225" target="_blank">00:20:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I would really say that's just more of a change in business for us with, you know, having a couple of maybe a couple of larger plans that had a lot of lower income workers that are no longer in the data right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1242" target="_blank">00:20:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, I see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1242" target="_blank">00:20:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So it could be just an issue with the data, not really the fact that, say, nationwide, people who have lower incomes are participating at a lower rate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1252" target="_blank">00:20:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">No, I mean, especially as we look at, you know, the aggregate numbers, I mean, they're still very, very strong overall.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1258" target="_blank">00:20:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And I would also say, you know, especially within How America Saves, some of those lower income segments, you know, at the end of the day, there's not a lot of employees in there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1268" target="_blank">00:21:08.460</a></span> | <span class="t">The median income for the employees and participants in our data samples in like the $80,000 to $90,000 range.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1275" target="_blank">00:21:15.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, very good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1278" target="_blank">00:21:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, the next thing is age.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1280" target="_blank">00:21:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And here you would expect, well, I mean, again, auto enrollment is probably going to help this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1287" target="_blank">00:21:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But again, we have lower participation rates for those who are less than 25 years old.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1295" target="_blank">00:21:35.740</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, just coming into the workforce, which I would think should be higher because of auto enrollment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1302" target="_blank">00:21:42.200</a></span> | <span class="t">You could have plans that are of a voluntary enrollment that just have a lot more younger workers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1308" target="_blank">00:21:48.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's really kind of what leads to those overall lower numbers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1313" target="_blank">00:21:53.340</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, if you look at it, when you break it down by voluntary and auto enrollment, for those workers under 25, if their plan offers an auto enrollment design, 90%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1325" target="_blank">00:22:05.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Of those younger workers participate compared to just 25% in a voluntary enrollment design.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1331" target="_blank">00:22:11.940</a></span> | <span class="t">That is a huge difference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1333" target="_blank">00:22:13.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Absolutely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1334" target="_blank">00:22:14.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Especially when you think about just the power of compounding and, you know, what those first few years in your early 20s, what those dollars could look like in retirement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1342" target="_blank">00:22:22.780</a></span> | <span class="t">That makes a huge difference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1344" target="_blank">00:22:24.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Huge difference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1345" target="_blank">00:22:25.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And that 25% voluntary is significantly lower than, you know, pretty much any of the other age cohorts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1350" target="_blank">00:22:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Most of the other age cohorts are, you know, in the 60s and 70s percent, as you would expect overall.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1355" target="_blank">00:22:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But yeah, but the auto enrollment does an incredible job, as I mentioned before, with lower tenured and younger participants.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1364" target="_blank">00:22:44.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the next category is gender, men, women, or you have male, female.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1370" target="_blank">00:22:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">It's about the same.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1371" target="_blank">00:22:51.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's been about the same every year that you looked at this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1374" target="_blank">00:22:54.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Men are not participating more than women.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1377" target="_blank">00:22:57.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Women are not participating more than men.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1378" target="_blank">00:22:58.600</a></span> | <span class="t">It seems pretty equal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1380" target="_blank">00:23:00.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Overall, the numbers are very equal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1382" target="_blank">00:23:02.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But when you start to look at it by income, one of the things that we highlight in How America Saves is that at most income groups, women do have higher participation rates than men.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1394" target="_blank">00:23:14.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, that's not a significant difference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1396" target="_blank">00:23:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But, for example, if you look at everyone that earns between $75,000 and $100,000, 91% of women participate compared to 86% of men.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1407" target="_blank">00:23:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, when you look at the highest pay, those earning over $150,000, 96% of women participate compared to 94% of men.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1415" target="_blank">00:23:35.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what we see here really, though, is that, unfortunately, these numbers get all averaged out just because of the income gap.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1425" target="_blank">00:23:45.400</a></span> | <span class="t">There just happen to be more men that are in those higher income brackets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1429" target="_blank">00:23:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So when you start to look at men by income, while women are participating higher than men at most income segments, because there are more men in the higher income segments that just usually and typically have overall higher participation rates, the averages turn out to be about the same.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1445" target="_blank">00:24:05.620</a></span> | <span class="t">The last category is tenure, how many years you've been on the job.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1450" target="_blank">00:24:10.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And here we see people who have been on the job for one year or less have a lower participation rate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1459" target="_blank">00:24:19.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And as they increase their tenure to two to three years, four to five years, it increases.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1467" target="_blank">00:24:27.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm going to guess maybe, I'm speculating here, maybe the participation rate at the one year or less level is lower because some of these plans do not have immediate vesting of the employer's side.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1486" target="_blank">00:24:46.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Does that have any validity to it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1487" target="_blank">00:24:47.940</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, the main cause really is auto enrollment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1491" target="_blank">00:24:51.940</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, if you look at those workers that have less than two years of tenure in an auto enrollment design, 90% are participating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1500" target="_blank">00:25:00.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Those all workers with less than two years of tenure in a voluntary, only 40% are participating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1508" target="_blank">00:25:08.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So there is a 50 percentage point gap.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1510" target="_blank">00:25:10.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, those in an auto enrollment are twice as, more than twice as likely to be participating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1515" target="_blank">00:25:15.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's really kind of what's at the end of the day driving that overall tenure number to be a little lower.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1520" target="_blank">00:25:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you see anything in the data that says that not doing immediate vesting of the employer match or the employer contribution is causing people to not or to decline auto enroll in the first year or so?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1537" target="_blank">00:25:37.080</a></span> | <span class="t">We have not found any correlation between vesting schedules and participation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1543" target="_blank">00:25:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, perfect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1544" target="_blank">00:25:44.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Figure 30 is startling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1547" target="_blank">00:25:47.240</a></span> | <span class="t">It shows the huge difference on an income level, on an age level, on a job tenure level, breaks it down between participants who will sign up under auto enroll versus participants who would voluntarily sign up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1569" target="_blank">00:26:09.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's startling, the difference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1572" target="_blank">00:26:12.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, we think about, you know, essentially modern plan design, the development of just more plans offering auto enrollment has been absolutely, you know, I would say the biggest driver in helping workers prepare for retirement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1588" target="_blank">00:26:28.260</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, even just in speaking with, you know, a lot of HR professionals, you know, a lot of them will say, you know, hey, you know, our employees, they greatly appreciated this because it might not have been something they were even, you know, maybe even thinking about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1602" target="_blank">00:26:42.300</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, they might be two or three years into their career and then all of a sudden, like, wow, like this has really kind of grown into, you know, a nice, you know, starting retirement savings account.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1612" target="_blank">00:26:52.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, as we think about more plans offering it, plans are continuing to improve the design of their auto enrollment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1619" target="_blank">00:26:59.820</a></span> | <span class="t">They're also more likely to offer immediate eligibility.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1622" target="_blank">00:27:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">They're increasing employer contributions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1624" target="_blank">00:27:04.940</a></span> | <span class="t">All of these really are great steps to help workers prepare for retirement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1630" target="_blank">00:27:10.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Because at the end of the day, as you mentioned at the beginning, I mean, 401k plans really are the prominent vehicle that workers are using to save for retirement right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1639" target="_blank">00:27:19.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the more that, you know, employees can make it easy and have a really strong design, the better off workers are going to be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1649" target="_blank">00:27:29.700</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, and it's also important to think about just the workforce in general today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1652" target="_blank">00:27:32.540</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, you know, one of the advantages of defined contribution plans are they are portable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1658" target="_blank">00:27:38.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, with a lot of workers changing jobs more frequently, you know, the typical worker is probably going to have maybe nine or ten employers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1665" target="_blank">00:27:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">They change jobs about every four years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1667" target="_blank">00:27:47.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Having auto enrollment with immediate eligibility and strong defaults helps to maintain those strong savings habits through job changes, you know, versus, you know, if your plan has a voluntary enrollment design,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1681" target="_blank">00:28:01.060</a></span> | <span class="t">like as the data shows, over half of workers in their first two years never take the steps to sign up for that 401k plan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1688" target="_blank">00:28:08.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But having an auto enrollment design that has that strong default at the employer match rate, you know, essentially can kind of help.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1695" target="_blank">00:28:15.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And with that annual escalation feature, again, it's, you know, how quickly can you get workers saving that 12 to 15 percent?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1701" target="_blank">00:28:21.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And the more employers that start to, you know, offer this, the better off overall retirement readiness will be for workers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1708" target="_blank">00:28:28.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm going to pivot here for a second.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1710" target="_blank">00:28:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">What do you think about these TikTok people who are telling their listeners, 401k plans are a sham.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1720" target="_blank">00:28:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Don't put your money in them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1722" target="_blank">00:28:42.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Put your money into this insurance product that I offer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1728" target="_blank">00:28:48.140</a></span> | <span class="t">I would say, I mean, if you think about 401k plans, the tax advantage standpoint of them, as well as just the ability to, for most plans, get those additional employer contributions to be able to have a, you know, a fun lineup that is well diversified.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1745" target="_blank">00:29:05.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And there is nothing easier than contributing to a 401k plan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1750" target="_blank">00:29:10.360</a></span> | <span class="t">It comes right out of your paycheck.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1751" target="_blank">00:29:11.780</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, it is an incredibly easy and it is, is definitely, it's standing the test of time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1758" target="_blank">00:29:18.100</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a very professional answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1760" target="_blank">00:29:20.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Now I want you to really tell me what you think about these TikTok people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1763" target="_blank">00:29:23.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I will have no comment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1767" target="_blank">00:29:27.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just absolutely criminal that these people are out there saying that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1774" target="_blank">00:29:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I can say that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1775" target="_blank">00:29:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1775" target="_blank">00:29:35.960</a></span> | <span class="t">You're not going to say it, but I'm going to say, I mean, it's criminal that these people are up there on TikTok telling young people, don't participate in your 401k.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1781" target="_blank">00:29:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Instead, buy a expensive high commission insurance product through me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1785" target="_blank">00:29:45.980</a></span> | <span class="t">You're going to be better off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1786" target="_blank">00:29:46.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So I know you can't say it, but I can say it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1789" target="_blank">00:29:49.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I've seen a lot of things, a lot of financial advice that is out there on social media.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1794" target="_blank">00:29:54.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And I would, you know, just probably say buy or be aware for a while.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1797" target="_blank">00:29:57.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Fair enough.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1798" target="_blank">00:29:58.660</a></span> | <span class="t">All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1799" target="_blank">00:29:59.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's get into the Roth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1800" target="_blank">00:30:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So a lot of 401k plans are offering a Roth option for their employees to put money into.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1810" target="_blank">00:30:10.180</a></span> | <span class="t">How many plans are offering that as a percentage and what's the participation rate?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1815" target="_blank">00:30:15.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Sure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1816" target="_blank">00:30:16.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So the majority of plans are offering Roth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1818" target="_blank">00:30:18.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So as of last year, 86% of all retirement plans are offering Roth contributions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1823" target="_blank">00:30:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Thinking about some of the provisions here with Secure 2.0, you know, starting in 2026, higher paid employees, if they want to contribute to catch-ups, those contributions are going to have to be made in Roth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1836" target="_blank">00:30:36.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So I would anticipate that that 86% of plans is going to get pretty close to 100% by next year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1841" target="_blank">00:30:41.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, what we're also seeing is just the overall usage continue to increase as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1847" target="_blank">00:30:47.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So last year, an all-time high, 18% of all participants who had access to a Roth account were contributing to Roth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1855" target="_blank">00:30:55.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, as you start to, you know, kind of look at it by, you know, the demographics that we've been referencing here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1861" target="_blank">00:31:01.940</a></span> | <span class="t">it typically is the higher paid participants as well as even some of the younger participants have some stronger Roth adoption rates there as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1871" target="_blank">00:31:11.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And soon you will be able to, as an employee, you'll be able to opt to have the employer contribution also go into your Roth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1883" target="_blank">00:31:23.960</a></span> | <span class="t">When does that take effect?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1884" target="_blank">00:31:24.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So right now we are actually seeing a lot of plan sponsors look at just simply offering that Roth in-plan conversion feature.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1893" target="_blank">00:31:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So in this case, you know, you can at any point take any of those dollars, whether they are your own employee contributions or their employer contributions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1903" target="_blank">00:31:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and you can convert them to Roth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1905" target="_blank">00:31:45.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And so as of last year, 36% of plans offered a Roth in-plan conversion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1914" target="_blank">00:31:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And we've really kind of seen that start, a lot of conversations increase more recently.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1920" target="_blank">00:32:00.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Just, I think just because of the Secure 2.0 provisions, I think, you know, Roth has started to become a popular topic with a lot of employers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1929" target="_blank">00:32:09.880</a></span> | <span class="t">A lot of sponsors are really just kind of thinking about ways just to kind of set their employees up for success with regards to Roth</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1935" target="_blank">00:32:15.300</a></span> | <span class="t">and just allowing these Roth in-plan conversions in that way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1937" target="_blank">00:32:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, at any point in any time, they can just say, hey, you know what, I want to, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1942" target="_blank">00:32:22.620</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe even work with a financial advisor to figure out when that most opportune time might be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1946" target="_blank">00:32:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">As they, you know, get closer to retirement, they can start to just convert those dollars right over.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1952" target="_blank">00:32:32.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So instead of asking the employees, do you want your employer match or employer contribution to go into a traditional account pre-tax or the Roth,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1966" target="_blank">00:32:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">all they're saying to them is, well, look, we're going to put it in your traditional side, but you can convert it anytime you want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1972" target="_blank">00:32:52.660</a></span> | <span class="t">However, when you do convert it, of course, it's a taxable event.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1975" target="_blank">00:32:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Exactly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1976" target="_blank">00:32:56.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And you're going to be paying income tax on that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1978" target="_blank">00:32:58.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1978" target="_blank">00:32:58.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1979" target="_blank">00:32:59.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So I see how they're addressing this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1981" target="_blank">00:33:01.480</a></span> | <span class="t">What about after-tax contributions to 401k?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1986" target="_blank">00:33:06.460</a></span> | <span class="t">You maxed out your contribution as an employee, and you want to make after-tax contributions up to the limit of the total amount that could be put into the 401k.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=1997" target="_blank">00:33:17.060</a></span> | <span class="t">What percentage of plans offer that, and what's the participation rate?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2000" target="_blank">00:33:20.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Sure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2001" target="_blank">00:33:21.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So 24% of plans offer traditional after-tax.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2006" target="_blank">00:33:26.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So these are contributions that, like you said, after you reach that 402k limit, now your pre-tax and all Roth contributions fall under that 402k limit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2015" target="_blank">00:33:35.560</a></span> | <span class="t">But after you've reached that, you can contribute to after-tax accounts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2020" target="_blank">00:33:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And when offered, about 10% of participants use them, and it's typically going to be your higher income workers that would be taking advantage of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2030" target="_blank">00:33:50.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you also may have some plans that, hey, once you reach that 402k limit and you start contributing after-tax, they can do sort of an auto-convert to Roth on those contributions right when they come in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2041" target="_blank">00:34:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Almost sort of like that automatic Roth in-plan conversion to kind of take advantage of those additional tax benefits of the money being in Roth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2049" target="_blank">00:34:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Using industry jargon, you could do an automatic mega-backdoor Roth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2055" target="_blank">00:34:15.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Correct, yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2056" target="_blank">00:34:16.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And then that way, you're essentially kind of going up, with your employer contributions, going up to that 415k limit, which is certainly much significantly higher than the 402k limit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2064" target="_blank">00:34:24.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, very good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2066" target="_blank">00:34:26.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's talk about account values.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2068" target="_blank">00:34:28.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And here, there's no surprise, obviously, the longer you work, the more you put money into your 401k, the greater your account values are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2079" target="_blank">00:34:39.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And I don't think there's anything really in the data that is surprising here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2084" target="_blank">00:34:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, and I would say as of last year, I mean, we did have all-time highs with average and median balances within How America Saves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2091" target="_blank">00:34:51.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, certainly a lot of those account balances are driven by the market.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2094" target="_blank">00:34:54.340</a></span> | <span class="t">I'd also say that, you know, even with auto-enrollment, we're having just that many more new accounts kind of get brought in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2100" target="_blank">00:35:00.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, as I review a lot of the data on How America Saves, account balance is one that I don't typically talk about as much just because, at the end of the day, we're just kind of looking at, for most workers, perhaps just a portion of their retirement assets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2117" target="_blank">00:35:17.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, this, for the most part, these are just the balances of where someone has with their current 401k plan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2122" target="_blank">00:35:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, we know most participants may have prior 401ks, they have IRAs, their spouse has retirement assets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2128" target="_blank">00:35:28.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, I think what can start to become more impactful, though, is we've been talking a lot about plan design.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2134" target="_blank">00:35:34.460</a></span> | <span class="t">What we did this year is we looked at plans that offer auto-enrollment versus voluntary enrollment and account balances.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2142" target="_blank">00:35:42.120</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, we see overall the median balance for someone that's in an auto-enrollment or a voluntary enrollment very similar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2149" target="_blank">00:35:49.900</a></span> | <span class="t">But then when we start to look at it by tenure, what we have found is that for those longer-tenured participants,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2157" target="_blank">00:35:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and in this case we'll say everyone that has more than 10 years of job tenure, the median balance for those workers in an auto-enrollment plans is about 60% higher than those longer-tenured workers in a voluntary enrollment design.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2172" target="_blank">00:36:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reason is because those auto-enrollment participants have essentially been saving since day one, where those voluntary enrollment participants probably didn't start until year four, five, or six.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2181" target="_blank">00:36:21.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so as we start to think about, you know, just the impact that auto-enrollment can have on just overall balances and retirement readiness,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2186" target="_blank">00:36:26.820</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it was – this is, you know, definitely a very strong point to highlight is that, you know, as you just think about those longer employees that have been there, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2195" target="_blank">00:36:35.340</a></span> | <span class="t">getting them in the plan on day one, they are going to essentially have balances that are about 60% higher than they would have otherwise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2202" target="_blank">00:36:42.180</a></span> | <span class="t">All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2203" target="_blank">00:36:43.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Now for the remainder of the time, we're going to talk about investing, how people are investing, and we're going to talk about the returns.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2208" target="_blank">00:36:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I think kind of fascinating what's going on here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2211" target="_blank">00:36:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So first off is asset allocation, you know, basically how the money is diversified in different types of funds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2223" target="_blank">00:37:03.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And there has been a increasing allocation quite largely to target date funds and decreasing allocation to just diversified equity funds and also a decreasing allocation to, looks like, company stock.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2247" target="_blank">00:37:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Just describe these trends in general.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2249" target="_blank">00:37:29.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, we think about the overall asset allocation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2253" target="_blank">00:37:33.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So 42% of all assets, you know, across the, you know, 1400 plans on our record-keeping platform, 42% of those assets are in target date funds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2262" target="_blank">00:37:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And that is up from 26% 10 years ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2267" target="_blank">00:37:47.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, a lot of that really is driven by just increasing contributions over time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2272" target="_blank">00:37:52.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, as we think about 64% of all new money last year, all contributions were going into target date funds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2280" target="_blank">00:38:00.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So essentially about two out of every $3 being contributed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2283" target="_blank">00:38:03.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, certainly auto-enrollment has played a part in this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2289" target="_blank">00:38:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, as we look at auto-enrollment designs, you know, about 70% of participants that are in an auto-enrollment design are in a professionally managed allocation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2301" target="_blank">00:38:21.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, when I talk about professionally managed allocations, this is any participant who is a pure target date fund investor, meaning they have 100% of their assets in one target date fund or balanced fund.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2313" target="_blank">00:38:33.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Or they're in an in-plan managed account advice solution.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2317" target="_blank">00:38:37.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So at the end of last year, 67% of all participants at Vanguard were in a professionally managed allocation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2326" target="_blank">00:38:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So two out of every three.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2327" target="_blank">00:38:47.580</a></span> | <span class="t">We've made an incredible amount of progress in just helping workers not just get in saving at a strong level, but also defaulting them into an, you know, age-appropriate, well-diversified portfolio.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2342" target="_blank">00:39:02.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I do want to highlight one thing on asset allocation that you have in here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2348" target="_blank">00:39:08.260</a></span> | <span class="t">It says the average participant-weighted asset allocation to equities was 78% in 2024.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2356" target="_blank">00:39:16.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And in the report, you comment that, and I quote,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2359" target="_blank">00:39:19.900</a></span> | <span class="t">In the past, higher-income participants tended to assume more equity market risk on average than lower-income participants.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2368" target="_blank">00:39:28.140</a></span> | <span class="t">However, with the rising adoption of target date funds and automatic enrollment, participants of all income segments now have similar equity risk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2379" target="_blank">00:39:39.340</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that's really important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2382" target="_blank">00:39:42.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Absolutely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2382" target="_blank">00:39:42.780</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, if you look at participants who are in a professionally managed allocation, the lower-income participants are more likely to be in it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2392" target="_blank">00:39:52.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So actually, on figure 78, you'll see lower-income workers, over three-quarters of them are in a professionally managed allocation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2400" target="_blank">00:40:00.060</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, when you go back 20 years ago before, you know, target dates became so popular, you know, most retirement plans defaulted workers in to a money market or a stable value fund.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2412" target="_blank">00:40:12.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And think about it as the time of voluntary enrollment, so workers needed to, you know, essentially sign up for their 401K plan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2418" target="_blank">00:40:18.740</a></span> | <span class="t">They needed to figure out how much they were going to save.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2421" target="_blank">00:40:21.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And then after they arrived at that savings rate then, you know, they would typically be given, you know, a list of, you know, maybe 15 to 20 different mutual funds of varying asset classes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2432" target="_blank">00:40:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and asked to, you know, kind of put together a, you know, well-diversified portfolio that was age-appropriate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2440" target="_blank">00:40:40.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think there may have been a lot of participants that were like, you know what, I'm just going to go with this default.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2445" target="_blank">00:40:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, it's a money market.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2448" target="_blank">00:40:48.040</a></span> | <span class="t">It pays X number of interest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2450" target="_blank">00:40:50.740</a></span> | <span class="t">I understand this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2451" target="_blank">00:40:51.700</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm just going to do this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2452" target="_blank">00:40:52.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I think as what we have found, as more sponsors are just going with these targeted funds defaults, they have really become, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2461" target="_blank">00:41:01.060</a></span> | <span class="t">the main investment vehicle for retirement plan savers right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2465" target="_blank">00:41:05.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And the overall improvements, especially, I would say, for younger workers, has been astounding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2471" target="_blank">00:41:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, as we're kind of talking about this, I'll share my favorite figure in the entire book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2478" target="_blank">00:41:18.100</a></span> | <span class="t">It's figure 84.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2480" target="_blank">00:41:20.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And in this figure here, I think it's very impactful to kind of show that, you know, back in 2005,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2487" target="_blank">00:41:27.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the average equity allocation for someone in their 20s was around 50%, 60%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2492" target="_blank">00:41:32.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And now in 2024, it's up to about 90%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2499" target="_blank">00:41:39.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, the average equity allocation line pretty much looks like your typical target day glide path.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2504" target="_blank">00:41:44.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, this is all participants.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2506" target="_blank">00:41:46.020</a></span> | <span class="t">You go back to, you know, 2005, and it wasn't as though everyone was at that 50%, 60%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2513" target="_blank">00:41:53.500</a></span> | <span class="t">That's just the average.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2514" target="_blank">00:41:54.720</a></span> | <span class="t">You had about a quarter of participants that had no equity, and you had about a quarter of those in their 20s that had high equity,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2521" target="_blank">00:42:01.380</a></span> | <span class="t">and they essentially were kind of meeting in the middle at that average.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2523" target="_blank">00:42:03.780</a></span> | <span class="t">But as you can see now, just with the introduction of target date funds in plan managed account advice,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2530" target="_blank">00:42:10.280</a></span> | <span class="t">it has drastically improved the age-appropriate equity allocations of participants.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2538" target="_blank">00:42:18.740</a></span> | <span class="t">I will say that in looking at the data, there seems to be a line in the sand somewhere around age 50,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2545" target="_blank">00:42:25.300</a></span> | <span class="t">where if you're under age 50, you have a much more higher probability of having all of your 401K in a target date fund,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2553" target="_blank">00:42:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and if you're over the age of 50, there's a lower probability.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2557" target="_blank">00:42:37.700</a></span> | <span class="t">We've talked about that two-thirds of participants that are professionally managed allocation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2561" target="_blank">00:42:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, so, you know, a lot may ask, hey, what about the other third?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2565" target="_blank">00:42:45.640</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, how are they kind of constructing their portfolios?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2569" target="_blank">00:42:49.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And really what we have found is a lot of it is kind of dependent upon age.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2575" target="_blank">00:42:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So if we look at younger workers, in this case, let's just say less than 35, younger than age 35,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2582" target="_blank">00:43:02.300</a></span> | <span class="t">82% of them are in a professionally managed allocation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2585" target="_blank">00:43:05.020</a></span> | <span class="t">For the 18% that are not, the vast majority of them have about 80% to 100% in equity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2591" target="_blank">00:43:11.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So they're essentially kind of, you know, within that ballpark.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2594" target="_blank">00:43:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Only 3% have, I would say, lower than 80% in equity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2598"

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2605" target="_blank">00:43:25.860</a></span> | <span class="t">but for those that aren't, the vast majority of them, I would say, are in at least that 60% to 100% range of having,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2611" target="_blank">00:43:31.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I would say, an age-appropriate allocation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2613" target="_blank">00:43:33.580</a></span> | <span class="t">But when we look at older participants, what we have found in this case, we're just going to say age 55 and older,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2619" target="_blank">00:43:39.780</a></span> | <span class="t">only about half of them are in a professionally managed allocation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2622" target="_blank">00:43:42.540</a></span> | <span class="t">But when you start to look at how the other half are investing, their equity exposure is actually fairly dispersed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2630" target="_blank">00:43:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">We actually do highlight this separately in How America Saves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2634" target="_blank">00:43:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, what we show is that, you know, you essentially have participants that are older that have zero equity,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2641" target="_blank">00:44:01.100</a></span> | <span class="t">and you have older participants that have 100% equity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2644" target="_blank">00:44:04.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's fairly dispersed across the full equity exposure spectrum.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2648" target="_blank">00:44:08.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I'd also note that, you know, those sort of, you know, quote-unquote do-it-yourself investors,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2653" target="_blank">00:44:13.460</a></span> | <span class="t">they tend to have the highest average and medium balances, you know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2657" target="_blank">00:44:17.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So you start to think, like, hey, for a lot of those older participants, they were most likely hired before target dates.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2662" target="_blank">00:44:22.980</a></span> | <span class="t">They've been kind of DIYing it themselves for their entire career.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2667" target="_blank">00:44:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So you think about the typical participant that might be using a target date fund or in an advice solution,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2673" target="_blank">00:44:33.580</a></span> | <span class="t">they're going to probably be more in that 40% to 70% equity range if they're, you know, those older participants.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2680" target="_blank">00:44:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I will also say that I am an advisor by trade that once people get assets outside of their retirement plan,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2693" target="_blank">00:44:53.860</a></span> | <span class="t">let's say they have personal savings, that for tax purposes, you might do an allocation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2701" target="_blank">00:45:01.940</a></span> | <span class="t">that might put more of the fixed income into the 401k or maybe international stocks which have high dividends into the 401k</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2711" target="_blank">00:45:11.540</a></span> | <span class="t">versus into a taxable account for the purpose of reducing taxable income that comes in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2718" target="_blank">00:45:18.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I mean, there's lots of different reasons later on as you get older.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2722" target="_blank">00:45:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">To have something that is a different allocation than what a target date fund might have you in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2727" target="_blank">00:45:27.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Absolutely, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2729" target="_blank">00:45:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">No, there certainly could be very, you know, thoughtful, meaningful reasons on why some of these participants may be at those extremes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2735" target="_blank">00:45:35.720</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, when you start to see dispersed and sort of, you know, you know, I would say this structured and dispersed,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2741" target="_blank">00:45:41.160</a></span> | <span class="t">you just start to get concerned that there could be some portfolio construction errors for some participants in that segment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2750" target="_blank">00:45:50.820</a></span> | <span class="t">You talked about this managed portfolio because we're going to get into the returns here in a little bit of target date funds versus do-it-yourself versus these managed portfolios.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2762" target="_blank">00:46:02.940</a></span> | <span class="t">What do you mean by exactly by managed portfolios?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2766" target="_blank">00:46:06.700</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, okay, so we know what target date funds are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2769" target="_blank">00:46:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">We know what balanced funds are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2771" target="_blank">00:46:11.720</a></span> | <span class="t">We know what do-it-yourself is with individuals who are just picking funds from the menu of funds that are available.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2778" target="_blank">00:46:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, what do you mean by managed accounts?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2780" target="_blank">00:46:20.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, who is managing these accounts, and are they getting paid for managing these accounts?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2783" target="_blank">00:46:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a great question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2785" target="_blank">00:46:25.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And, yeah, so there are about half of plans at Vanguard also offer an in-plan advice service,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2793" target="_blank">00:46:33.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and they can either choose to have that through Vanguard or through a third party.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2800" target="_blank">00:46:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And essentially, these participants are handing keys to the car over to an investment professional to take care of everything for them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2809" target="_blank">00:46:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And that way, they can essentially start to build in all of their personal risk tolerances.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2815" target="_blank">00:46:55.380</a></span> | <span class="t">They can start to build in, you know, hey, what do my other assets look like?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2819" target="_blank">00:46:59.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And really kind of start to put together, you know, essentially an advised portfolio construction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2826" target="_blank">00:47:06.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, what we have found is that larger plans are definitely more likely to offer this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2833" target="_blank">00:47:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So 82% of our larger plans at Vanguard offer participants an in-plan managed account service.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2840" target="_blank">00:47:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And I would say overall, when offered, you know, close to 10% of participants do take advantage of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2848" target="_blank">00:47:28.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Last part that I want to talk about today is returns.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2853" target="_blank">00:47:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Fascinating, actually, when I dig into this, because that's my background.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2857" target="_blank">00:47:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I spent years calculating returns on client portfolios, which is, by the way, why I became an index advocate way, way back 30 years ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2866" target="_blank">00:47:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm looking at one of your figures that talks about the returns, time-weighted versus dollar-weighted.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2876" target="_blank">00:47:56.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is basically the question about, are these plan participants trading to try to do some market timing?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2882" target="_blank">00:48:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And the way that you could always determine that is by looking at the time-weighted return,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2887" target="_blank">00:48:07.860</a></span> | <span class="t">which has nothing to do with when money comes in and out of a fund,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2890" target="_blank">00:48:10.460</a></span> | <span class="t">and the dollar-weighted return, which has to do with when people are putting money in funds and when they're taking them out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2896" target="_blank">00:48:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And I want to highlight the five-year number.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2898" target="_blank">00:48:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So on average, overall, this is all of your plans.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2903" target="_blank">00:48:23.860</a></span> | <span class="t">The five-year number ending in 2024, the compounded annualized time-weighted return was 8% compounded.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2913" target="_blank">00:48:33.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And the compounded dollar-weighted return, which would take into consideration market timing and so forth, was also 8%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2923" target="_blank">00:48:43.700</a></span> | <span class="t">People are remarkably disciplined about how they invest their 401k money in order for that number to come up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2932" target="_blank">00:48:52.020</a></span> | <span class="t">That is a very great call-out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2934" target="_blank">00:48:54.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And absolutely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2935" target="_blank">00:48:55.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, as we look at the data from last year, only 5% of participants made any type of an investment exchange.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2943" target="_blank">00:49:03.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And in this case, I'm just referring to, you know, moving dollars from fund A to fund B.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2948" target="_blank">00:49:08.200</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, when you go back, again, 20 years before target date funds,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2952" target="_blank">00:49:12.220</a></span> | <span class="t">close to 20% of participants were trading in their 401k plans.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2956" target="_blank">00:49:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And what we have found is that there's a correlation between single target date fund usage and decreasing exchange activities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2966" target="_blank">00:49:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So as we have found more and more participants becoming pure target date fund investors, overall exchange activity has decreased.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2975" target="_blank">00:49:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, for example, if we look back last year in 2024, everyone who started the year as a pure target date fund investor,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2984" target="_blank">00:49:44.360</a></span> | <span class="t">only 1% of them made an exchange in their account versus, I believe it was 11% of all of the sort of do-it-yourself investors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=2993" target="_blank">00:49:53.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is, I mean, it's really even held up through a lot of periods of severe market volatility.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=3000" target="_blank">00:50:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, even as we look at some of the data from 2025, you know, we had the periods March and April when the markets fell significantly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=3009" target="_blank">00:50:09.860</a></span> | <span class="t">We looked at the data here through sort of mid-year, only 3% of participants have made an exchange.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=3016" target="_blank">00:50:16.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's pretty much in line to where we were at this point last year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=3021" target="_blank">00:50:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So, yeah, I mean, as, you know, Jack Bogle would always, you know, kind of say one of the main principles of investing is stay the course.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=3028" target="_blank">00:50:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And we're definitely seeing that with the way the participants are handling their investment allocations and retirement plans.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=3037" target="_blank">00:50:37.060</a></span> | <span class="t">I will go to another aspect of the data that you collected.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=3041" target="_blank">00:50:41.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And here we're looking at the average five-year dollar-weighted return.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=3048" target="_blank">00:50:48.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So how people actually did.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=3050" target="_blank">00:50:50.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Of those who are in single target date funds, those who were in managed accounts, you know, professionally managed, or advised,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=3063" target="_blank">00:51:03.740</a></span> | <span class="t">and those who were doing it themselves, and it's almost exactly the same, with the exception of a lot more dispersion of returns within the managed accounts and certainly within the individual do-it-yourself investors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=3079" target="_blank">00:51:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So the average is the same across those three categories.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=3085" target="_blank">00:51:25.740</a></span> | <span class="t">But the dispersion gets wider and wider as you go to a managed account.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=3091" target="_blank">00:51:31.780</a></span> | <span class="t">The dispersion of the returns are many more higher, many more lower.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=3095" target="_blank">00:51:35.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you go to the individual accounts, and you've got even a much, much wider.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=3099" target="_blank">00:51:39.140</a></span> | <span class="t">But the median of all that is almost identical.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=3103" target="_blank">00:51:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, absolutely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=3104" target="_blank">00:51:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And, yeah, as you start to think, I mean, if you think about your target date fund suite, and then from there moving to a managed account,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=3110" target="_blank">00:51:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">so those managed account participants, because of the personalized nature of that service,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=3116" target="_blank">00:51:56.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you will start to see a little bit more dispersion in those returns, which is really just driven by their equity exposure,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=3124" target="_blank">00:52:04.120</a></span> | <span class="t">especially, you know, for some younger participants, if, let's say, they were going to be a 90% equity in target date funds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=3129" target="_blank">00:52:09.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And through advice, maybe they're going to increase that a little bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=3132" target="_blank">00:52:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">They want to take a little bit more risk because of stronger returns here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=3135" target="_blank">00:52:15.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Over the last five years, they're going to have a little bit of a wider dispersion with managed accounts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=3140" target="_blank">00:52:20.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And then when you start to look at the do-it-yourself participants, you're going to have some that are 100% equity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=3146" target="_blank">00:52:26.740</a></span> | <span class="t">On the flip side, you're going to have some that have no equity at all, and you're really going to run the whole spectrum there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=3152" target="_blank">00:52:32.440</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's really kind of coming down to is the returns for those that are really high, is that, you know, really, you know, based on skill,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=3162" target="_blank">00:52:42.540</a></span> | <span class="t">or is that maybe more based on luck, as I would say?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=3166" target="_blank">00:52:46.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I mean, the dispersion is randomness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=3170" target="_blank">00:52:50.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, you went all the way from the middle, the median is around 8%, but, you know, some people only compounded at 2.2.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=3176" target="_blank">00:52:56.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Some people compounded at 13.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=3179" target="_blank">00:52:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then even the way, way outliners are even taken out of this, like the 95 percentile.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=3186" target="_blank">00:53:06.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Is that what this is?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=3187" target="_blank">00:53:07.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=3188" target="_blank">00:53:08.440</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, a target date fund works just fine in your 401k or even in your IRA.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=3196" target="_blank">00:53:16.780</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a very good investment option if the target date fund is extremely low cost, meaning an indexed target date fund rather than an actively managed target date fund where the fees might be significantly higher.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=3210" target="_blank">00:53:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So I recommend them, even to a lot of clients who are in their 50s or 60s, if they're in a 401k or 403b, a 457,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=3219" target="_blank">00:53:39.340</a></span> | <span class="t">and I say, let's see if there are low cost target date funds available, because often there are, and often they fit right into the client's investment strategy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=3230" target="_blank">00:53:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then with the selection of that fund, often we look past the year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=3234" target="_blank">00:53:54.980</a></span> | <span class="t">The year doesn't really mean that much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=3236" target="_blank">00:53:56.940</a></span> | <span class="t">What we're looking for is the asset allocation of the fund.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=3240" target="_blank">00:54:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So if we want a fund that has 80 percent equity, it doesn't matter what the year is, and then adjust down the road as the glide path takes over.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=3251" target="_blank">00:54:11.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's not always about the target date being the date that you're going to retire.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=3255" target="_blank">00:54:15.980</a></span> | <span class="t">The target date is simply the name of the fund and the fund itself underlying is the asset allocation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=3262" target="_blank">00:54:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Is this what you're looking for?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=3264" target="_blank">00:54:24.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Does this fit what you're trying to do?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=3266" target="_blank">00:54:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And if it does, it doesn't matter if it's a 2020 fund, a 2040 fund, or a 2060 fund.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=3271" target="_blank">00:54:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, that's the fund that you use, and then you make adjustments later.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=3275" target="_blank">00:54:35.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Make sense?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=3276" target="_blank">00:54:36.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Absolutely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=3278" target="_blank">00:54:38.260</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, when you start to think about the benefits of target date funds, certainly you want to look at cost matter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=3283" target="_blank">00:54:43.960</a></span> | <span class="t">You want to look at, you know, what those fees are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=3286" target="_blank">00:54:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">When we look at the advantages that they have on age-appropriate allocations, they're well diversified.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=3293" target="_blank">00:54:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">You have the benefits of continual rebalancing, which in volatile markets can be beneficial.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=3298" target="_blank">00:54:58.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, as we mentioned, they are really helping participants stay the course with their investments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=3304" target="_blank">00:55:04.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So they have done an incredible job, especially as they really have come on as, you know, the main default.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=3310" target="_blank">00:55:10.340</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, the vast majority of all retirement plans now are defaulting employees in to target date funds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802pqCtLurw&t=3316" target="_blank">00:55:16.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Jeff, I want to thank you for being on Bogle Heads on
