You can see Einstein growing up Jewish in Germany. You can see Jennifer Doudna growing up as an outsider, or Leonardo da Vinci, or Elon Musk in really violent South Africa with a psychologically difficult father and getting off the train when he goes to anti-apartheid concert with his brother. And there's a man with a knife sticking out of his head, and they step into the pool of blood, and it's sticky on their souls. This causes scars that last the rest of your life. And the question is not, how do you avoid getting scarred? It's, you know, how do you deal with it? The following is a... It's a conversation with Walter Isaacson, one of the greatest biography writers ever, having written incredible books on Albert Einstein, Steve Jobs, Leonardo da Vinci, Jennifer Doudna, Benjamin Franklin, Henry Kissinger, and now a new one on Elon Musk. We talked for hours on and off the mic. I'm sure we'll talk many more times. Walter is a truly special writer, thinker, observer, and human being. I highly recommend... I highly recommend people read his new book on Elon. I'm sure there will be short-term controversy, but in the long term, I think it will inspire millions of young people, especially with difficult childhoods, with hardship in their surroundings or in their own minds, to take on the hardest problems in the world and to build solutions to those problems, no matter how impossible the odds. In this conversation, Walter and I cover all of his books and use personal stories from them, to speak to the bigger principles of striving for greatness in science, in tech, engineering, art, politics, and life. There are many things in the new Elon book that I felt are best saved for when I speak to Elon directly again on this podcast, which will be soon enough. Perhaps it's also good to mention here that my friendships, like with Elon, nor any other influence like money, access, fame, power, will ever be forgotten. I'm sure that you will find that there is no other way to live your life. I'm sure that you will find that there is no other way to live your life. result in me sacrificing my integrity, ever. I do like to celebrate the good in people, to empathize and to understand, but I also like to call people out on their bullshit, with respect and with compassion. If I fail, I fail due to a lack of skill, not a lack of integrity. I'll work hard to improve. This is the Lex Friedman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Walter Isaacson. What is the role of a difficult childhood in the lives of great men and women, great minds? Is it a requirement? Is it a catalyst? Or is it just a simple coincidence of fate? Well, it's not a requirement. Some people with happy childhoods who do quite well. But it certainly is true that a lot of really driven people are driven because they're harnessing the demons of their childhood. Even Barack Obama's sentence in his memoirs, which is, I think every successful man is either trying to live up to the expectations of his father or live down the sins of his father. And for Elon, it's especially true because he had both a violent and difficult childhood and a very psychologically problematic father. He's got those demons dancing around in his head. And by harnessing them, it's part of the reason, that he does riskier, more adventurous, wilder things than maybe I would ever do. You've written that Elon talked about his father and that at times it felt like mental torture, the interaction with him during his childhood. Can you describe some of the things you've learned? Yeah, well, Elon and Kimball would tell me that, for example, when Elon got bullied on the Playboy, he was on the playground and one day was pushed down some concrete steps and had his face pummeled so badly that Kimball said, "I couldn't really recognize him." And he was in the hospital for almost a week. But when he came home, Elon had to stand in front of his father and his father berated him for more than an hour and said he was stupid and took the side of the person who had beaten him. That's probably one of the more traumatic events of Elon's life. Yes. And there's also Veld School, which is a school that's a little bit more complex. And there's also the Veld School, which is a school that's a little bit more complex. And there's also the Veld School, which is a school that's a little bit more complex. And there's also the Veld School, which is a school that's a little bit more complex. And there's also Veld School, which is a sort of paramilitary camp that young South African boys got sent to. And at one point, he was scrawny. He has very bad at picking up social cues and emotional cues. He talks about being Asperger's. And so he gets traumatized at a camp like that. But the second time he went, he'd gotten bigger. He had shot up to almost six feet and he'd learned a little bit of judo. And he realized that if he was getting beaten up, he'd be beaten up. He might hurt him, but he would just punch the person in the nose as hard as possible. So that sense of always punching back has also been ingrained in Elon. I spend a lot of time talking to Errol Musk, his father. Elon doesn't talk to Errol Musk anymore, his father, nor does Kimball. It's been years. Errol doesn't even have Elon's email. So a lot of times, Errol will be sending me emails. And Errol had one of those Jekyll and Hyde personalities. He was a great mind of engineering and especially material science. He knew how to build a wilderness camp in South Africa using mica and how it would not conduct the heat. But he also would go into these dark periods in which he would just be psychologically abusive. And, of course, May Musk says to me, his mother, who divorced Errol early on, said, the danger for Elon is that he becomes his father. And every now and then, you've been with him so much, Lex, and you know him well. He'll even talk to you about the demons, about Diablo dancing in his head. I mean, he gets it. He's self-aware. But you've probably seen him at times where those demons take over and he goes really dark and really quiet. And Grimes says, you know, I can tell a minute or two in advance when demon mode's about to happen. And he'll go a bit dark. I was, you know, here at Austin, wanted dinner with a group. And you could tell suddenly something had triggered him and he was going to go dark. I've watched it in meetings where somebody will say, we can't make that part for less than $200. Or, no, that's wrong. And he'll berate that. And then he snaps out of it. As you know that, too. The huge snap out where suddenly he's showing you a Monty Python skit on his phone and he's joking about things. So I think coming out of the childhood, there were just many facets, maybe even many personalities. The engineering mode, the silly mode, the charismatic mode, the visionary mode, but also the demon and dark mode. A quote you cited about Elon really stood out to me. I forget who it was from. But inside the man. The man. He's still there as a child. The child standing in front of his dad. That was Tallulah, his second wife. And she's great. She's an English actress. They've been married twice, actually. And Tallulah said that's just him from his childhood. He's a drama addict. Kimball says that as well. And I asked why. And Tallulah said, you know, for him, love and family are kind of. Associated with those psychological torments. And in many ways, he'll channel. I mean, Tallulah would be with him in 2008 when the company was going bankrupt, whatever it may have been or later. And he would be so stressed, he would vomit. And then he would channel things that his father had said, use phrases his father had said to him. And so she told me deep inside the man is this man child still standing. And I said, yeah. He's not being in front of his father. To what degree is that true for many of us, do you think? I think it's true, but in many different ways. I'll say something personal, which is I was blessed. And perhaps it's a bit of a downside, too. With the fact that I had the greatest father you could ever imagine. And mother. They were the kindest people you'd ever want to meet. I grew up in a magical place in New Orleans. My dad was an engineer, an electrical engineer. And, you know, he was always. Kind. Perhaps I'm not quite as driven or as crazed. I don't have to prove things. So I get to write about Elon Musk. I get to write about, you know, Einstein or Steve Jobs or Leonardo da Vinci, who, as you know, was totally torn by demons and had different difficult childhood situations, not even legitimized by his father. So sometimes those of us who are lucky enough to have relationships. Really gentle, sweet childhood. We grow up with fewer demons, but we grow up with fewer drives. And we end up maybe being Boswell and not being Dr. Johnson. We end up being the observer, not being the doer. And so I always respect those who are in the arena. I don't, you know. You don't see yourself as a man in the arena. I've had a gentle, sweet career. And I've got to cover really interesting people. But I've never shot off a rocket that might someday get to Mars. I've never moved us into the era of electric vehicles. I've never stayed up all night on the factory floor. I don't have quite those, either the drives or the addiction to risk. I mean, Elon's addicted to risk. He's addicted to risk. He's addicted to adventure. Me, if I see something that's risky, I spend some time calculating, okay, upside, downside here. But that's another reason that people like Elon Musk get stuff done. And people like me write about the Elon Musks. One other aspect of this, given a difficult childhood, whether it's Elon or DaVinci, I wonder if there's some wisdom, some advice almost that you can draw, that you can give to people with difficult childhoods. I think all of us have demons, even those of us who grew up in a magical part of New Orleans with sweet parents. Yes. And we all have demons. And rule one in life is harness your demons. Know that you're ambitious or not ambitious, or you're lazy or whatever. And Leonardo DaVinci knew he was a procrastinator. I think it's useful to know what's eating at you, know how to harness it. Also know what you're good at. I'll take Musk as another example. I'm a little bit more like Kimball Musk than Elon. I maybe got over endowed with the empathy gene. And what does that mean? Well, it means that I was okay when I ran Time Magazine. It was a group of about 150 people on the editorial floors, and I knew them all, and we had a jolly time. When I went to CNN, I was not very good at being a manager or an executive of an organization. I cared a little bit too much that people didn't get annoyed at me or mad at me. And Elon said that about John McNeil. He was the president of Tesla, for example, who was president of Tesla. It's in the book. I talked to John McNeil a long time. And he says, you know, Elon just would fire people, be really rough on people. He didn't have the empathy for the people in front of him. And Elon says, yeah, that's right. And John McNeil couldn't fire people. He cared more about pleasing the people in front of him than pleasing the entire enterprise or getting things done. Being over endowed with the desire to please people can make you less tough of a manager. And that doesn't mean there aren't great people who are over endowed. Ben Franklin? Over endowed with the desire to please people. The worst criticism of him from John Adams and others was that he was insinuating, which kind of meant he was always trying to get people to like him. But that turned out to be a good thing. When they can't figure out the big state, little state issues, the Constitutional Convention, when they can't figure out the Treaty of Paris, whatever it is, he brings people together and that is his superpower. So to get back to the lessons you asked, and, you know, the first was harness your demons. The second is to know your strengths and your superpower. My superpower is definitely not being a tough manager. After running CNN for a while, I said, okay, I think I've proven I don't look tough. I don't really enjoy this or know how to do this well. You know, do I have other talents? Yeah, I think I have the talent to observe people really closely, to write about it in a straight but I hope interesting narrative style. That's a power. It's totally different from running an organization. It took me until three years of running CNN that I realized I'm not cut to be an executive in highly intense situations. Elon Musk is cut to be an executive in highly intense situation, so much so that when things get less intense, when they actually are making enough cars and rockets are going up and landing, he thinks of something else so he can surge and have more intensity. He's addicted to intensity. And that's his superpower, which is a lot greater than the superpower of being a good observer. I think also to build on that, it's not just addiction to risk and drama. There's always a big mission above it. So I would say it's an empathy towards people in the big picture. It's an empathy towards humanity more than the empathy towards the three or four humans who might be sitting in the conference room with you. And that's a big deal. You see that in a lot of people. You see it, Bill Gates, Larry Summers, Elon Musk. They always have empathy for these great goals of humanity. And at times, they can be clueless about the emotions of the people in front of them, or callous sometimes. Musk, as you said, is driven by mission more than any person I've ever seen. And it's not only mission. It's like cosmic missions, meaning he's got three really big missions. One is to make humans a space-faring civilization, make us multi-planetary, or get us to Mars. Number two is to bring us into the era of sustainable energy, to bring us into the era of electric vehicles and solar roofs and battery packs. And third is to make sure that we're not just a bunch of people who are going to be in the same boat, but we're also going to be in the same boat. And I think that's the key.

And I think that's the key. And I think that's the key. And I think that's the key. And as you know, there's a scene in there that says that there's a theory about the universe that if anybody ever discovers the secrets of meanings of the universe, it will be replaced by an even more complex universe. And then the next line Douglas Adams writes is, there's another theory that this has already happened. So I'm not sure I get my head around that, but I know that Elon Musk tries to. Well, there's a humor to that. There's an enormous humor to that. There's an enormous humor to Hitchhiker's Guide. And I really think that helped Musk out of the darkest of his periods to have sort of the sense of fun of figuring out what life is all about. I wonder if this is a small aside we could say, just having gotten to know Elon very well, like his, the silliness, the willingness to engage in the absurdity of it all and have fun. What is that? Is that just a quirk of personality or is that a fundamental aspect? Is that just a quirk of personality or is that a fundamental aspect? Of a human who's running six plus companies? Of a human who's running six plus companies? Well, it's a relief valve, just like video games and Polytopia and Elden Ring are release valves for him. And he does have an explosive sense of humor, as you know. And the weird thing is when he makes the abrupt transition from dark demon mode and you're in the conference room and he has really become upset about something. Not only their dark vibes, but there's dark words emanating and he's saying your resignation will be accepted if you don't, you know, etc. And then something pops and he pulls out his phone and pulls up a Monty Python skit, you know, like the School of Silly Walks or whichever John Cleese it was. And then he starts laughing again and things break. So it's almost as if he has different modes. The emulation of human mode, the engineering mode, the dark and demon mode, and certainly there is the silly and giddy mode. Yeah, you've actually opened the Elon book with quotes from Elon and from Steve Jobs. So Elon's quote is, "To anyone I've offended, I just want to say," this is on SNL, "I just want to say I reinvented electric cars and I'm sending people to Mars on a rocket ship. Did you also think I was going to be a chill, normal dude?" And then the quote from Steve Jobs, of course, is, "The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do." So what do you think is the role of the old madness and genius? What do you think is the role of crazy in this? Well, first of all, let's both stipulate that Musk is crazy at times. And then let's figure out, and I try to do it through storytelling, not through highfalutin preaching, where that craziness works. You know, give me a story. Tell me an anecdote. Tell me where he's crazy. And, you know, the almost final example, AI, but him shooting off Starship for the first time. In between an aborted countdown and the shoot-off, he goes to Miami. And he's like, "I'm going to go to the moon." And then he shoots off. He goes to Miami to an ad sales conference and meets Linda Iaccarino for the first time, makes her the CEO. I mean, there's a very impulsiveness to him. Then he flies back. They launch Starship. And you realize that there's a drive and there are demons and there's also craziness. And you sometimes want to pull those out. You want to take away his phone so he doesn't tweet at 3:00 a.m. You want to, say, quit being so crazy. But then you realize there's a wonderful line of Shakespeare in Measure for Measure at the very end. He says, "Even the best are molded out of faults." And so you take the faults of Musk, for example, which includes a craziness that can be endearing but also craziness that's just like effing crazy. As well as this drive and demon. I don't know that you can take that strand out of the fabric and the fabric remains whole. I wonder, sometimes it saddens me that we live in a society that doesn't celebrate even the darker aspects of crazy in acknowledging that it all comes in one package. It's the man in the arena versus the critic. And the man in the arena versus the regulator to make it more prosaic. Well, let me ask about not just the crazy but the cruelty. So, you've written one reporting on Steve Jobs. Woz told you that the big question to ask was, did he have to be so mean, so rough and cruel, so drama addicted? What is this answer for Steve Jobs? Did he have to be so cruel? For Jobs? I asked Woz at the end of my reporting. Because that's what he said at the beginning. We're doing the launch of, I think, the iPad 2, it may have been. Steve is emaciated because, you know, he's been sick. And so I say to Woz, what's the answer to your question? And he said, well, if I had been running Apple, I would have been nicer to everybody. Everybody got stock options. We've been like a family. And then I, I don't know if you know Woz, he's like a teddy bear. He paused. He smiled and he said, but if I had been running Apple, I don't think we would have done the Mac and Tits. Or the iPhone. So, yeah, you have to sometimes be rough. And Jobs said the same thing that Musk said to me. Which is he said, people like you love wearing velvet gloves. Now, I don't know that I've worn velvet gloves often. But you like people to like you. You like to sweet talk things. You sugarcoat things. He says, I'm just a working class kid. And I don't have that luxury. If something sucks, I got to tell people it sucks. Or I got a team of B players. Well, Musk is that way as well. And it gets back to what I said earlier. Which is, yeah, I probably would wear velvet gloves if I could find them at my haberdasher. And I do try to sugarcoat things. But when I was running CNN, it needed to be reshaped. It needed to be broken. It needed to have certain things blown up. And I didn't do it. So, bad on me. But it made me realize, okay, I'll just write about the people who can do it. Well, that thing of saying, I think probably both of them, but Elon certainly, saying things like that is the stupidest thing I've ever heard. By the way, I've heard Jeff Bezos say that. I've heard Bill Gates say that. I've heard Steve Jobs say it. I've heard Steve Jobs say it about a smoothie. They were making it a whole food or something. People, they use the word stupid. They use the word stupid really often. And you know who else used it? Errol Musk. He kept making Elon stand in front of him and saying, that's the stupidest thing. You're the stupidest person. You'll never amount to anything. I don't know. You know, as John McNeil, the president of Tesla said, do you have to be that way? Probably not. There are a lot of successful people who are much kinder. It's sometimes necessary to be much more brutal and honest, brutally honest, I would say, than people like, who win boss of the year trophies. Well, as you said, this kind of idea did also send a signal. This idea of Steve Jobs of A players, it did send a signal to everybody. It was a kind of encouragement to the people. It was a kind of encouragement to the people that are all in. Right. And that happened to Twitter. When we went to Twitter headquarters the day before the takeover, he was having Andrew and James, his two young cousins, and other people from the autopilot team, going over lines of code. And Musk himself sat there with a laptop on the second floor of the building, looking at the lines of code that had been written by Twitter engineers. And they decided they were going to fire 85% of them. Because they had to be all in. And this notion of psychological safety and mental days off and working remotely. He said either. And then it came up, actually one of his, I think it was one of the cousins or maybe Ross Nordin came up with the idea of let's not be so rough and just fire all these people. Let's ask them, do you really want to be all in? Because this is going to be hardcore. It's going to be intense. You get to choose. But by minimum, you're going to be all in. You're going to be all in. You're going to be all in. You're going to be all in. You're going to be all in. You're going to be all in. You're going to be all in. You're going to be all in.

You're going to be all in. You're going to be all in. You're going to be all in. You're going to be all in. You're going to be all in. It's pretty well a given. Everybody is like a Mark Jankosa, just whip smart. It's are you hardcore and all in? Especially if you're going to have to move to this spit of a town in the south tip of Texas called Boca Chica, you got to be all in. Yeah. And that's the drive, the last piece. So you, in terms of collaborating, one of the great teams of all time, Ben Franklin. I like that. I thought it was the Beatles, but Ben Franklin is pretty good. Oh, no, no, no. I'm sorry. I'm sorry to offend you so deeply. Read the Constitution and read Abbey Road. Listen to Abbey Road. They're both good, but they're in a different league. Yeah, different league. Okay. So one of the many things that comes to mind with Ben Franklin is incredible time management. Is there something you could say about Ben Franklin and about Steve Jobs? I think interesting with Elon is that he, as you write, runs six companies. Seven, I mean, it depends how you count. Starlink is its own thing. I don't know. What can you say about these people in terms of time management? Well, Musk is in a league of his own in the way he does it. First of all, Steve Jobs had to run Pixar and Apple for a while. But Musk, every couple of hours, is switching his mindset from how to implant the neural link chip. What will the robot that implants it in the brain look like and how fast can we make it move? And then the heat shield on the Raptor or switching to human imitation, machine learning, full self-drive. On the night that the Twitter board agreed to the deal, this is huge around the world. I'm sure you remember, like Musk buys Twitter. It wasn't when the deal closed. It was when the Twitter accepted it. He accepted his offer. And I thought, okay. But then he went to Boca Chica, to South Texas, and spent time fixating on, if I remember correctly, a valve in the Raptor engine that had a methane leak issue. And what were the possible ways to fix it? And all the engineers in that room, I assume, are thinking about, this guy just bought Twitter. Should we say something? And then he goes with Kimball to a roadside joint in Brownsville and just sits in the front and listens to music with nobody noticing really him being there. One of the things that's one of his strengths and weaknesses in a way is in a given day, he'll focus serially, sequentially on many different things. He'll worry about uploading video onto x.com or the payment system, and then immediately switch over to some issue with the FAA giving a permit for Starship or with how to deal with Starlink and the CIA. And when he's focused on any of these things, you cannot distract him. It's not like he's also thinking about dealing with the internet. He's thinking about dealing with Starlink, but I've got to also worry about the Tesla decision on the new $25,000 car. Now he'll, in between these sessions, process information, then let off steam. And for better or worse, he lets off steam by either playing a friend in Polytopia or fire off some tweets, which is often not a healthy thing, but it's a release for him. And he does it. I once said he was a great multitasker, and that was a mistake. People corrected me. He's a serial tasker, which means focuses intensely on a task for an hour, almost has a, what do they call it at restaurants where they give you a palate cleanser. He does some palate cleanser with Polytopia and then focuses on the next task. Is there some wisdom about time management that you can draw from that? There's some things that these people do. And you say, okay, I can be that way. I can be more curious. I can question every rule and regulation. I just don't think anybody should try to emulate Musk's time management style because it takes a certain set of teams who know how to deal with everything else other than the thing he's focusing on and a certain mind that can shift just like his moods can shift. You and I go through transitions. And also if I'm thinking about what I'm going to say on this podcast, I'm also thinking about the email my daughter just sent about a house that she's looking at. And I'm multitasking. He doesn't actually do that. He single tasks sequentially with a focus that's hardcore. I don't know. I think there's wisdom to draw from that. First of all, he makes me, Ben Franklin makes me feel that way that there's a lot of hours in the day. There's a lot of minutes in the day. There's no excuse not to get a lot done. And that requires just an extreme focus. An extreme focus and an urgency. I think the fierce urgency that drives him is important. And it's sometimes ginned up. Like I say, the fierce urgency of getting to Mars and on a Friday night at the launchpad, in Boca Chica at 10:00 PM. There are only a few people working because it's a Friday night. They're not supposed to launch for another eight months. And he orders a surge. He says, "I want 200 people here by tomorrow working on this pad." We have to have a fierce sense of urgency or we will never get to Mars. That sense of urgency is also a vibrancy that's really taking on life fully. I mean, to me, this is a lesson is like even the mundane can be full of this just richness. And you just have to really take it in intensely. So the switching enables that kind of intensity because most of us can't hold that intensity in any one task for a prolonged period of time. Maybe that's also a lesson. Right. And I guess it goes back to also know who you are. Know who you are. Meaning there are people who... Know who you are. ...can focus intensely and there are people who can see patterns across many things. Look, Leonardo da Vinci, he was not all that focused. He was easily distracted. Procrastinate. It's why he has more unfinished paintings than finished paintings in his canon. But his ability to see patterns across nature and to, in some ways, process, procrastinate, be distracted. That helped him some. But Musk is not that way. And every few months, there's a new surge. You don't know where it'll be, but you'll be on solar roofs and all of a sudden, we'll have a surge and there has to be 100 solar roofs built or this has to be done by tomorrow or make a starship dome by dawn and surge and do it. And there are people who are built that way. It is inspiring. But also, let's appreciate that there are people who can be really good, but also can savor the success, savor the moment, savor the quiet sometimes. Musk's big failing is he can't savor the moment or success. And that's the flip side of hardcore intensity. Yeah. Yeah. And I think that's the thing. I think that's the thing. And I think that's the thing. And I think that's the thing. And I think that's the thing. And I think that's the thing. And I think that's the thing. And I think that's the thing. And I think that's the thing. And I think that's the thing. And I think that's the thing. And I think that's the thing. And I think that's the thing. And I think that's the thing. And I think that's the thing. And I think that's the thing. And I think that's the thing. And I think that's the thing. And I think that's the thing. And I think that's the thing. And I think that's the thing. And I think that's the thing. He said, "When I was a professor at Harvard, I thought that history was determined by great forces and groups of people. But when I see it up close, I see what a difference an individual can make." He's talking about Sadat and Golda Meir, probably talking about himself too, or at least in his mind. And we biographers have this dirty secret that we know. We distort history a bit by making the narrative too driven by an individual. But sometimes it is driven by an individual. Musk is a case like that. And sometimes, as I did with the innovators, there's teams and people who build on each other. And Gordon Moore and Bob Noyce then getting Andy Grove and doing the microchip, which then comes out. And Wozniak and Jobs find it at some electronics store and they decide to build the Apple. And so sometimes there are flows of... There are flows of forces and groups of people. I guess I err a little bit on the side of looking at what a Steve Jobs and Elon Musk and Albert Einstein can do. And I also try to figure out if they hadn't been around, would the forces of history and the groups of people have done it without them? That's a good historical question as somebody who loves history. And you think about special relativity, one of the 1905 papers. Even after he writes it, it's four years before people truly get what he's saying, which is, it's not just how you observe time is relative, it's time itself is relative. And on the general theory, which he does a decade later, I'm not sure we would have gotten that yet. What about moving us into the era of an iPhone in which it's so beautiful that you can't live without a thousand songs in your pocket, email. The internet in your pocket and a phone. There are a lot of brain dead people from Panasonic to Motorola who didn't get that and it may have been a while. I certainly think it's true of the era of electric vehicles. Jim and Ford, all the great people there, they crushed the boat. And I mean that literally. They ended up smashing them because they decided to discontinue it. Likewise, nobody was sending up rockets. Our space shuttle was about to be grounded. 12 years ago. And so Musk does things and there'll be people who say and read the book, well, if they read the book, they'll see the full story. Well, they'll say it wasn't Musk who did Tesla, it was Martin Eberhard or Mark Tarpening. No, no, no. There were people who had helped create the shells of companies and other things and they were all deserved to be called co-founders, but the guy who actually gets us to a million electric vehicles a year is Elon Musk. And without him, I don't think we... Look, if anybody five years from now buys a car that's gasoline powered, we'll think that's quaint, that's odd. I mean, suddenly we've changed. We're not going to do it. 90% of that is Elon Musk. We're all mortal. When and how do you think Elon will retire from the insanely... Productive schedule he's on now? I would think that he would hate to retire. I think that he can't live without the pressure, the drama, the all-in feeling. It's never been anything that seemed to have crossed his mind. He's never said, "Maybe I love Larry Ellison's house on the beach in Hawaii. Maybe I should spend time in doing." Instead, he says things like, "I learned early on that vacations will kill you." He gets malaria when he goes on one... I mean, he goes on vacation at one point and they oust him from PayPal. And then he goes to Africa at one point, he gets malaria. He says, "I've learned, vacations kill you." Lesson learned. Well, it's interesting because the projects are 100 plus year projects, many of these. One of the weird things is watching him think incredibly long term. One of the meetings every week early on when I was watching him was Mars colonizer. And we did through a two-hour meeting about what would the governance structure be on Mars? What would people wear? How would the robots work? And would there be democracy or should there be a different form of governance? I'm sitting there saying, "What are they doing?" What are they talking about? I mean, they're trying to build rocket ships and everything else. They are worrying about the governance structure of Mars. And likewise, whenever he's in a tense moment, like there's a rocket that's about to be launched, he'll start asking people something in the way future, like the new lead engine or something. If we're going to build that, do we have enough materials ready to order? Or I don't know. He'll just ask questions. Like when he's building RoboTaxi, the global car, the $25,000 inexpensive global car, that's not a total passion. He was talked into doing that. His passion is RoboTaxis. But his passion is how are we going to make this factory to do a million cars a year? So even the RoboTaxi is a longer range vision. I mean, he's been touting it since 2016. But we're not. I don't know. RoboTaxis, I mean, Waymo may be doing a little experiment. But there's not cars being manufactured without steering wheels that are going to take over the highways. Yeah, so he's always looking way into the future is my point. I just hope that there's a lot of Da Vinci's and Steve Jobs' and Einstein's and Elon Musk's that carry the flame forward. That's one of the reasons you write books about these. These people is so that if you're a young woman in a school where you're not being told to do science and you read the code breaker about Jennifer Doudna, you say, "Okay, I can be that." And when you say, "Oh, maybe I'll be a regulator," or you say, "Oh, no, maybe I'll be the person who pushes the boundaries, who pushes the lines, who pushes," as Steve Jobs said, "the human race." Well, let me ask you about your mind. You're a genius. Your process. I'll give you two out of three. All right. Take me through your process of writing a biography. I mean, the full of it. And not just writing a biography, but understanding deeply, which your books have done for the human story and the bigger ideas underlying the human story. So you've written biographies both of individuals, which are hardly individuals. It's a really big, complex picture. And biographies of ideas that involve individuals. Well, step one for me is trying to figure out how the mind works. What causes Einstein to make that leap? Elon Musk? To say stainless steel while he's looking at a carbon fiber rocket. Or how do you make the mental leap? Because I write about smart people. But smart people are a dime a dozen. They don't usually amount to much. You have to be creative, imaginative to think different, as Jobs would say. And so what makes people creative? What makes them take imaginative leaps? That's the key question you got to ask. You also ask the questions like you've asked earlier, which is what demons are jangling in their head and how do they harness them into drives? So you look at all that and you try to observe really carefully the person. And then you look at the other person, and you say, "Well, that's a different person. That's a different person." And then you say, "Well, that's not the person." And you look at the other person, and you say, "Well, that's the person." And then you say, "Well, that's the person." And then you say, "Well, that's not the person." And then you say, "Well, that's not the person." And then you say, "Well, that's the person." And then you say, "Well, that's the person." And then you say, "Well, that's the person." And then you say, "Well, that's the person." And then you say, "Well, that's the person." And then you say, "Well, that's the person." types come out, preachers, storytellers. Be a storyteller. I try, whenever I'm trying to convey a thought, there's six magic words that I almost should have written on a card penned above my desk, which is, let me tell you a story. So if somebody says, how does Elon Musk figure out good talent? As you did, I think, well, let me tell you the story. I'll tell you the story of Jake McKenzie. Or this is not something I invented. I mean, this is the way the good Lord does it in the Bible. I mean, has the best opening lead sentence ever, you know, in the beginning, comma, and then it's stories. And secondly, to pick up on that lead sentence in the beginning, make it chronological. Everybody in the the 40th year of their life has grown from the 39th year and the 38th year. And so you want to show how people evolve and grow. I had the greatest of all nonfiction narrative editors, Alice Mayhew at Simon Schuster, who, among other things, created all the president's men with Woodward and Bernstein. But she had a note she'd put in the margins of my books that was a tigta, and it meant all things in good time. Keep it chronological. If it's good enough for the Bible, it's good enough for you. Interesting. To me, like, that's a small note. But to you, it's extremely important. Because it's the framework for how you structure things, but also how you understand things, which is, if you keep it a chronological narrative, then you're showing how a person has grown from one experience you've talked about to the next one. And that moral growth, creative growth, risk taking growth, that's what you're talking about. And that's what I'm trying to get at. I'm trying to get at what's happening in the world. And I think, you know, I think that's the essence of creativity. And I think that's what I'm trying to make. And I think that's the essence of the world's world. And I think that's what I'm trying to make. And I think that's the essence of wisdom, that's the essence of creativity. But you can't do it. You know, there's a term, "building's woman," which is a book of, you know, that carries a narrative and tells how people learn something. I'm a big believer in narrative. If you're an academic, sometimes, not today, but in like 20 years ago, 30 years ago, there were two things you thought were bad. One was, you know, the fact that you were having a great person theory of history in which you decided to do biography. I had a great professor when I was in college. Her name was Doris Kearns. She later married Dick Goodwin. And she, when she was going for tenure at the university, wrote a biography of Lyndon Johnson and the American Dream. And they denied her tenure because it was beneath the dignity of the academy to write history through one person. That's great. It opened up the field of biography to us non-academics, starting with David McCullough, Bob Caro, but maybe John Meacham and myself are in a new generation, and certainly there's a generation coming after us. But the second thing, besides telling it through people, which is the academy tended to disdain what they called imposing a narrative in which you made it storytelling, because that meant you were leaving things out and making it into a narrative. Well, that's how we form our views of the world. Well, let me ask you this question. In terms of gathering an understanding, how much of it is one observing and how much of it is interviews? Yeah. And obviously depends on the subject. I mean, with Ben Franklin, it's all based on archives and every, of course, we have 40 volumes of letters he wrote. That was a good old days when every day you'd write 20 letters. The Musk book is based much more on observation than almost any of my books because he opened up in a way that was breathtaking to me. Even when he'd be sitting playing Polytopia or something, he'd be sitting there, he'd be sitting there seething at other people. He'd have me just sitting there watching. I mean, I spent a lot of time with Jennifer Dowden at her side. I went to her lab and edited a human gene with a pipette and a test tube. But I would say I spent 30 hours with her. I can't count, 100 hours or more just observing Musk. And I'm not sure that any photographer, perhaps since Boswell took on Dr. Johnson, has ever had quite as much up close, meaning five feet away at all times, access. And because of that, I'll go back to what I said a moment ago, I try to get out of the way of the story. It's not about me. I try to just say, "Okay, here's what happened. Here's this story. Here's what happened the night he came in." I just go back and listen to Twitter for the first time and let you form your own judgment. What about the interviews? You've had a lot of conversations. You give acknowledgement to the people you've done interviews with. Well, one, I have to ask, as an aspiring interviewer myself, how? People love to talk. People just love it. You know that. And I've had 140, maybe 150 people. They're all listening. Yeah. They're all listening. I'm going to go back. One of the little things that people won't notice, but I'll say it now, is all of them are on the record. Getting them to talk is easy. They all want to talk about Musk. But then at a certain point, say, "I don't put anonymous quotes in my book. I cite things." I say, "If you're tough enough and you've gone through this..." And a lot of times, it takes two or three calls back. Somebody will tell me a story, I say, "Oh, no, no, no. I don't want to." But I think it's important. It's important to know where everything came from. And with Musk, it's... I had that from the very beginning, because I was a Time Magazine reporter. I'd worked reporter for the Times Picayune on New Orleans. First day on the job, I had to go cover a murder. And I phoned in the story from a pay phone, and my editor, the city editor said, "Well, did you talk to the family?" I went, "No, Billy. I mean, the family, the daughter just got..." He said, "Go knock on the door." I knocked on the door. An hour later, they were still talking. They were bringing out her yearbook. Lesson one I learned, people want to talk if you're willing to just listen. And whether it be Henry Kissinger, you just push the button and say Kissinger, and people tell you the stories, all the way through Elon Musk, everybody talked. Everybody in his family, everybody he fired, everybody. I mean, I think it's important to listen to people. And the other thing I learned as a reporter, back when I was covering politics in New Hampshire, in the early campaigns, I learned from two or three great reporters, a guy named David Broder and Tim Russert, the late NBC guy. They do what was called door knocking. You just walk in a neighborhood, knock on a door, and ask people about the election. But they said, "Here's the secret. Don't ask any leading questions. Don't have any premise. Just say, 'Hey, I'm trying to figure out this election. What's going on? What do you think?'" Mm-hmm. And then stay silent. That's the word secret. You know this well. He'll go silent at times. Sometimes a minute, two minutes, four minutes. Don't try to fill the silences. If you're a listener, you got to learn, "Okay, he's not saying anything for four minutes. I can outlast him." It's tough. As humans, it's very tough. Respecting the silence is really, really difficult. Mm-hmm. I've, speaking of demons, when there's silence, all the demons show up in my head. Oh, dear. The fear, I think, is if I don't say anything, it's boring. And if I say something, it's going to be stupid. That's the basic engine that just keeps running, not on the podcast, but also in human interaction. And so I think there's that nervous energy when interacting with people. You can never go wrong by staying silent if there's nothing you have to say. Not something I've mastered, but I do, when I'm a reporter, try to master it. I do master that, which is don't ask complex questions. Don't interject. And when somebody hasn't fully answered the question, don't say, "Well, let me ... " Just stay silent, and then they'll keep talking. Just give them a chance to keep talking, even if they've kind of finished, still. Yeah. Sometimes, if they haven't given you enough, instead of following up, I'll just nod and keep waiting. Making it sound simple, is there a secret to getting people to open up more? I'm somewhat lucky, because I started off working for a daily newspaper, and people back then, they wanted to talk to the newspaper reporter. But you also have a way about you. I feel like you have a cowboy in a saloon. You just kind of want to talk. There's a draw to ... I don't know what it is. I don't know if as a developer you're born with it. Yeah. But it feels like I want to tell you a story of some sort. Good. Tell me a story. A couple things. I did learn to be more quiet. I'm sure I know when I was younger, or even I'll see videos of me at news things where I'm always trying to interject a question. And so, you learn to be quieter sometimes. I haven't mastered it enough. You learn to be naturally curious. Many reporters today, when they ask a question, are either trying to play gotcha, or trying to get a news scoop, or trying to gig something that can make a lead. And if you actually are curious, and you really want to know the answer to a question, then people can tell. Yeah. But you have to be curious. Yeah. And you have to be curious. Yeah. And you have to be curious. Yeah. And you have to be curious. Yeah. And you have to be curious. Yeah. And you have to be curious. Yeah. And you have to be curious. Yeah. And you have to be curious.
