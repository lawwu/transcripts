Everything expires in this world except digital stuff and the whole idea that digital information doesn't really expire can be a great thing but in some cases it also just does not allow us to let go of things and so I've been playing around with expiry.</p><p>I have this notion template which basically for all the things that are kind of these nice to haves but not need to haves, I throw them in there and then if I don't get to them over a period of time, it's basically if I don't check it as done or delete it, it'll automatically expire after a certain period that I can set and that's actually really nice because again I'm not throwing anything mission critical in here but I am throwing those things where it's like oh let me get to this and ultimately if I haven't gotten to it in let's say 30 days instead of having this wait that like sticks with me forever that just gets longer and longer and longer, this allows me to just process it.</p></div></div></body></html>
