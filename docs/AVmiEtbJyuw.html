href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=0" target="_blank">00:00:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not often that personnel changes are worth a video, but these ones are as they look set to rearrange the generative AI landscape.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=10" target="_blank">00:00:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I've read pretty much every report, article, exclusive and rumor out there on the firing of the CEO of OpenAI, Sam Altman,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=18" target="_blank">00:00:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and the resignation of the president and co-founder, Greg Brockman.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=23" target="_blank">00:00:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to try to distill the most interesting bits and cover angles that I don't think others have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=29" target="_blank">00:00:29.080</a></span> | <span class="t">But let's start with this bombshell tweet from Greg Brockman, again, the president and co-founder of OpenAI, or I should say the former president.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=37" target="_blank">00:00:37.960</a></span> | <span class="t">He said that last night Sam got a text from Ilya Sutskova, that's the chief scientist of OpenAI and a key board member, asking to talk at noon on Friday.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=47" target="_blank">00:00:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And at this point, you can tell that either Sam Altman drafted this bit or a third party, maybe a lawyer, because it goes into the third person.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=54" target="_blank">00:00:54.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Sam joined a Google meet and the whole board, except Greg himself, was there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=59" target="_blank">00:00:59.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Ilya told Sam he was being fired and that the news was going out very soon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=63" target="_blank">00:01:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">But that must have been a very short call because at 12.19pm, Greg got a text from Ilya asking for a quick call.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=70" target="_blank">00:01:10.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Firing the public face of your company, the CEO and co-founder, Sam Altman, in a 15 minute no notice Google meets call is quite a dramatic move.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=81" target="_blank">00:01:21.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Anyway, Ilya Sutskova and the board were on a roll because four minutes later, Greg Brockman was told that he was being removed from the board.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=89" target="_blank">00:01:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Interestingly, they told him he was vital to the company and he would retain his role.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'll get to OpenAI statement in a moment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=97" target="_blank">00:01:37.160</a></span> | <span class="t">It does seem, though, that literally one of the only people in the world who had any real notice was Myra Murati, the new interim CEO who found out the night prior.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Anyway, bear in mind that statement that Ilya Sutskova said that Greg Brockman was vital to the company.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And even the OpenAI blog post put it like this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.120</a></span> | <span class="t">As part of this transition, Greg Brockman will be stepping down as chairman of the board, makes it seem voluntary, and will remain in his role at the company reporting to the CEO.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">We now know that Greg Brockman had other ideas, saying, based on today's news, the firing of Sam Altman, I quit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's someone supposedly vital to the company who is no longer going to be there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=139" target="_blank">00:02:19.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, at this point, the obvious question is, well, what did Sam Altman do to get fired?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">It must have been bad enough to get fired in a no notice 15 minute Google meet call, but not so bad that Greg Brockman didn't feel the need to resign in solidarity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, there are one or two leading theories, which I'll get to in a moment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But first, what did the board say?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.240</a></span> | <span class="t">They say that his departure follows a deliberative review process by the board, which concluded that he was not consistently candid or honest in his communications with the board.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And they go on hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Their responsibility, which they later reiterate, is building safe AGI that benefits all of humanity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So they must have believed that Sam Altman not being honest hindered their ability to build safe AGI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.200</a></span> | <span class="t">They say the board no longer has confidence in his ability to continue leading open A.I.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.560</a></span> | <span class="t">The natural follow on question, therefore, becomes what wasn't he honest about?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.520</a></span> | <span class="t">It must have been something fairly dramatic that he wasn't candid about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Otherwise, you wouldn't fire the CEO, giving all of the investors literally no notice and doing it in such a way that multiple other employees have resigned, not just Greg Brockman.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">The information in an exclusive put it like this. Jacob Pachocki, the company's director of research, Alexandra Madry, head of a team evaluating potential risks from A.I.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and Simon Seidl, a seven year researcher at the startup, have told associates that they have resigned, too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.720</a></span> | <span class="t">The departures are a sign of immense disappointment among some employees and underscore long simmering divisions at the chat GPT creator about A.I. safety practices.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And don't forget, those aren't just any employees.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Jacob Pachocki is the GPT for lead and director of research, or he was.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have the guy responsible for the pre-training of GPT for resigning and the vital Greg Brockman resigning to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Will there even be a viable open A.I. after this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, yes, according to many people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'll get to that in a second.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But what about Alexandra Madry?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, it was just in late October, about three weeks ago, when he was announced to be the head of their preparedness team.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.480</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a super important role leading the team that will help track, evaluate, forecast and protect against catastrophic risks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So it seems if this was a safety play, it's quite strange for him to resign to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Something definitely doesn't add up here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not just the safety people versus the accelerationists.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And in another exclusive from the information, apparently there was an impromptu, not prepared, all hands meeting following the firing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Ilya Sutskova took questions and at least two employees asked Sutskova this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Did the firing amount to a coup or hostile takeover?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=302" target="_blank">00:05:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The people in the room felt the question implied that Sutskova may have felt Altman was moving too quickly to commercialise the software</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and that that was at the expense of potential safety concerns.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Anyway, Sutskova replied like this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You can call it that way, Sutskova said about the coup allegation, and I can understand why you chose this word.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But I disagree with this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.240</a></span> | <span class="t">This was the board doing its duty to the mission of the non-profit, which is to make sure that OpenAI builds AGI that benefits all of humanity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.480</a></span> | <span class="t">He was then asked whether these backroom removals are a good way to govern the most important company in the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.720</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a somewhat hype claim, but nevertheless, he answered, I mean, fair.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I agree that there is not an ideal element to it, 100%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=345" target="_blank">00:05:45.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So, so far we have a notion of Altman not being totally honest about something to do with generating profits for the company that might put a risk safety.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.280</a></span> | <span class="t">It feels to me that Sutskova doesn't do niceties, hence the 15 minute firing of Altman.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And maybe he has an issue with what he perceives to be big egos.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=364" target="_blank">00:06:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">He recently tweeted this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Ego is the enemy of growth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=367" target="_blank">00:06:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">At this point, I'll note that I feel there has been some amount of bullying of other members of the board who made the decision to fire Altman.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=375" target="_blank">00:06:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">But really, it seems pretty clear that the driving force behind it was Ilya Sutskova.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So rather than blaming less experienced board members, I would direct questions towards Ilya Sutskova.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=385" target="_blank">00:06:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Anyway, Microsoft, whose stock is down almost 2% in the wake of this news, has rushed out a statement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=392" target="_blank">00:06:32.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Remember, they were given literally one minute notice of this development.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=396" target="_blank">00:06:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">The Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and CTO Kevin Scott, who were instrumental in bringing OpenAI into partnership with Microsoft, expressed utmost confidence in OpenAI following the unexpected news.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=409" target="_blank">00:06:49.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Nadella, who just two weeks ago was on stage with Altman when Altman said, "I look forward to building AGI together," put out a fairly cold statement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=417" target="_blank">00:06:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">He said, "We have a long-term agreement with OpenAI with full access to everything we need to deliver on our innovation agenda.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=425" target="_blank">00:07:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">We remain committed to our

Gemini.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=800" target="_blank">00:13:20.120</a></span> | <span class="t">That was a model rumored to be better than GPT-4.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=803" target="_blank">00:13:23.080</a></span> | <span class="t">However, in the last 48 hours, not only has it been strongly hinted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=806" target="_blank">00:13:26.680</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:13:30.840</a></span> | <span class="t">but also expectations are being damped down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=813" target="_blank">00:13:33.560</a></span> | <span class="t">The CEO of Google said, "Our goal with Gemini is to put out a state-of-the-art model,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=818" target="_blank">00:13:38.440</a></span> | <span class="t">as in better than GPT-4.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=819" target="_blank">00:13:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">That is where we're going to start with Gemini 1.0,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=823" target="_blank">00:13:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">but it's only after that that they're going to add more innovations,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=826" target="_blank">00:13:46.600</a></span> |

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=834" target="_blank">00:13:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So now the expectations are more of a model just slightly better than GPT-4,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=839" target="_blank">00:13:59.080</a></span> | <span class="t">but nothing truly revolutionary.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmiEtbJyuw&t=840" target="_blank">00:14:00.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And bear in mind that
