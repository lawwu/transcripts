Buck, can you introduce yourself? - Hello, my name is Buck Wilford. I live in Strongsville, Ohio, and I pastor at Brunswick Community Church. - And Buck, you've been reading through the LSB. You want to tell us a little bit about your experience?</p><p>- I've read entirely through the LSB last year. I do a daily Bible reading plan, and I lead my church, and about 80 people that follow me as I write devotion, but what I read each day, I'm on my second time through that this year already, and I really love the LSB.</p><p>I love the way the word slave is brought out so much, and showing as we're a servant of God, we're a slave of God. I love the way the word loving kindness is brought out so much, wherever it should be brought out, because it's one of God's biggest traits and characteristics, and I love the word Yahweh, because it brings God so personal.</p><p>Rather than just reading L-O-R-D and getting confused with Lord to Lord with capital letters, you have that personal name of God, and it draws out so much strength with it there. - Thank you so much, Buck, we appreciate it. - Thank you so much.</p></div></div></body></html>
