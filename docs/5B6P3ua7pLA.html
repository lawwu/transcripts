href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So you grew up as a teenager in Long Island in the 1990s.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And at one time, you had a dream of becoming an artist.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I thought I would grow up and do animation for Disney.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.340</a></span> | <span

growing up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I played sports and stuff, but I was not a great athlete or anything like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.700</a></span> | <span class="t">What I really loved was reading and art.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.520</a></span> | <span class="t">But somebody tapped me on the shoulder and said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.120</a></span> | <span class="t">hey, you're not technically proficient enough to become an animation artist at Disney.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, that's not where this is going.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I didn't have the technical skills that would be required for something like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So I really was unmoored coming out of high school.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I had no idea what to do with myself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.140</a></span> | <span class="t">I wasn't particularly interested in school.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that I got this anti-authority streak from my parents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.620</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not that they didn't want me to do well in school.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just that they didn't seem like overly concerned about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think I just kind of said, I'm going to do whatever I want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And it did not go well for me, as you might imagine in my teens and 20s.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">You did get your start in the industry in 1996.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Your father apparently knew somebody who played golf with who was in the brokerage industry and made the introduction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And you got a job at a brokerage firm, cold calling and getting leads for a senior broker.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So this story is not very uncommon for people in their teens or 20s in that time from where I came from, Nassau County, Long Island.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Basically, if you didn't know what to do with yourself, you became a cold caller.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And Long Island had, I was going to say thousands, but it's probably hundreds, but maybe it felt like thousands of brokerage firms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Every one of those glass office towers along Route 110 in Huntington or out in Melville, Dix Hills, Hop Hog, the North Shore of Long Island, Great Neck, all of the Northern Boulevard office towers had its own brokerage firm in it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's just what you did.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And what was cool about it was this is before the internet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And people were genuinely interested in learning about the stock market and being offered IPOs and being called by people who purportedly were from Wall Street.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So we had a very receptive audience when we would dial the phones.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was very simple.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=316" target="_blank">00:05:16.860</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, my name is Josh.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.620</a></span> | <span class="t">This is the name of my firm.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=319" target="_blank">00:05:19.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And every year we help bring between six and 12 companies public.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And the next time we're going to do that, we'd love to be able to call you and tell you about the company.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And everyone said yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's 96.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=333" target="_blank">00:05:33.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I was in Manhattan doing that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the building was 909 Third Avenue, which in the book I point out, ironically, is right next door to the lipstick building where Bernie Madoff was playing his trade.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=345" target="_blank">00:05:45.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So we thought we were the hotshots.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=348" target="_blank">00:05:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">But basically, I worked at a firm that ended up becoming notorious.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.900</a></span> | <span class="t">It was called Duke and Company.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=353" target="_blank">00:05:53.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I was 19.</span></div><div

college.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=357" target="_blank">00:05:57.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was just trying to figure out how to spend the summer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.900</a></span> | <span class="t">But

target="_blank">00:07:22.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And so when I listen to the stories of of other people who have become successful on the street, if they started in your era or my era in the 80s or 90s, no matter where they ended up, it's highly likely that among their first roles on Wall Street involved cold calling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=459" target="_blank">00:07:39.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Sure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=460" target="_blank">00:07:40.140</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, you listen to Ron Carson tell his story of selling mutual funds out of the

names of the people in the town who keep popping up in articles and that he gets himself a meeting in one building.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=485" target="_blank">00:08:05.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And after that meeting, he uses the fire stairs to go to every floor and try to meet as many people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=492" target="_blank">00:08:12.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, this is what it took on Wall Street or off Wall Street as I started back then just to, like, get some traction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=500" target="_blank">00:08:20.280</a></span> | <span class="t">If you could sell, then you were useful in some way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

the other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=511" target="_blank">00:08:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And I definitely was not going to be an analyst.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=513" target="_blank">00:08:33.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, you were either an analyst or a portfolio manager.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=517" target="_blank">00:08:37.800</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=526" target="_blank">00:08:46.060</a></span> | <span class="t">You talk a lot in your book about the movie, The Wolf of Wall Street, because it was really real for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=531" target="_blank">00:08:51.700</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, you actually mentioned in that book several times that some of the things that you wrote about while that movie was being written were things that you were writing about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=541" target="_blank">00:09:01.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, so I came into the business on the tail end of the Wolf of Wall Street era.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=546" target="_blank">00:09:06.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And by the way, nobody actually called Jordan Belfort that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=549" target="_blank">00:09:09.940</a></span> | <span class="t">He kind of invented that name for himself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=551" target="_blank">00:09:11.700</a></span> | <span

class="t">But I came in after the Stratton-Oakmont era.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=556" target="_blank">00:09:16.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And when Stratton-Oakmont went down, there was a diaspora of people who had learned the Belfort method of selling stocks over the phone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=566" target="_blank">00:09:26.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And those people didn't go into retirement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=568" target="_blank">00:09:28.840</a></span> | <span class="t">They all launched their own version.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=571" target="_blank">00:09:31.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And the conceit was, we're going to do what Stratton did, but we're going to do it legit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=577" target="_blank">00:09:37.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, we're going to do it better, which, of course, was not true.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=580" target="_blank">00:09:40.780</a></span> | <span class="t">But that was their pitch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=582" target="_blank">00:09:42.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So these are the hundreds of firms that I'm talking about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=585" target="_blank">00:09:45.180</a></span> | <span class="t">They were on Staten Island.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=586" target="_blank">00:09:46.860</a></span> | <span class="t">They were in lower Manhattan in the financial district.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=589" target="_blank">00:09:49.860</a></span> | <span class="t">They were on Long Island, New Jersey, Boca Raton.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=593" target="_blank">00:09:53.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It was like a bomb went off and all these bodies scattered.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=597" target="_blank">00:09:57.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And then they picked themselves back up and they got back on the phone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=600" target="_blank">00:10:00.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So I worked at a couple of firms that had been run by people who came from Stratton.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=607" target="_blank">00:10:07.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of the things that I thought it was very – I mean, in hindsight, at the time, you don't know what's going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=612" target="_blank">00:10:12.840</a></span> | <span class="t">But in hindsight, one of the things that was really creative that they figured out was that you don't start off pitching the stock that your firm is making a market in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=623" target="_blank">00:10:23.900</a></span> | <span class="t">You start off pitching Bristol-Myers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=625" target="_blank">00:10:25.740</a></span> | <span class="t">You start off pitching IBM because nobody says no to Bristol-Myers or IBM.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=632" target="_blank">00:10:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Then the client sends a check.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=634" target="_blank">00:10:34.680</a></span> | <span class="t">The account is open.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=635" target="_blank">00:10:35.640</a></span> | <span class="t">It's funded.</span></div><div

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=637" target="_blank">00:10:37.380</a></span> | <span class="t">The second time you call the client, that's when you have an electronic contract manufacturer from Asia, $3.5 stock in your firm's market-making account.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=647" target="_blank">00:10:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You could sell it for $4 or $4.50 and capture $0.50 to $1 in between.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=653" target="_blank">00:10:53.080</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not until you're there for a while that you realize, oh, that's why these guys have Porsches and Ferraris.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=659" target="_blank">00:10:59.880</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what's going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=661" target="_blank">00:11:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I guess I was a slow learner.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=662" target="_blank">00:11:02.520</a></span> | <span class="t">It took me a minute to figure it out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=663" target="_blank">00:11:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But that ended up being the game.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=666" target="_blank">00:11:06.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=666" target="_blank">00:11:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">They used to call that the rip.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=668" target="_blank">00:11:08.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So they had the rip and they would bait people with respectable investments in companies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=673" target="_blank">00:11:13.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And what was interesting is that in all of these firms, there would always be that one broker who refused to go along.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=682" target="_blank">00:11:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it would have been you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=687" target="_blank">00:11:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So I would meet these guys and I would say, hey, you seem to not – hey, you're not cheering and clapping during the morning meetings and you're always reading.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=698"

finished my contract and was able to leave without having to pay them any money back is when I published my first book, Serious Money, which I self-published.</span></div><div class="c"><span

target="_blank">00:17:33.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is according to Jason Zweig, who apparently sent you a note that it was you who caused this.</span></div><div class="c"><span

situation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1064" target="_blank">00:17:44.660</a></span> | <span class="t">You know what?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1065" target="_blank">00:17:45.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I appreciate that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1066" target="_blank">00:17:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I think Jason was proud of me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1068" target="_blank">00:17:48.620</a></span> | <span class="t">It was not personal, and I didn't say let me shut down this fund.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1072" target="_blank">00:17:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I was using this particular fund as an example of a category, something that investors were being sold in the aftermath of a crisis was anything but S&P funds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1083" target="_blank">00:18:03.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And the more elaborate and ornate and the more derivatives and different bells and

<span class="t">And they were charging a ton of money, and they were selling a story of all weather, and this is going to be a fund that's going to make it so you don't have to have drawdowns, but also you're going to get all the upside of the market.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1107" target="_blank">00:18:27.500</a></span> |

target="_blank">00:18:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Their job is to market a product.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1112" target="_blank">00:18:32.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And of course, fund companies want to launch expensive, high-cost products because that's where the margins are.</span></div><div

time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1122" target="_blank">00:18:42.740</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not – this was not being

exactly what people want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1127" target="_blank">00:18:47.300</a></span> | <span class="t">After the market crashes, they want to be told a story where they could have avoided it and still had the upside.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1133" target="_blank">00:18:53.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Like that's what people are looking for, holy grail, in every industry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1137" target="_blank">00:18:57.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Ours is no

to the worst of human nature, and they sold a product that, quite frankly, could not have worked based on the way it was constructed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1148" target="_blank">00:19:08.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I watched it for two years, and I said, that's it.</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1151" target="_blank">00:19:11.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And I wrote the piece, and very quietly, I think a couple of months later, they closed the fund down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1158" target="_blank">00:19:18.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And I remember – I'll never forget Jason sending me a note and saying, you did this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1163" target="_blank">00:19:23.460</a></span> | <span class="t">I was – Rick, I was not like – I wasn't high-fiving anyone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1167" target="_blank">00:19:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I was horrified.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1169" target="_blank">00:19:29.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Because it was the first time that I really got the sense that things that you could write on a blog with no gatekeeper, no one in charge, nobody editing you, could have a real-world impact like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1182" target="_blank">00:19:42.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So it forced me to, I think, be a little bit more – I don't want to say careful, but maybe a little bit more meticulous in what I was doing and saying because people were watching.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1193"

really interesting blogs, which did lead you to this gig, if you will, at CNBC.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1286" target="_blank">00:21:26.740</a></span> | <span class="t">How did that all come about?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1288"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1297" target="_blank">00:21:37.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And I would read everything that was happening in the markets.</span></div><div

book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1304" target="_blank">00:21:44.300</a></span> | <span class="t">I would read the Wall Street

class="t">And then I would spend a lot of time on Twitter where in those days, there weren't a lot of people talking about finance, but there were some very successful people writing under pen names pseudonymously.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1320" target="_blank">00:22:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And I would absorb everything they were saying.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1323" target="_blank">00:22:03.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I would have an inbox filled with research because once I became prominent, everybody wanted me to read, you know, whatever research their firms were putting out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1331" target="_blank">00:22:11.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So I thought I was in a position where I really was getting a lot of insight from a lot of places.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1337" target="_blank">00:22:17.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And my skill was never as a primary researcher.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1340" target="_blank">00:22:20.820</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:22:25.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So I would try to reconcile a lot of things happening from the economy to the markets to Wall Street, you know, insider business stuff and like just try to figure out the combinations of things that are leading to what's driving the trends.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1363" target="_blank">00:22:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And I would try to synthesize all of that into something that was entertaining for the reader.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1368" target="_blank">00:22:48.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I was still an outsider at that time, but I think I had a really good handle on why the markets were moving, who was saying what, how the products were being created to meet the demand, how the wholesalers were connecting with advisors who were then selling things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1383" target="_blank">00:23:03.540</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:23:07.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And before long, the people at CNBC, somebody contacted me and said, you know, we're reading your stuff every morning in our editorial

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1406" target="_blank">00:23:26.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So they gave me a shot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1409" target="_blank">00:23:29.860</a></span> | <span class="t">I did a blog post.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

on fast money at five o'clock and do a remote hit, which I know you've done these before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1420"

target="_blank">00:26:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And he connected this one really big idea, which is that, and I know this is audio, not visual.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1611" target="_blank">00:26:51.880</a></span> | <span class="t">You can't have housing prices do this, go lower left to upper right, and have incomes go straight across flat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1619" target="_blank">00:26:59.960</a></span> | <span class="t">That

it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1639" target="_blank">00:27:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So he's got a phone ringing off

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1816" target="_blank">00:30:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And let's give them the ability to say what they want to say.</span></div><div

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1831" target="_blank">00:30:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And when we had that thing humming for the first time, it wasn't until we launched our own firm in 2013.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1837" target="_blank">00:30:37.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think we

target="_blank">00:30:42.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's when we had really started to hit our stride.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1846" target="_blank">00:30:46.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I remember being in your office the day that you announced or were about to

for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1854" target="_blank">00:30:54.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Absolutely.</span></div><div

bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1859" target="_blank">00:30:59.380</a></span> | <span class="t">But now you're into different things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1860" target="_blank">00:31:00.840</a></span> | <span class="t">You actually have a media production company.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1862" target="_blank">00:31:02.660</a></span> | <span class="t">You're doing a – you just finished a huge conference for advisors out on the West Coast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1867" target="_blank">00:31:07.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So just talk about those two things briefly for a second.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1869" target="_blank">00:31:09.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So we launched the Compound Media because the shows had gotten so big that you're talking about millions and millions of views on YouTube.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1877" target="_blank">00:31:17.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And you're talking about millions of downloads for the podcast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1881" target="_blank">00:31:21.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And it just gets to the point where it's like if we want to maintain the quality, we're going to need help.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1888" target="_blank">00:31:28.060</a></span> | <span class="t">We're going to have to bring people on who are going to be full-time helping us produce this content professionally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1893" target="_blank">00:31:33.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean IP.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1894" target="_blank">00:31:34.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, the IP.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1895" target="_blank">00:31:35.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Make sure it gets out on time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1897" target="_blank">00:31:37.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Make sure there are – all the compliance labeling has to be on it, et cetera, et cetera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1902" target="_blank">00:31:42.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So it led to really like a full-blown media business.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1907" target="_blank">00:31:47.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And that media business has enabled us to do what we do at a very high level and audience engagement with the fans, live events.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1915" target="_blank">00:31:55.620</a></span> | <span class="t">We went to California in late April.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1918" target="_blank">00:31:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We did a live event there, brought out a few hundred people who lived in the LA area who were diehard fans.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1924" target="_blank">00:32:04.600</a></span> | <span class="t">All of that takes money and all of that takes a lot of help and full-time employees.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1930" target="_blank">00:32:10.280</a></span> | <span class="t">You can't really ham and egg that kind of thing and do it with contractors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1934" target="_blank">00:32:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So that was the idea behind doing a media company as opposed to just trying to do a pod.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1941" target="_blank">00:32:21.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think it's obvious at this point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1945" target="_blank">00:32:25.300</a></span> | <span class="t">It was not obvious 10 years ago that that was the route we were going to go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1948" target="_blank">00:32:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's really exciting because this is another thing I never had any experience doing and I'm learning on the job.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1955" target="_blank">00:32:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm going to put you on the spot here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1958" target="_blank">00:32:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So you wrote this in the book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1960" target="_blank">00:32:40.820</a></span> | <span class="t">By the way, you were very open in the book and very honest in the book about where you're sitting right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B6P3ua7pLA&t=1967" target="_blank">00:32:47.180</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:32:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And I had heard this before, but I want to repeat it because it's really pertinent to the investment industry.</span></div><div
