It's the first Fast.ai course in a long time. And the reason it's been so long is because we've wanted to create something that is truly AI native, that is, you know, really makes sense in this new world that we're in.</p><p>And to be honest, it's taken us a long time to figure out what the hell to do, but we think we've got something you're going to really like. So the exciting feature of the AI filled world that Jeremy mentioned is that more and more people than ever are starting to code.</p><p>They're using language models to generate their first ever projects, their first ever websites. And this is really great. We love to see what people are doing. But there is also something that we've noticed, which is that when you're able to generate these giant pieces of code that you don't necessarily understand, there can be a wall that you hit.</p><p>You get really excited. You add more and more features and then suddenly you reach a point where, oh gosh, I can't edit this or I don't understand where to go next. And even though today's AIs are amazing and they are probably only going to get better, there's still some things that they can't fix either.</p><p>So that's the problem that we've been seeing. And what it turns into is a lot of people thinking, gee, this coding thing must not even be for me, right? Even though I've got all these amazing tools, I clearly must be missing something because I still can't get it to do exactly what I want.</p><p>Yeah. But it's not your fault, right? Exactly. Yeah. So that's what our course is hoping to address. We think we've got a different way of building up to coding with language models that doesn't leave you in that helpless position with a bunch of code you don't understand. And so that's what we'd like to try and teach you.</p><p>In fact, it's more than we think we know. We do know. We have actually been using this new process and new tool we're going to be teaching you about ourselves for the last few months. I've been using it for all my work and I am dramatically more effective and productive than I was.</p><p>So this is not just for fairly new programmers. I think experienced programmers who are looking to understand how to combine their expertise with AI better will also appreciate this. Start joining the course if you've never coded before. You should know about variables. You should know about loops. You should know about if statements and be able to do some basic stuff in Python.</p><p>But you don't need too much more than that. We're going to show you a new way to solve problems with code that doesn't require a computer science degree, that leverages AI, but as you use our approach, you're going to be learning more and more about coding. And this approach is one where you'll be using AI, not just to build stuff, but to actually become a better coder as you do.</p><p>It'll be all based on the classic fast AI teaching style where you'll be building stuff from day one, very, very hands on. And in the process, you'll be learning a lot of really powerful techniques and foundations. So the way this course is going to work, it's going to take a little bit of unlearning.</p><p>I think if some of us have habits of generating a ton of code all at once, it's very much building up these muscles of gradually, iteratively, line by line, step by step, putting together things that you want. So we're going to be doing it as a live course together.</p><p>I think twice a week for eight weeks, we'll have lessons, but they'll also be office hours. And it's a live cohort, which means there'll be hundreds of other learners also building these muscles together and practicing and figuring out this way of approaching problems. And we'll be doing this in a custom tool that we've built to work well with this approach.</p><p>So I think it's going to be an exciting group to be a part of as we try and figure out these approaches together. And I should also mention, we're treating this as a beta course. So you should join if you're prepared to be involved in something that's being a bit built around you as it happens, it'll be the first time this has ever happened.</p><p>I will say all the folks who were involved in the very first ever fast AI course, most of them I still know to this day. Most of them have gone on to have extremely successful careers as startup founders and in research labs and so forth. I think this will be a bit like that, you know, although the old days of fast AI is something very new, very fresh, not quite complete.</p><p>So it might require a little bit of patience and a little bit of enthusiasm to be part of the journey that we're all taking together. So if this sounds like something that's for you, then can't wait to see you there. And we'll all learn how to solve it with code.</p><p>Thanks, Joanna. Thank you.</p></div></div></body></html>
