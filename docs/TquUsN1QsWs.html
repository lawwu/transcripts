href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=80" target="_blank">00:01:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And also an opportunity to stop them before they happen.</span></div><div

process of the patient's journey within the healthcare system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's traditionally thought of as a series of steps that goes from one to the next.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=100" target="_blank">00:01:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And just a little bit about how I got here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=104" target="_blank">00:01:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I started my career in tech working at Google, building software for operational teams,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and then working on speech recognition and language modeling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=114" target="_blank">00:01:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Back in my day, which is now like over 10 years ago, we were comparing language models that took traditional models with Google-scale data,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and compared them to deep learning models, trying to make them compete with each other and see which one worked better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But one of the really interesting projects that we worked on was what is now called Ambient.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is one of the things where people are trying to use this technology to improve the administrative burden for doctors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's because oftentimes doctors will spend hours after they see a patient writing, documenting, and creating notes for themselves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">While we weren't successful back then, today there's multiple projects and multiple groups launching this and making it commercially viable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it's been really successful and really exciting to see that change.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Then I spent a little time in the world of startups, in the world of biotech.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I changed both the scale and the domain that I worked in, and it was very exciting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I was really excited to work on a very strong mission, a really exciting mission where we had a big opportunity to make a big impact.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I started first in diagnostics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is where I built models and built teams to detect cancer from blood.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The goal was to give early insight into whether or not a patient had cancer or not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we used machine learning to look at the blood and look for biomarkers and look across multiple data sets and patients to identify where might be the signal for cancer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">After spending some time there and seeing the company grow from 30 people to over 300 people, I ended up at an even smaller therapeutic startup.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We worked on novel data sets looking for unique interactions in complex microbiome communities to try to identify compounds that could be unique and really valuable in drug discovery.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's the thing, when most people think about AI and healthcare, these are the things that most people think of, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's diagnostics, there's imaging, there's other ways to improve documentation and decision making for clinicians and drug discovery.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And these are really impactful and really important problems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I really enjoyed working on them, but there are some of the toughest and hardest to solve.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But that's also because some of the benefits are going to be massive as we continue to see groups and organization crack parts of it and make headway.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We're seeing a lot of change already.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But there is another part of the system, the healthcare system, that's not nearly as flashy, doesn't nearly have the same attention on research or in media, that also has a huge, measurable, real impact and is also ripe for AI disruption.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's the healthcare, the financial side of healthcare.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right now, we estimate that 20% of the GDP is attributed to the healthcare system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">A large proportion of that is the administration of healthcare.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=305" target="_blank">00:05:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is billing, insurance related things, but it starts from like the very beginning through to the very end of the patient's journey with any healthcare provider.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Starting with eligibility checks, registration, there's documentation, medical coding, denial management, so on and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Oftentimes, these aren't things that you'll see when you visit a doctor's office.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Not unless you encounter like a really challenging situation or you lack coverage or you face some complication with your care.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But this process is very complex because it is very manual, it is very rules driven, and very inconsistent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And over the past three decades, this healthcare administration in general, the number of people working in healthcare administration has increased 30 fold.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=356" target="_blank">00:05:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But in the same time period, the number of clinicians has barely doubled.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it just goes to show how much faster, how much more complex, how much more quickly this area grows compared to the clinical side of healthcare.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=371" target="_blank">00:06:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And just another note about terminology, I'll keep using these words, patients, providers, and payers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=377" target="_blank">00:06:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Patients, I think we all can understand, those are the people who receive care.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And providers are the ones who deliver it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=383" target="_blank">00:06:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">People like the hospitals, the specialty offices, the specialists, nurses, and doctors that actually conduct and provide care, medical care to the patients.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=392" target="_blank">00:06:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the payers are those who provide the funding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=395" target="_blank">00:06:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So largely insurance companies, which would be private payers, but also other government institutions like Medicare and Medicaid.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=405" target="_blank">00:06:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And just to help make that more concrete, the cost and complexity of healthcare is really correlated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=416" target="_blank">00:06:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We estimate a large amount of the cost associated with healthcare is actually related to friction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=421" target="_blank">00:07:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And in this case, friction means the inefficiencies around communicating back and forth between payers and providers and patients.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=428" target="_blank">00:07:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And often a lot of that actually results in the same outcome, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=435" target="_blank">00:07:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Either the claim gets paid or it doesn't get paid.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=438" target="_blank">00:07:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the things we'll talk about is denials because that's one of the biggest components of friction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=443" target="_blank">00:07:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's because it's both time and money for the provider to manage, appeal, and work through that process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=450" target="_blank">00:07:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then with, again, very slim margins for these hospital systems, any impact or any change in the denial rate can have a huge impact.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=462" target="_blank">00:07:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And ultimately, AI has a big opportunity to shift resources from this bureaucracy, this friction, towards hopefully something else, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=471" target="_blank">00:07:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Something more productive, we might agree, would be like the clinical care or anything else that we've described.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=479" target="_blank">00:07:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So just to make it concrete for you guys, this is an example of what a claim might look like and also how much conversation occurs between the patients,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=490" target="_blank">00:08:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">well, largely the providers and the payers, you know, before, during, and after a patient visit or a patient encounter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=497"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=505" target="_blank">00:08:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The provider had to send documentation multiple times through multiple interfaces and probably through multiple different manual processes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=516" target="_blank">00:08:36.000</a></span> |

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=524" target="_blank">00:08:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And with AI happening, you know, across the field, you know, providers aren't the only one looking to AI to make and improve their process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=535" target="_blank">00:08:55.000</a></span>

target="_blank">00:08:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They've also increased their denial rates.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=540" target="_blank">00:09:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They're leveraging AI as well for increasing the volume that they're able to adjudicate and to identify issues for denials,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=550" target="_blank">00:09:10.000</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=558" target="_blank">00:09:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the thing is that most of these denials aren't necessarily -- don't necessarily require a better appeal system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=565" target="_blank">00:09:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not like they need a smarter appeal system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=567" target="_blank">00:09:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They just need a way to avoid errors that cause these in the first place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=571" target="_blank">00:09:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That is, most of the time, they're not necessarily medical agreements.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=575" target="_blank">00:09:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They're just technical errors in registration or missing data that if we were to put them together in the right way the first time around,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=581" target="_blank">00:09:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">we could avoid a lot of this friction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=586" target="_blank">00:09:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, how at Ensemble are we hoping to be able to solve this problem?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=589" target="_blank">00:09:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We think because we are an end-to-end RCM organization, full service provider, we have an opportunity to see the longitudinal data,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=599" target="_blank">00:09:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">connect the dots between -- from the very beginning of the process to the very end of the process,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=603" target="_blank">00:10:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and really make a change before the error occurs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=608" target="_blank">00:10:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the first situations I'll talk about is prior auth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=613" target="_blank">00:10:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is an issue that affects the entire industry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=618" target="_blank">00:10:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And prior auths occur because the payers have required providers to ask for permission for certain procedures.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=627" target="_blank">00:10:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's really challenging because it's often not clear when a prior auth is required.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=632" target="_blank">00:10:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You sometimes have to go to the payer portal and say, you know, does this procedure require prior authorization?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=639" target="_blank">00:10:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And even when you do, sometimes they still might deny it because it was incorrect or just the policy had changed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=648" target="_blank">00:10:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think this is where we really think we have an opportunity to change, to basically correct the error before it happens,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=655" target="_blank">00:10:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">because we can see that data from -- you know, see all the historical data from the beginning part where prior auths are requested and acquired</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=665" target="_blank">00:11:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to the end of the process where we see the final denials.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=670" target="_blank">00:11:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Where AI can help, not only can we try to predict denial, we can also try to identify and correct the denial.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=677" target="_blank">00:11:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So an example is like if we see certain procedures and we know that often another denial reason is that the procedure was missing from the original document.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=688" target="_blank">00:11:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we can try to flag that early and say, if you're looking at these procedures, you actually might actually want this other one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=693" target="_blank">00:11:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And finally, even the actual process of acquiring prior authorization is a big opportunity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=698" target="_blank">00:11:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a -- it's a manual process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=700" target="_blank">00:11:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It requires documentation from different parts of the system to be put together by someone and sent off to the payers to make that request for power authorization.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=717" target="_blank">00:11:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But sometimes we are not as successful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=720" target="_blank">00:12:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes it still may be the case that our denials may still occur.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=727" target="_blank">00:12:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We can't always avoid denials, but we're really -- but we're very excited because Gen.AI really has an opportunity to help us accelerate and improve that process as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=738" target="_blank">00:12:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The case study I'll talk about right now is called clinical denials.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=742" target="_blank">00:12:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this occurs when the payer and the provider disagree about what was medically necessary to care for the patient.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=753" target="_blank">00:12:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And when this happens, the provider has -- in order for them to appeal, they have to go through a process where they have to build the entire appeal packet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=765" target="_blank">00:12:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They'll need to look through the patient record.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=767" target="_blank">00:12:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They'll look through guidelines or standard guidelines of care to identify what care should have been provided to the patient.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=776" target="_blank">00:12:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They look through payer policies to see what -- which would or would not be covered.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=780" target="_blank">00:13:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is all a very time-consuming process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=782" target="_blank">00:13:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Some of these EMRs or electronic medical records are hundreds of pages long.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=787" target="_blank">00:13:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They have -- they have all types of data in them, text, images, labs, notes, tables.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=795" target="_blank">00:13:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The clinical guidelines themselves have, you know, hundreds of clinical guidelines.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=799" target="_blank">00:13:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And for different situations, you'll need different -- different -- different guidelines.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=805" target="_blank">00:13:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And all this is done under tight deadlines to make sure that you respond in time to the payer after the denial.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=811" target="_blank">00:13:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And all this means that there's a -- there's a very real and limiting factor of, you know, how many expert clinicians can we get into the process to help us build and generate these -- appeals, excuse me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=826" target="_blank">00:13:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">As you might expect, you know, Gen.AI can actually generate an appeal letter for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=833" target="_blank">00:13:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">An off-the-shelf one can, if you prompt it, will give you some appeal letter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=837" target="_blank">00:13:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But unfortunately, that alone wasn't sufficient.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=840" target="_blank">00:14:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We found that when we worked directly with our clinical experts, that off-the-shelf models alone wasn't sufficient.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=847" target="_blank">00:14:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, we really worked hand-in-hand to develop a -- a model and a pipeline that allows the -- not only the -- the letter to be -- to meet the standard, the quality standard that we have as an organization, but also to allow the clinical expert to make the final decision on whether or not the letter meets the -- meets the standard of quality before it gets submitted to the -- to the payer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=874" target="_blank">00:14:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is important because there -- there's also complexity around the clinical appeal process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=879" target="_blank">00:14:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's different service lines, different -- different clients.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=882" target="_blank">00:14:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And all that -- all that gets put together in our Gen.AI system to make sure that we can deliver these appeals more quickly and more consistently.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=891" target="_blank">00:14:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We've seen already that we're increasing the speed of the process, a 40% reduction in time, sometimes even more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=899" target="_blank">00:14:59.000</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:15:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">How often are we seeing appeals being -- denials being overturned.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=909" target="_blank">00:15:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we've also seen the -- as a result, the volume grow.</span></div><div

-- as part of this operational and service team, we're able to really measure the -- the ROI directly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=922" target="_blank">00:15:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not just like a hand wavy, this is value.</span></div><div class="c"><span

really exciting things about bringing -- bringing -- bringing -- bringing AI to this RCM process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TquUsN1QsWs&t=937" target="_blank">00:15:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I know AI won't -- I won't -- I won't purport to say that AI will be able to solve all of the problems overnight.</span></div><div
