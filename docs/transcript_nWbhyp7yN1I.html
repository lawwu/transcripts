I think that's what he said. Their feelings were hurt. They're violating Epic's free speech because they don't like what Epic is saying. According to Epic, yes. This is crazily heavy handed by Apple.</p><p>Apple heavy handed with developers. Have they lost their minds? I mean, this is right out of Power Corrupts and Absolute Power Corrupts. Absolutely. Yeah. Whatever dispute you have with Epic, you don't boot them out of your app store because you don't like their criticism of you. This is basically proving exactly what everyone's been saying about Apple, which is they're too powerful and heavy handed.</p><p>And Apple's coming along and saying, let me confirm it for you guys by acting tyrannically against Epic. Talk about a backfire. This seems insane to me.</p></div></div></body></html>
