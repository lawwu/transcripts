To this day we are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVuNPL5QO8Q&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">generating about 90 million lines of code every single day. And that equates to around a thousand,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVuNPL5QO8Q&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">over a thousand messages sent every single minute.

I'm not going to sit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVuNPL5QO8Q&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">here and tell you about the numbers. I'm going to tell you about the why. Why do people feel connected to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVuNPL5QO8Q&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the Windsurf editor? And I know no AI company really wants to disclose its secrets, but I had to come up with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVuNPL5QO8Q&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">some content. So today I'm going to let you in on one of ours. Our secret sauce is a shared timeline</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVuNPL5QO8Q&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">between the human and the AI. And this is what makes people feel like we're reading their minds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVuNPL5QO8Q&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And now everything you do as a software engineer can be thought of on this shared timeline. So if we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVuNPL5QO8Q&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">rewind way back to the dark days - this is pre-autocomplete when everyone knew how to write a for loop - AI had to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVuNPL5QO8Q&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">everything. You had to edit files. You had to type every single character. Imagine that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVuNPL5QO8Q&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">But then once services like Copilot, like Codium, they launched, then devs got really excited. They</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVuNPL5QO8Q&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">started seeing a small percentage of their code being written by AI, and we started to abstract and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVuNPL5QO8Q&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">accelerate the number of small edits, small actions that we would do for a user. And in late 2024,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVuNPL5QO8Q&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">with the advent of Windsurf's agent and the launch of the Windsurf editor, we saw that we could do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVuNPL5QO8Q&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">more and more for the user. We started being able to edit multiple files at once, perform background</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVuNPL5QO8Q&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">research across thousands and thousands of files, and execute terminal commands directly inside the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVuNPL5QO8Q&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">editor. But at Windsurf, we're in the business of trying to change how software gets created. And this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVuNPL5QO8Q&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">means that the timeline is actually a little bit more complicated. It needs to handle actions taken outside</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVuNPL5QO8Q&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">of just the IDE. And so given how much of a developer's workflow happens outside of the editor,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVuNPL5QO8Q&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">what does this mean for Windsurf? First, Windsurf is going to be everywhere.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVuNPL5QO8Q&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Specifically, Windsurf will need to be able to read and ingest context from every single source that a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVuNPL5QO8Q&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.240</a></span> | <span class="t">developer uses. And if we zoom out and think about what makes you all, software engineers, successful,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVuNPL5QO8Q&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">there are a couple of different categories. The first of which, coding related. File reads, running</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVuNPL5QO8Q&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">terminal commands, seeing your history, even which tabs you have open inside of your editor. This all informs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVuNPL5QO8Q&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">how to generate the correct code. But it goes beyond that. There's external sources. Things like going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVuNPL5QO8Q&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">onto GitHub and viewing a past history of commits. Maybe looking at a PR that is doing something similar to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVuNPL5QO8Q&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the feature you're about to implement. Doing online searches, web searches, looking at documentation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVuNPL5QO8Q&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there's the third category, and this is where it gets a little bit interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVuNPL5QO8Q&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It's called meta-learning. It's the idea of what separates a junior engineer from a senior engineer from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVuNPL5QO8Q&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">from a staff engineer. These are the organizational best practices, the engineering preferences that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVuNPL5QO8Q&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">all get encoded into what makes good code. And so if we think about what this means in practice,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVuNPL5QO8Q&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">let's say that we are going to build a new page on a data viz dashboard. Let's walk through step by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVuNPL5QO8Q&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">step. So first, you would probably start in Slack, as all good things start from Slack. You'll build context,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVuNPL5QO8Q&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">looking at a bunch of maybe customer requests. Maybe you'll have some internal messages. You'll collect that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVuNPL5QO8Q&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">context, and you'll start planning. And this means you're going to be in Google Docs. You're going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVuNPL5QO8Q&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">be writing design docs, probably working on some infrastructure designs. You're going to be tracking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVuNPL5QO8Q&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">tickets inside of Jira. And then you might have a designer who's actually working in Figma in parallel,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVuNPL5QO8Q&t=333" target="_blank">00:05:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">putting together all this material. And then finally the fun part, or at least this is my favorite part,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVuNPL5QO8Q&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">which is the actual writing of the code, and hopefully use something like Windsurf to do so.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVuNPL5QO8Q&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">But you're not done from there. Once your code complete, you still have to open the PR. You've got to get reviews,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVuNPL5QO8Q&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you've got to merge into main, you've got to deploy SEO, analytics, the list goes on and on and on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVuNPL5QO8Q&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is really why we've built what we've built.

But we know that's also not enough. We know it's not enough just to read.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVuNPL5QO8Q&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.480</a></span> | <span class="t">We need to be able to do and write everything.
