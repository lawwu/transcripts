And what would be great is if I could help transform the thinking and the culture in that country to have a better handle on human rights and more value on human rights and individual liberties and a lot of other stuff.</p><p>And gosh, it kind of looks like people were doing that. And it kind of looks like it worked out. It's like someone's thinking through, "Hey, I'm thinking about this sort of esoteric question about what a government owes to its citizens or when a citizen has a right to overthrow a government or when it's acceptable to enforce certain beliefs and not." And it's like the other person in the dialogue is just like, "This is the weirdest, most esoteric question.</p><p>Why does this matter? Why aren't you helping poor people?" But these are the questions that the Enlightenment thinkers were thinking about. And I think there is a good case that they came up with a lot of stuff that really shaped the whole world since then.</p></div></div></body></html>
