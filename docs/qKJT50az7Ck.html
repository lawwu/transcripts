it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKJT50az7Ck&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And what I remember is you had this

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKJT50az7Ck&t=348" target="_blank">00:05:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And I remember that a lot of things just seemed easy, for lack of a better word, in terms of, oh, it's not that hard to, like, set up a website or a blog on WordPress.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKJT50az7Ck&t=361"

target="_blank">00:06:16.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to call it the art of nonconformity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKJT50az7Ck&t=378" target="_blank">00:06:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So she helped me kind of get going with an initial design for that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKJT50az7Ck&t=382" target="_blank">00:06:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there were people like you, like Gretchen Rubin, Leo Babauta, J.D.

target="_blank">00:06:31.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And I looked up to them, to you guys, and I was like, oh, it's interesting what, you know, everybody else has done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKJT50az7Ck&t=398" target="_blank">00:06:38.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I wonder if it's too late, you know, for me to do something in this space.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKJT50az7Ck&t=402" target="_blank">00:06:42.740</a></span> | <span class="t">But I'll try, you know, and the going to every country in the world thing, like I had been doing it for a while as a personal quest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKJT50az7Ck&t=408" target="_blank">00:06:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">It wasn't like this is my, you know, marketing campaign.</span></div><div

know, to like, okay, this is a, you know, I want to write about life, work and travel, which is super broad.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKJT50az7Ck&t=418" target="_blank">00:06:58.380</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, it's like the opposite of the conventional wisdom about, like, choose this, you know, very specific niche.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKJT50az7Ck&t=424" target="_blank">00:07:04.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And so since I want to write about life, work and travel under the lens of nonconformity, it's helpful to have, like, oh, and I'm going to every country in the world as part of this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKJT50az7Ck&t=432" target="_blank">00:07:12.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's kind of how it came to be.</span></div><div

saying, hey, I got this thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKJT50az7Ck&t=438" target="_blank">00:07:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And a lot of people were kind enough to, like, link to it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKJT50az7Ck&t=441" target="_blank">00:07:21.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And that was like a currency back then, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKJT50az7Ck&t=443" target="_blank">00:07:23.020</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, it still is to some degree, but I think back then it was like, oh, if people are, like, linking up your blog, then that's very valuable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKJT50az7Ck&t=450" target="_blank">00:07:30.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And you were kind, you know, to write a post about me and the manifesto.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKJT50az7Ck&t=455" target="_blank">00:07:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, things kind of transpired from there for both of us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKJT50az7Ck&t=459" target="_blank">00:07:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And we ended up hosting an event that you came and spoke at.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKJT50az7Ck&t=462" target="_blank">00:07:42.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And you were obviously, like, taking off and going in different directions as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKJT50az7Ck&t=466" target="_blank">00:07:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">But that's kind of how it started for me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKJT50az7Ck&t=467" target="_blank">00:07:47.560</a></span> | <span class="t">That event, the events you used to run, we've talked about them on the show before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKJT50az7Ck&t=472" target="_blank">00:07:52.020</a></span> | <span class="t">I guess it came a little bit later, like the 2010s, the World Domination Summits that you ran.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKJT50az7Ck&t=477" target="_blank">00:07:57.820</a></span> | <span class="t">I've talked about it on the show nostalgically before with people because I don't

memory, that first one I went to, A, like, the crowd there was really interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKJT50az7Ck&t=487" target="_blank">00:08:07.780</a></span> | <span class="t">It was, I remember Brene Brown was there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

was happening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKJT50az7Ck&t=505" target="_blank">00:08:25.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I remember I was hanging

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKJT50az7Ck&t=515" target="_blank">00:08:35.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was an interesting energy that's not really there anymore, I guess.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKJT50az7Ck&t=520" target="_blank">00:08:40.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, that idea of, like, we would all get together in the same place with, like, 800 people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKJT50az7Ck&t=524"

target="_blank">00:08:46.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, when you had the $100 startup, then you're like, we're going to give everyone $100.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKJT50az7Ck&t=530" target="_blank">00:08:50.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Except for there was 1,000 people there.</span></div><div class="c"><span

think as, like, old millennials and young Gen Xers, there was really something in that post-9-11 world of, like, this online world was unlocking a lot of Tim Ferrissian, let's design our lives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKJT50az7Ck&t=566" target="_blank">00:09:26.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, what do we want to

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKJT50az7Ck&t=1132" target="_blank">00:18:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">But I would say right now, like the podcast is like the primary financial model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKJT50az7Ck&t=1136" target="_blank">00:18:56.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And the podcast is something I

target="_blank">00:19:01.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So, that's, you know, remarkable in some ways, but also I think it's good to evolve, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKJT50az7Ck&t=1145" target="_blank">00:19:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">in other ways and do different things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKJT50az7Ck&t=1160" target="_blank">00:19:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And the Substack newsletter has a paid component, but I really don't push it very

something, but I think the difference</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKJT50az7Ck&t=1869" target="_blank">00:31:09.620</a></span> | <span
