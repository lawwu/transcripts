href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEvMI6R6Er0&t=573">00:09:33.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I learned something really interesting that I just wanted to share with you guys.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEvMI6R6Er0&t=577">00:09:37.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So there was a big CPI print, obviously.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEvMI6R6Er0&t=580">00:09:40.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But there was a report, probably not many people read it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEvMI6R6Er0&t=584">00:09:44.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But it was about home equity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEvMI6R6Er0&t=587">00:09:47.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And the takeaway was that since 2020, Americans have taken 430, I think the exact number is 427.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEvMI6R6Er0&t=597">00:09:57.660</a></span> | <span class="t">$427 billion of home equity out of their homes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEvMI6R6Er0&t=601">00:10:01.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And effectively spent it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEvMI6R6Er0&t=603">00:10:03.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So what it started to make me think about was if you look at all of that home equity,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEvMI6R6Er0&t=609">00:10:09.660</a></span> | <span class="t">plus the stimmy checks, plus the unemployment insurance checks, that starts to explain,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEvMI6R6Er0&t=615">00:10:15.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I think, why the labor markets are so tight and why people haven't gone back to work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEvMI6R6Er0&t=618">00:10:18.660</a></span> | <span class="t">There is no motivation because there's just so much money sloshing around for them to basically not have to be forced to do any of this stuff that they don't want to anymore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEvMI6R6Er0&t=627">00:10:27.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think the thing to keep in mind is like, that's also why we're in this situation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEvMI6R6Er0&t=629">00:10:29.660</a></span> | <span class="t">We're in this situation.</span></div><div

market.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEvMI6R6Er0&t=633">00:10:33.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It's also what's driven up the price of used cars, new cars, all of this stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEvMI6R6Er0&t=638">00:10:38.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I just think that kind of like starts to paint a picture of CPI that's really important, which is that it's probably a little bit more transitory than we may actually think.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEvMI6R6Er0&t=650">00:10:50.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Because when you exhaust all of that extra money that's in the system, there's not as much inflation to be had.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEvMI6R6Er0&t=659">00:10:59.660</a></span> | <span class="t">People are now forecasting that inflation is really going to taper off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEvMI6R6Er0&t=662">00:11:02.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And the big warning sign that everybody is sort of marching towards is too many excessive rate hikes between now and the end of the year could actually push us into a real recession.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEvMI6R6Er0&t=673">00:11:13.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And we were talking about that before, but the probability is now sort of like one in three.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEvMI6R6Er0&t=678">00:11:18.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Whereas before, I think David and

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEvMI6R6Er0&t=687">00:11:27.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Worth considering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

because you maybe still have some COVID fears, you don't want to commute or you're just out of the rhythm for two years, and you're like, I'm kind of enjoying skiing or whatever you're doing, whatever your jam is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEvMI6R6Er0&t=715">00:11:55.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe there's no rush to get there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEvMI6R6Er0&t=717">00:11:57.660</a></span> | <span class="t">There's no rush to get back.</span></div><div

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEvMI6R6Er0&t=722">00:12:02.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we're not, as we talked about, we're not letting people into the country at the same time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEvMI6R6Er0&t=728">00:12:08.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So you still have 10

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEvMI6R6Er0&t=741">00:12:21.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, I think that we're probably going to have a quarter or two contraction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEvMI6R6Er0&t=746">00:12:26.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It's probably going to happen at sort of at the late end of this year, beginning of next year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEvMI6R6Er0&t=751">00:12:31.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Just the real question is how high are rates between now and then?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEvMI6R6Er0&t=756">00:12:36.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, I think the setup isn't very good, which is that the investors in the stock market are playing chicken with the Fed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEvMI6R6Er0&t=764">00:12:44.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And they're just at the beginning of a rate cycle, and they haven't been able to impact any real forms of liquidity in the equity market.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEvMI6R6Er0&t=771">00:12:51.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I think they're going to attack.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEvMI6R6Er0&t=775">00:12:55.660</a></span> | <span class="t">That and the only blunt force

could see rates at three, three and a half percent, and that's going to impact a lot of stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEvMI6R6Er0&t=783">00:13:03.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And the problem is that, you know, it's going to be after the economy has slowed down because it's going to be after a lot of these, you know, fake savings, if you will, have been depleted.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEvMI6R6Er0&t=792">00:13:12.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, well, we're seeing some pressure come off as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span

go down in the second half of this year is because inflation is measured on a year-over-year basis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEvMI6R6Er0&t=858">00:14:18.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And you remember about a year ago is when inflation started.</span></div><div class="c"><span

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEvMI6R6Er0&t=864">00:14:24.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Then it reached 5% by the summer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEvMI6R6Er0&t=866">00:14:26.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Then by the end of the year, it was almost 8%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
