So I am excited to talk about what's in my wallet this year. We're in 2025, recording this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=49" target="_blank">00:00:49.520</a></span> | <span class="t">on June 4th. The irony here is I don't actually carry a wallet, right? Well, technically I do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=54" target="_blank">00:00:54.700</a></span> | <span class="t">I carry this MOFT wallet that attaches to an iPhone. It really only holds two cards and a driver's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=59" target="_blank">00:00:59.800</a></span> | <span class="t">license. I do have this giant book that has tons and tons of cards in it, like back to back to back</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=67" target="_blank">00:01:07.700</a></span> | <span class="t">to back. So this is where I keep all of my credit cards. I will put a link in the show notes if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=72" target="_blank">00:01:12.520</a></span> | <span class="t">have a bunch of cards and need something. It was the best one I've tried of a few things. So what is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=78" target="_blank">00:01:18.460</a></span> | <span class="t">actually in my wallet is usually the Amex gold card and the bank of America travel rewards card,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.860</a></span> | <span class="t">just a everything card and a, you know, four X on dining and groceries. Mostly because dining seems</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.020</a></span> | <span class="t">to be the one category where I need a physical card and then a everything catch all card. If I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=96" target="_blank">00:01:36.900</a></span> | <span class="t">traveling and I grab a bunch of things, um, but most of the time I can use Apple pay. So just because I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=101" target="_blank">00:01:41.940</a></span> | <span class="t">only have two cards on me doesn't mean I don't have every single card I have that I can in my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Apple pay account. So as I go through this episode, I want to flag that I'm going to mention a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=111" target="_blank">00:01:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">cards. And what I'm going to actually do instead of overwhelm the show notes too much is I'm going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.140</a></span> | <span class="t">to put a link to a blog post version of this episode in the show notes, which will also have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.700</a></span> | <span class="t">all the details of every card category, et cetera. And you can also find all the details, uh, on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">website, all the hacks.com. If you want to go find anything links to cards, links to posts, we've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.460</a></span> | <span class="t">written episodes, et cetera. So what I'll do today is I'm going to start by running through all of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.100</a></span> | <span class="t">cards. I have what we have, whether we should get rid of any, then I'll run through the major categories</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and talk about my favorites and ruminate a bit on what cards are missing that I might be opening up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.840</a></span> | <span class="t">before the end of the year. And as I go through all of this, when I think of a credit card,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.460</a></span> | <span class="t">I think there's really three reasons that I might want to have a credit card. And one of them is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=155" target="_blank">00:02:35.940</a></span> | <span class="t">probably the obvious one most people think of. And that's because it earns a lot of points or cash</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.840</a></span> | <span class="t">back on categories I spend in. If you spend a lot of money on dining, having a card that rewards you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.560</a></span> | <span class="t">for that dining. If you spend a lot of money on groceries, same thing. Or if you just spend a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.560</a></span> | <span class="t">of money that doesn't fall into a specific category, having a card that rewards your everyday</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.420</a></span> | <span class="t">spending, whatever category that is, there are a lot of categories where there aren't cards for bonuses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So that could be another one. So that's one reason I have a card. Next reason I have a card is that it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.640</a></span> | <span class="t">has perks that you really value. So for example, there are cards that give you access to lounges.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.820</a></span> | <span class="t">There are cards that help you accrue elite status with airlines or hotel groups. There are cards that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.060</a></span> | <span class="t">have free night certificates. There are some cards that just have so many benefits and perks that relative</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to the annual fee, you actually think that the card is a profitable card every single year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.700</a></span> | <span class="t">I know there are a handful of hotel cards that are maybe $95 a year, but give you a free night</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.040</a></span> | <span class="t">certificate, maybe some bonus points on anniversary every year. And so you're like, well, having this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">card is actually profitable to keep. I do think that one of the things that holds a lot of people back</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.660</a></span> | <span class="t">is that annual fee. And one of the challenges for people new to the credit card and points a mile</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.400</a></span> | <span class="t">space is this idea of a really high annual fee and how to approach it. Because I know a lot of people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that hear about the Amex Platinum or the Chase Sapphire Reserve and think, wow, that annual fee</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.140</a></span> | <span class="t">is more than $500. How could I ever even consider that card? That's crazy. And I will just flag that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.540</a></span> | <span class="t">for almost every card with a really high annual fee, there are perks, benefits, discounts, credits that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">when you add them all up pays way more than the annual fee. I think last time I looked, I probably have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.740</a></span> | <span class="t">$3,000 or $4,000 a year of annual fees across all my cards. But for any card that's in the second year</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.580</a></span> | <span class="t">of that card, and I'll get to that in the next point, I can simply go in and say, how much are these cards</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">worth to me? And if I'm getting an Indeed credit that I never use, it doesn't matter if that's a $400</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">credit. To me, its value is zero. But if I'm getting a $10 a month Uber credit, and I spend more than $10</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.140</a></span> | <span class="t">on Uber every month, no matter what, then that really could be valued at $10. Now you could make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.660</a></span> | <span class="t">an argument that maybe because normally I'd get three or four X points that you could value it at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.220</a></span> | <span class="t">95%. So instead of $10, it's worth 950, but it's pretty close to face value. So that's something I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">think about. So if I look at a card that has a $550 annual fee, but you get a $300 rebate on any</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">purchases and travel, I view that $300 rebate as direct cash. So if it was a $550 annual fee,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'd view it as $250 just from that one credit. And as you go through different credits, you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=316" target="_blank">00:05:16.760</a></span> | <span class="t">figure that out. I'd encourage you to take a look at the premium card worksheet that the frequent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">miler produces. I'll put a link in the show notes. They go through for a lot of the major high fee</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.960</a></span> | <span class="t">cards, all the different perks, and you can go in and put your value of those perks and decide whether</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that card is worth it for you. So get a card because the bonuses you get match your spending,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">get a card because the perks are things you really value and maybe couldn't get otherwise. Or the third</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.020</a></span> | <span class="t">one is get a card because the welcome bonus or the welcome offer you get from opening up a card</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=345" target="_blank">00:05:45.140</a></span> | <span class="t">really makes that card worth it for you, at least in that year. Now, I love welcome bonuses. I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that anything over about 75,000 points is probably something interesting. There are so many offers worth</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.420</a></span> | <span class="t">that much or more. So I tend to be a little picky and I get really excited when I see the 100,000,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.340</a></span> | <span class="t">120,000 point offer or five free hotel night certificates offer. Anything like that's exciting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=371" target="_blank">00:06:11.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes there's business cards with two, 300,000 point welcome offers, and those are really exciting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=377" target="_blank">00:06:17.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's something I think about all the time when I'm looking at why would I have a card?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=382" target="_blank">00:06:22.420</a></span> | <span class="t">It's either going to improve my value proposition every year, it's going to give me perks I didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=387" target="_blank">00:06:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">have access to, or the welcome bonus is going to be really, really rewarding.

And sometimes those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=395" target="_blank">00:06:35.960</a></span> | <span class="t">cards have high annual fees. So every time I'm looking at a card after the first year, I go through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.240</a></span> | <span class="t">this kind of review process of, well, am I still valuing the perks enough to keep it? Am I still getting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.220</a></span> | <span class="t">enough value from the spending to keep it? And if it really was, that welcome bonus was amazing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.540</a></span> | <span class="t">but there's no real ongoing value for the card, I'll go through a mental checklist because usually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=415" target="_blank">00:06:55.720</a></span> | <span class="t">that card will have an annual fee. And so I'll say, okay, if it's not valuable to me, can I downgrade</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=421" target="_blank">00:07:01.060</a></span> | <span class="t">it to another card? And a lot of issuers will let you product change your card from one with a high</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=425" target="_blank">00:07:05.700</a></span> | <span class="t">annual fee to one with a really low annual fee, or no annual fee, or a card that's more valuable to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=431" target="_blank">00:07:11.620</a></span> | <span class="t">you. I know within the city ecosystem, the custom cash card is one that people often would downgrade</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=437" target="_blank">00:07:17.860</a></span> | <span class="t">other cards they didn't want to, because it gave 5x points on up to $500 a month in categories that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=444" target="_blank">00:07:24.280</a></span> | <span class="t">you chose. So that could be a really interesting card. So that's one option. Let's say that's not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=450" target="_blank">00:07:30.260</a></span> | <span class="t">an option. Let's say there is no downgrade path for the card you have, then you could ask, is there any</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=454" target="_blank">00:07:34.740</a></span> | <span class="t">retention offer? You know, if you reach out to the issuer and say, hey, I have this card, I don't think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=459" target="_blank">00:07:39.780</a></span> | <span class="t">the ongoing value is going to be worth keeping it given the annual fee. Is there anything you guys could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=464" target="_blank">00:07:44.220</a></span> | <span class="t">do? Sometimes they'll say, oh, well, why don't we waive it this year? Or why don't we give you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=468" target="_blank">00:07:48.220</a></span> | <span class="t">30,000 points if you can spend $1,000 on the card, like a little mini welcome bonus. So that's an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=473" target="_blank">00:07:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">option. And then if neither of those things are possible, if downgrading the card doesn't make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=477" target="_blank">00:07:57.620</a></span> | <span class="t">sense, if you know, getting a retention offer doesn't make sense, then it's not a terrible idea</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=483" target="_blank">00:08:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to cancel the card. But what I would say before you cancel the card is if the credit limit on that card</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=489" target="_blank">00:08:09.620</a></span> | <span class="t">is valuable to you, you could shift it to other cards from that issuer. There's a process sometimes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=494" target="_blank">00:08:14.420</a></span> | <span class="t">online, sometimes on the phone where you can say, hey, I've got these two cards, each has a $10,000</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=499" target="_blank">00:08:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">limit. Could we make one of them 18,000 and then leave the other at 2000? And they say, great, we did</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=504" target="_blank">00:08:24.920</a></span> | <span class="t">that. Great. Now can I close the one with the $2,000 limit? So that is something you can do before you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.260</a></span> | <span class="t">cancel the card. I would just wait till after one full year to cancel the card, because there are some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=514" target="_blank">00:08:34.680</a></span> | <span class="t">issuers that look down upon opening up a card, getting the welcome bonus and canceling it before</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=519" target="_blank">00:08:39.560</a></span> | <span class="t">the end of the year. Now, once that annual fee does post, you can still cancel the card, usually within</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=524" target="_blank">00:08:44.520</a></span> | <span class="t">30 days of the statement closing with the annual fee on it and get that annual fee refunded. So that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=530" target="_blank">00:08:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">how I think about canceling it. Let me talk a little bit about my goals for cards this year. So I am always</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=536" target="_blank">00:08:56.820</a></span> | <span class="t">looking to maximize the earnings I get from all my everyday spending, all the category spending I have,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=543" target="_blank">00:09:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">but I'm not just going to get a card because it earns more points on something I could spend on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=548" target="_blank">00:09:08.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's say I spend $500 a year on entertainment. And right now I would be putting it on a 2X points</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=555" target="_blank">00:09:15.480</a></span> | <span class="t">card. And now there's a card that offers 3X points on entertainment. I'm just going to get an extra 500</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=561" target="_blank">00:09:21.020</a></span> | <span class="t">points a year from that deal because I could have otherwise gotten the 2X. So getting 500 points,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=565" target="_blank">00:09:25.800</a></span> | <span class="t">which might be valued no more than $5 to $10 is not worth me opening up a new card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=572" target="_blank">00:09:32.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So I really want to see that the value I'm going to get from a new card is probably going to exceed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=577" target="_blank">00:09:37.240</a></span> | <span class="t">at least $200 a year is probably the floor before I'm interested in opening it. And that floor is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=583" target="_blank">00:09:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">likely higher because the average welcome bonus is probably worth somewhere around $750 to $1,000 or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=592" target="_blank">00:09:52.060</a></span> | <span class="t">more. So if a card's only going to give me $200 of value, I would be better off opening up a new card,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=598" target="_blank">00:09:58.820</a></span> | <span class="t">which by the way would give me $1,000 of value. So it's almost worth five years of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=603" target="_blank">00:10:03.380</a></span> | <span class="t">that card. And that's kind of how I think about it. The earnings on a new card have to outweigh the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=607" target="_blank">00:10:07.600</a></span> | <span class="t">opportunity cost of getting a new card with a welcome bonus. Now it could be a mix. That card</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=611" target="_blank">00:10:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">could have a smaller welcome bonus plus a value every year, maybe plus a few extra perks, and then it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=617" target="_blank">00:10:17.380</a></span> | <span class="t">worth it. So that's one. Another goal for the year is I really love transferable points. This is not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=624" target="_blank">00:10:24.540</a></span> | <span class="t">going to be an episode where we go deep on transferable points. We've done episodes in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=628" target="_blank">00:10:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">past on redeeming your points for maximum value. In a couple weeks, I'm going to talk about some of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=633" target="_blank">00:10:33.580</a></span> | <span class="t">tricks you can use to book award travel. And then we're going to do an episode breaking down all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=638" target="_blank">00:10:38.120</a></span> | <span class="t">best transfer partners. But at the end of the day, I find the transferring points from your credit card</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=643" target="_blank">00:10:43.780</a></span> | <span class="t">to airlines and hotel groups is definitely the way I get the most value out of points. And so one of my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=651" target="_blank">00:10:51.380</a></span> | <span class="t">goals this year, when I look at all my cards is I want to keep a pool of points in all of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=656" target="_blank">00:10:56.100</a></span> | <span class="t">transferable currencies I have, which includes Capital One, Amex, Built, Chase, and now Citi,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=662" target="_blank">00:11:02.140</a></span> | <span class="t">which is new for me this year. So that's a goal. Next goal is I want some more welcome bonuses this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=666" target="_blank">00:11:06.740</a></span> | <span class="t">year. I'm at $324, my wife's at $224, which is kind of a measurement in the industry for those not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=674" target="_blank">00:11:14.020</a></span> | <span class="t">familiar. Chase tends to not approve anyone for new cards if they've had five cards opened in the last</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=680" target="_blank">00:11:20.340</a></span> | <span class="t">24 months, at least five cards that show up on your credit report. So a business card might not count.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=685" target="_blank">00:11:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we're below that threshold, which means we could open new Chase cards, we could open new cards</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=689" target="_blank">00:11:29.460</a></span> | <span class="t">from almost any issuer. And so that's something I'm thinking about. I also want to keep maintaining</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=694" target="_blank">00:11:34.040</a></span> | <span class="t">lounge access. We travel with kids all the time now. And kids are always hungry, we get to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=700" target="_blank">00:11:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">airport earlier. So it's nice to have a quieter place to go to get some food and just have a place</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=705" target="_blank">00:11:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">to relax. And a couple of these lounges actually have little kids play areas, which is makes them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=710" target="_blank">00:11:50.040</a></span> | <span class="t">even better. So definitely want to maintain that. Another goal this year that's a little new from last</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=715" target="_blank">00:11:55.720</a></span> | <span class="t">year is that when cashback is more efficient than points, I'm willing to do that. It would have been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=721" target="_blank">00:12:01.260</a></span> | <span class="t">crazy when I recorded the 2024 version of this episode almost 18 months ago to think about getting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=726" target="_blank">00:12:06.780</a></span> | <span class="t">cashback. For some reason, I was just so wired to focus on points.

So for example, if I'm spending money on just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=744" target="_blank">00:12:24.020</a></span> | <span class="t">something that gets no bonus on any card, obviously, I could be using my Venture X card,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=748" target="_blank">00:12:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">get 2x points on everything. But I also have a Bank of America card with Platinum Honors, which is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=754" target="_blank">00:12:34.900</a></span> | <span class="t">their program that elevates all of their rewards based on how many dollars you have on deposit at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=760" target="_blank">00:12:40.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Bank of America, which brings up their unlimited cash and their travel rewards and their premium</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=765" target="_blank">00:12:45.740</a></span> | <span class="t">rewards cards all the way up to 2.625% cashback. And if you want to go deeper on that, I'll link to an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=771" target="_blank">00:12:51.380</a></span> | <span class="t">episode in the show notes on the best cashback cards. But comparing 2.625% to 2x points means</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=780" target="_blank">00:13:00.180</a></span> | <span class="t">that I'm effectively buying points at around 1.3 cents each. Now, on top of that, within the Bank of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=787" target="_blank">00:13:07.160</a></span> | <span class="t">America program, if you have the premium rewards elite card, those points or the cashback you earn</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=792" target="_blank">00:13:12.340</a></span> | <span class="t">can actually be used to book flights for 25% more value. So if you're using them in that way,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=798" target="_blank">00:13:18.760</a></span> | <span class="t">it's effectively about a 3.28% cashback card, which means that using the Venture X card over the Bank</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=805" target="_blank">00:13:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">of America card is effectively buying points at a little more than 1.6 cents each. Now, I have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=811" target="_blank">00:13:31.580</a></span> | <span class="t">definitely been able to use Capital One, Amex, Chase points to get way more than 1.6 cents of value</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=818" target="_blank">00:13:38.520</a></span> | <span class="t">plenty and plenty of times.

I think 1.6 cents is even a fair price to pay because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=841" target="_blank">00:14:01.500</a></span> | <span class="t">sometimes we get 2, 3, 4, 5 cents a point.

But because I already</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=889" target="_blank">00:14:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">have enough points, I'm not sure it does. And so that's something that I think about when I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=894" target="_blank">00:14:54.140</a></span> | <span class="t">trying to decide which new cards to get. It's not just which one gives me the most points,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=899" target="_blank">00:14:59.020</a></span> | <span class="t">it's which one gives me the most return. And when I think of return, I'm thinking of the value of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=903" target="_blank">00:15:03.540</a></span> | <span class="t">points somewhere around one and a half cents in my mind. Certain points I'd say are slightly more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=909" target="_blank">00:15:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">valuable. With Chase, I found that I've been able to get so much value out of Hyatt recently that I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=914" target="_blank">00:15:14.120</a></span> | <span class="t">put those points a little more valuable than other ones. With Citibank, I find that we only have about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=919" target="_blank">00:15:19.460</a></span> | <span class="t">100,000 points right now. So I'm actually more willing to get Citi points than I would other programs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=925" target="_blank">00:15:25.500</a></span> | <span class="t">because there are a couple of interesting uses with Leading Hotels and Preferred Hotels and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=931" target="_blank">00:15:31.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Eva Air that I just couldn't do unless I have more points.

Okay, so those are my goals this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=941" target="_blank">00:15:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">year. Let's review the cards I have. And before I review them, one of the things that I would encourage</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=946" target="_blank">00:15:46.940</a></span> | <span class="t">everyone to do if you go through this process yourself is first, go find some way to categorize</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=953" target="_blank">00:15:53.420</a></span> | <span class="t">where you spend money. Now, if you only have a couple credit cards, most issuers have like an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=958" target="_blank">00:15:58.780</a></span> | <span class="t">annual summary. So you could go pull up the end of year 2024 summary, and it usually breaks down your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=964" target="_blank">00:16:04.180</a></span> | <span class="t">spending by category. For us, we have so many cards across so many issuers that compiling all that data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=969" target="_blank">00:16:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">together would take a lot of work. And I know for some of them, it's a PDF. Obviously, I could probably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=973" target="_blank">00:16:13.740</a></span> | <span class="t">just throw all those into ChatGPT and ask a question, which now that I'm thinking about that process</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=978" target="_blank">00:16:18.440</a></span> | <span class="t">might have been easier. But we also use a app called Copilot to do all of our budgeting. I'm a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=984" target="_blank">00:16:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">huge fan of it. And that makes it really easy for us to go and say, where do we spend all our money</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=988" target="_blank">00:16:28.500</a></span> | <span class="t">because we categorize all our transactions. So I can go in and say, how much did we spend on dining?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=993" target="_blank">00:16:33.100</a></span> | <span class="t">How much did we spend on these various categories? So whatever tool you use to track your spending,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=998" target="_blank">00:16:38.200</a></span> | <span class="t">or the end of year summaries from your bank, I think both of those are valid options. But realistically,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1003" target="_blank">00:16:43.420</a></span> | <span class="t">even if it's just an estimate, even if you just think, okay, how much do we generally spend in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1008" target="_blank">00:16:48.520</a></span> | <span class="t">major categories you can earn bonuses on dining, groceries, travel, maybe specifically broken out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1014" target="_blank">00:16:54.940</a></span> | <span class="t">to hotels and flights, entertainment, cell phone bills, or other bills like that. For me, those are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1021" target="_blank">00:17:01.460</a></span> | <span class="t">things that I'm thinking about. And even if you just ballpark it, it might be fine. Then I'm going to go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1026" target="_blank">00:17:06.280</a></span> | <span class="t">through all the cards and see how much value I get from that card. And so there's a tool I built to help me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1032" target="_blank">00:17:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">with this. It's a spreadsheet that kind of goes through and looks at all the different earnings</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1036" target="_blank">00:17:16.460</a></span> | <span class="t">possibilities for every single card, lets you put in how you spend your money, and then check different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1041" target="_blank">00:17:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">cards to see if adding that card to the mix will increase your average return, both in a relative</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1048" target="_blank">00:17:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">sense, meaning you go from 2.6 to 2.5% back on everything or 2.5 to 2.8 X points. So it does that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1056" target="_blank">00:17:36.380</a></span> | <span class="t">but it also will tell you your total dollar return based on how you value points and a lot of other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1060" target="_blank">00:17:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">stuff. So if you want to check that out, it's at allthehacks.com slash card tool. I actually took a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1065" target="_blank">00:17:45.880</a></span> | <span class="t">bunch of time to go update it with new cards that have come out recently, some of the changes in old</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1071" target="_blank">00:17:51.620</a></span> | <span class="t">cards. So hopefully that's really valuable to you. If there's a card missing, you're welcome to add it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1076" target="_blank">00:17:56.300</a></span> | <span class="t">yourself. The instructions show you how to do that as well. So here's how I think about a value of a card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1081" target="_blank">00:18:01.720</a></span> | <span class="t">It's really just like I described earlier, the amount of spending allocated to it compared to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1087" target="_blank">00:18:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">opportunity cost. So if you spend $500 a month on dining and you have a 3X dining card from Chase</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1092" target="_blank">00:18:12.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and you want to think about going to the Amex gold card, you're going to get one extra point per dollar,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1097" target="_blank">00:18:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">which is on $500 a month or $6,000 a year, 6,000 more points. Let's say you value points at one and a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1105" target="_blank">00:18:25.380</a></span> | <span class="t">half cents. If you don't, you shouldn't be getting any of these points cards. That's only an extra $90.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1110" target="_blank">00:18:30.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And the card has a $325 annual fee. Even if you subtract whatever those perks and credits are for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1116" target="_blank">00:18:36.300</a></span> | <span class="t">you, I imagine that breakeven is not going to be very compelling. But if you spent $3,000 a month on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1122" target="_blank">00:18:42.460</a></span> | <span class="t">dining or $5,000 a month on dining, now we're talking about 30 to 60,000 points a year, which could be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1129" target="_blank">00:18:49.780</a></span> | <span class="t">hundreds and hundreds of dollars. And I think now that becomes really interesting. We also didn't talk</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1135" target="_blank">00:18:55.180</a></span> | <span class="t">about the fact that it gets 4X groceries and all that kind of stuff. So that's the framework I use. I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1140" target="_blank">00:19:00.520</a></span> | <span class="t">wouldn't just think of it as well, what are 4X points worth a year on this category if you already have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1145" target="_blank">00:19:05.780</a></span> | <span class="t">card earning three of them.

So you got a Chase Sapphire Reserve. I definitely want to keep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1294" target="_blank">00:21:34.700</a></span> | <span class="t">that because it makes my Chase points more valuable because it unlocks so many transfer partners. It</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1298" target="_blank">00:21:38.940</a></span> | <span class="t">unlocks one and a half points in the portal and you get 3x on travel and dining and we have a huge limit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1303" target="_blank">00:21:43.100</a></span> | <span class="t">on it. So that's a great card. The lounge access we use. I've had it for a really long time and I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1308" target="_blank">00:21:48.700</a></span> | <span class="t">always curious what perks might be added to it. And it's kind of the marquee card of that brand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1313" target="_blank">00:21:53.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Chase Amazon Prime card. We used to use it for 5% off, but recently we've been buying a lot of gift</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1318" target="_blank">00:21:58.860</a></span> | <span class="t">cards at around 5% off, if not more. So the primary use case for it is anytime we're buying something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1324" target="_blank">00:22:04.700</a></span> | <span class="t">where we want purchase protection and still want 5% off because if you use your gift cards,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1329" target="_blank">00:22:09.100</a></span> | <span class="t">you wouldn't get that.

Hyatt business card. Love this card. We've been traveling and staying at Hyatt's a ton.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1343" target="_blank">00:22:23.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Have really valued being a globalist and this card is probably the only way I would have closed the gap</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1347" target="_blank">00:22:27.660</a></span> | <span class="t">to get there. They've got a bunch of cool perks that come with the card like points rebates and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1352" target="_blank">00:22:32.860</a></span> | <span class="t">credits for staying at Hyatt. Definitely a keeper. Next is the Southwest business card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1357" target="_blank">00:22:37.820</a></span> | <span class="t">This year we actually got a lot closer to Companion Pass than I thought, thanks to some Chase referrals</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1362" target="_blank">00:22:42.860</a></span> | <span class="t">posting. And so having this card was an excellent way for us to close the gap to get to Companion Pass.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1368" target="_blank">00:22:48.620</a></span> | <span class="t">If anyone's not familiar, I'll link to a post about Companion Pass, but it's a level of status that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1373" target="_blank">00:22:53.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Southwest gives you a person you can nominate to fly free and you just pay taxes and fees for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1378" target="_blank">00:22:58.700</a></span> | <span class="t">year you earn it and the following year.

Next is the Chase Freedom Flex. You get 5x on these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1390" target="_blank">00:23:10.220</a></span> | <span class="t">rotating categories every quarter. And I'd say two or three quarters a year, a category pops up that we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1396" target="_blank">00:23:16.300</a></span> | <span class="t">actually spend enough on that we can hit that 5x. So love keeping this card. On the flip side, we have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1401" target="_blank">00:23:21.180</a></span> | <span class="t">a Freedom Unlimited card which earns 1.5x on everything and we almost never use it if ever. Maybe we use it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1407" target="_blank">00:23:27.500</a></span> | <span class="t">at drugstores where I think it gets 3x points or 3% back. So that card probably should be product</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1413" target="_blank">00:23:33.500</a></span> | <span class="t">change to another Freedom Flex so we can get 5x on another $1,500 in those quarters that matter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1418" target="_blank">00:23:38.540</a></span> | <span class="t">My wife has a United card.

All right, Amex. Gold card, 4x on dining and grocery. We spend a ton</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1463" target="_blank">00:24:23.500</a></span> | <span class="t">in those categories. Absolutely keeping the card. We can make pretty good use out of the credits such that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1468" target="_blank">00:24:28.780</a></span> | <span class="t">it's definitely a positive ROI. We do have two platinum cards. I think we probably opened the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1472" target="_blank">00:24:32.700</a></span> | <span class="t">second one for a large welcome bonus, but kept it because they removed guest access for the Centurion</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1478" target="_blank">00:24:38.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Lounge and we wanted to have the ability to be able to go as a family or at least Amy and I go and get in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1483" target="_blank">00:24:43.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Now that our children are old enough, they either need their own card, which they're not old enough</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1487" target="_blank">00:24:47.820</a></span> | <span class="t">for, or you have to spend $75,000 on an Amex platinum card in order to get guest access.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1494" target="_blank">00:24:54.380</a></span> | <span class="t">We actually did that this year on one of the business cards.

And we probably don't need all of these though. We've gotten a few mailers in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1611" target="_blank">00:26:51.180</a></span> | <span class="t">mail offering some really great welcome bonuses, which led me and Amy to sign up for each of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1616" target="_blank">00:26:56.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So not sure what we'll do with the business Platinums. They do have some changes to the perks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1621" target="_blank">00:27:01.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And I expect that as the Dell perks have gotten devalued, maybe in the second half of the year,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1625" target="_blank">00:27:05.820</a></span> | <span class="t">we'll see something new, which will help us decide whether they actually make sense to hang on to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1630" target="_blank">00:27:10.780</a></span> | <span class="t">On the business gold side, the Forex points in a bunch of different categories,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1635" target="_blank">00:27:15.740</a></span> | <span class="t">you get it in the top two categories you spend in.

So as long as we're able to get enough value to cover the annual fee, we'll probably keep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1645" target="_blank">00:27:25.980</a></span> | <span class="t">them.

One is the Bonvoy business card, got it a long time ago because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1653" target="_blank">00:27:33.020</a></span> | <span class="t">I was pretty excited about Marriott.

And we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1668" target="_blank">00:27:48.700</a></span> | <span class="t">actually relying on the Bonvoy brilliant card to just get that status as one of the benefits.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1673" target="_blank">00:27:53.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think you could view this card as we pay an annual fee to get a free night certificate,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1678" target="_blank">00:27:58.060</a></span> | <span class="t">but I think it's capped at 35,000 points and we haven't had a ton of great use for those one-off</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1683" target="_blank">00:28:03.820</a></span> | <span class="t">low value certificates. If we are able to use it, then we probably get more than the annual fee of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1688" target="_blank">00:28:08.140</a></span> | <span class="t">value. So it's probably a wash, but it's not a card that, you know, I'm not excited to be using that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1693" target="_blank">00:28:13.180</a></span> | <span class="t">often. And then last, I have an Amex blue card that I've held for 20 plus years. I think it's my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1697" target="_blank">00:28:17.740</a></span> | <span class="t">oldest card that I still have open. So I'll probably keep putting a couple of charges on that card</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1702" target="_blank">00:28:22.060</a></span> | <span class="t">every year just to make sure it stays open. Capital one, we opened two Venture X cards when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1707" target="_blank">00:28:27.820</a></span> | <span class="t">they had a hundred thousand point welcome offer when they launched it have been using them a ton</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1711" target="_blank">00:28:31.820</a></span> | <span class="t">for two X points. I talked earlier about why we've moved some of that to cash back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1717" target="_blank">00:28:37.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Definitely. We'll keep one of these around, but probably don't need two of them, especially</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1720" target="_blank">00:28:40.940</a></span> | <span class="t">because capital one makes it really easy to move their miles from one card member to the other,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1725" target="_blank">00:28:45.180</a></span> | <span class="t">even if you don't live in the same household.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1726" target="_blank">00:28:46.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Also have a spark cash plus card that I opened on the business side, had a really big welcome offer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1732" target="_blank">00:28:52.540</a></span> | <span class="t">and we actually put a ton of spend on it even beyond the welcome offer just to get 2% back on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1737" target="_blank">00:28:57.580</a></span> | <span class="t">everything. But as things have changed, I feel like there's more lucrative ways to earn points,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1742" target="_blank">00:29:02.700</a></span> | <span class="t">miles and cash back than just 2%. So this is one where I haven't really been using it much at all,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1748" target="_blank">00:29:08.140</a></span> | <span class="t">and probably just time for us to part ways. New addition this year is Bank of America,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1752" target="_blank">00:29:12.380</a></span> | <span class="t">we've actually have four new cards, and three of them are all tied to their cashback platinum honor</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1758" target="_blank">00:29:18.060</a></span> | <span class="t">status. And so for those not familiar, if you're able to deposit $100,000 in a Bank of America account,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1765" target="_blank">00:29:25.020</a></span> | <span class="t">or a Merrill Lynch account, it can be a self-directed brokerage account.

They multiply the earnings of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1774" target="_blank">00:29:34.380</a></span> | <span class="t">the card by 1.75. They have tiers below that as well, that if you can only put $25,000 or $50,000,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1780" target="_blank">00:29:40.940</a></span> | <span class="t">you'll still get rewarded, but not as much if you can meet the $100,000 requirement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1785" target="_blank">00:29:45.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the premium rewards elite card is the consumer version that we have.

Now it's marketed as a 1.5x on everything, 2x on travel and dining. But when you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1811" target="_blank">00:30:11.660</a></span> | <span class="t">multiply each of those by 1.75 for the platinum honor status, and then you multiply them by 1.25,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1817" target="_blank">00:30:17.660</a></span> | <span class="t">because we can use the points we earn to book flights for a boosted value, that's where I get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1822" target="_blank">00:30:22.860</a></span> | <span class="t">to those numbers. So that's a nice cashback everyday driver for a lot of the spend we do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1827" target="_blank">00:30:27.660</a></span> | <span class="t">On the business side, we've got the travel rewards card, which is the same thing on the everything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1833" target="_blank">00:30:33.740</a></span> | <span class="t">spend, but doesn't have any boost for travel and dining.

And then we opened an Alaska business card this year,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=1867" target="_blank">00:31:07.500</a></span> | <span class="t">primarily because we've been flying Alaska a lot more, and I was gonna go for Alaska status.

So she's getting a loyalty point and me as the primary</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2009" target="_blank">00:33:29.340</a></span> | <span class="t">cardholder are. So it's helping not only earn points that you can redeem, but earn status for both of us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2015" target="_blank">00:33:35.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there is a value to that. In fact, I think for us, earning status on American is even more valuable</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2022" target="_blank">00:33:42.300</a></span> | <span class="t">for flying on Alaska than earning status on Alaska, because we can actually earn a higher tier of status</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2029" target="_blank">00:33:49.740</a></span> | <span class="t">here than we could using just the Alaska card.

And that's really the last credit card that I have in my wallet. I know it's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2040" target="_blank">00:34:00.140</a></span> | <span class="t">lot, but despite that we do not rent, the interesting thing about the built card is that they have been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2047" target="_blank">00:34:07.020</a></span> | <span class="t">constantly doing promotions on their rent day, which is the first of the month that allow you with built</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2052" target="_blank">00:34:12.620</a></span> | <span class="t">status to transfer to their transfer partners, which by the way, I think they have the best lineup of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2057" target="_blank">00:34:17.420</a></span> | <span class="t">transfer partners.

And if you rent up to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2089" target="_blank">00:34:49.900</a></span> | <span class="t">100,000 points paying your rent with no fee, amazing. But earning 3x on dining, if your points</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2097" target="_blank">00:34:57.500</a></span> | <span class="t">are always transferring at one to two is kind of like earning 6x on dining, and it's kind of like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2101" target="_blank">00:35:01.980</a></span> | <span class="t">earning 4x on travel. And at that rate, it's a card that I'm pretty compelled to spend on at least to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2107" target="_blank">00:35:07.820</a></span> | <span class="t">get to the point that I maintain that platinum status. So those points continue to be worth that much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2113" target="_blank">00:35:13.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Only other card we have is a target red card. Technically, it's a debit card. So it probably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2116" target="_blank">00:35:16.940</a></span> | <span class="t">shouldn't be in here. It does earn 5% back, which is pretty good for a debit card, at least on target</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2121" target="_blank">00:35:21.740</a></span> | <span class="t">purchases.

But it's a debit card, it doesn't impact your credit, it has no annual fee. So there's no real</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2137" target="_blank">00:35:37.020</a></span> | <span class="t">downside to keeping it. So now that I ran through all the cards I have, I talked a little about what I want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2141" target="_blank">00:35:41.260</a></span> | <span class="t">do with them. Let's talk about the major categories. Now, this episode is not meant to be the definitive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2146" target="_blank">00:35:46.460</a></span> | <span class="t">guide to the best card in every single category. It doesn't include a lot of cards that have 5 to 6x</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2152" target="_blank">00:35:52.540</a></span> | <span class="t">points in those categories if it's capped at $500 a month or $1,500 a quarter, because in a lot of cases,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2159" target="_blank">00:35:59.980</a></span> | <span class="t">the ROI of opening up a card for an extra 6000 points a year just doesn't make sense. Obviously,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2166" target="_blank">00:36:06.300</a></span> | <span class="t">if you downgrade to that card, and you've already had it open and has no annual fee, why not? But those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2170" target="_blank">00:36:10.620</a></span> | <span class="t">are cards that I'm usually not going to consider opening up for new, especially because they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2175" target="_blank">00:36:15.100</a></span> | <span class="t">usually have lower welcome bonuses. So that's why they're not here. So what I'm going to do is run</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2179" target="_blank">00:36:19.260</a></span> | <span class="t">through the categories, talk about how I landed on the card I have and what some good alternatives are,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2184" target="_blank">00:36:24.380</a></span> | <span class="t">just to kind of showcase my process here. So I'll start with dining, it's probably one of our biggest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2188" target="_blank">00:36:28.620</a></span> | <span class="t">categories that we spend money on. And we use primarily the Amex gold at 4x points. But we have probably more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2196" target="_blank">00:36:36.220</a></span> | <span class="t">than any other category, a lot of backups, the Chase Reserve, the Freedom Flex, the Freedom Unlimited,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2202" target="_blank">00:36:42.860</a></span> | <span class="t">the Built Card, all those cards are earning 3x points. If we didn't have those, you could also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2208" target="_blank">00:36:48.380</a></span> | <span class="t">earn the same 3x points with the Chase Preferred, with the Wells Fargo Autograph and Autograph Journey</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2212" target="_blank">00:36:52.940</a></span> | <span class="t">cards, the Amex Green, the Capital One Saver. So there are a lot of options there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2216" target="_blank">00:36:56.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And then if we wanted the cash back, depends on the mood, I guess. I'm still trying to grapple with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2222" target="_blank">00:37:02.380</a></span> | <span class="t">this experiment where I told myself I'd spend money on cards with cash back this year to see how it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2227" target="_blank">00:37:07.580</a></span> | <span class="t">feels. So stay tuned towards the end of the year when I can debrief on my feelings after doing that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2232" target="_blank">00:37:12.540</a></span> | <span class="t">for a year. But on the cash back side, you've got the Bank of America Premium Rewards Elite card,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2237" target="_blank">00:37:17.100</a></span> | <span class="t">which because I use those points spent on dining for flights ends up being about a 4.4%</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2243" target="_blank">00:37:23.020</a></span> | <span class="t">back card on dining. Now, would I rather have 4 Amex points or 4.4 cents? Probably the Amex points,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2249" target="_blank">00:37:29.020</a></span> | <span class="t">but not a bad card for dining. Next is Groceries. And similarly, I'm still using the 4x Gold card,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2256" target="_blank">00:37:36.300</a></span> | <span class="t">but good alternatives in my wallet are the City Premier at 3x points. And I don't have this card,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2261" target="_blank">00:37:41.500</a></span> | <span class="t">but the Saver card at 3x points as well. And then also, I forgot to mention this in dining,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2265" target="_blank">00:37:45.580</a></span> | <span class="t">but if you're a Verizon customer and you want cash back, the Verizon card I think earns 4%</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2270" target="_blank">00:37:50.220</a></span> | <span class="t">on gas, groceries and dining uncapped. So that's an interesting one if you're a Verizon customer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2275" target="_blank">00:37:55.020</a></span> | <span class="t">though I would argue if you're a Verizon customer, you're probably spending way more on your phone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2279" target="_blank">00:37:59.580</a></span> | <span class="t">bill than an alternative carrier that probably doesn't make up for the extra cash back from that card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2285" target="_blank">00:38:05.020</a></span> | <span class="t">When it comes to travel, there's a bunch of categories within travel and not every card</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2290" target="_blank">00:38:10.220</a></span> | <span class="t">hits them all. So I'll start with the broad all/ other non-flight hotel travel. And in that category,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2297" target="_blank">00:38:17.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the Chase Sapphire Reserve at 3x and the US Bank Altitude Reserve at 4.5% are pretty interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2303" target="_blank">00:38:23.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And they're probably my primary go-to's. But if I had a lot of spend in this category,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2308" target="_blank">00:38:28.380</a></span> | <span class="t">and for whatever reason, I didn't want those cards, getting 3x at Wells Fargo with the Autograph</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2313" target="_blank">00:38:33.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Autograph Journey cards is interesting, though there are limited uses for their points because they have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2317" target="_blank">00:38:37.580</a></span> | <span class="t">smaller number of transfer partners. And then also, as I'm saying this, I'm wondering if given the value</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2323" target="_blank">00:38:43.340</a></span> | <span class="t">I've gotten from transferring built points, yes, it's a 2x travel. But if those 2x are worth 4x,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2328" target="_blank">00:38:48.860</a></span> | <span class="t">then it would kind of accelerate it to be the primary travel card I should use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2332" target="_blank">00:38:52.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm actually questioning my strategy, and I might shift it after this moment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2336" target="_blank">00:38:56.220</a></span> | <span class="t">The Amex green card also does 3x on travel. So that's interesting if you want to stay in the Amex</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2340" target="_blank">00:39:00.620</a></span> | <span class="t">ecosystem. And then on the cashback card, the premium rewards elite card is still, again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2345" target="_blank">00:39:05.100</a></span> | <span class="t">3.5% back on travel if you have platinum honors. And then if you use it for flights, it can be all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2350" target="_blank">00:39:10.300</a></span> | <span class="t">the way up to 4.4%. On flights, I think that there's a hands-down winner that's the platinum</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2357" target="_blank">00:39:17.980</a></span> | <span class="t">card where book a flight directly with airlines, you get 5x points. I have been asked to think about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2363" target="_blank">00:39:23.980</a></span> | <span class="t">whether it's worth not getting the travel protections I would get if I were on another</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2368" target="_blank">00:39:28.780</a></span> | <span class="t">card. And so that's a really important consideration when you're booking travel is how important are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2374" target="_blank">00:39:34.860</a></span> | <span class="t">those travel protections in case you have flight delays, canceled flights, lost bags. So that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2379" target="_blank">00:39:39.580</a></span> | <span class="t">something that I will give more credence to in a future episode. On the hotel side, I'm typically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2386" target="_blank">00:39:46.300</a></span> | <span class="t">using the co-brand cards I have for those hotel chains. But outside of that, it's either the city</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2392" target="_blank">00:39:52.860</a></span> | <span class="t">premier card, which earns 3x on hotels. If I were spending a ton on hotels, I would consider the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2398" target="_blank">00:39:58.860</a></span> | <span class="t">autographed journey card, which is 5x on hotels. And then outside of those, it's just whatever kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2404" target="_blank">00:40:04.620</a></span> | <span class="t">of all travel card. On rental cars, I'm always using the Chase Sapphire Reserve. It has excellent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2409" target="_blank">00:40:09.420</a></span> | <span class="t">rental car coverage. It's primary coverage. It earns 3x points. And I didn't mention that before</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2413" target="_blank">00:40:13.660</a></span> | <span class="t">when I went through that card. But I don't rent enough cards that I'd necessarily say like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2418" target="_blank">00:40:18.540</a></span> | <span class="t">that's the card that I should definitely have.

And my understanding is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2735" target="_blank">00:45:35.100</a></span> | <span class="t">built in the process of trying to make it easier for you to know which ones of those bookings are getting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2741" target="_blank">00:45:41.020</a></span> | <span class="t">booked through NDC so you have that treatment versus not.

If they do,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2747" target="_blank">00:45:47.500</a></span> | <span class="t">you will see me booking all my flights in the portals for elevated earnings.

But until then,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2763" target="_blank">00:46:03.020</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm kind of holding off until I know exactly how it will work.

But since that card is not open, another card that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2772" target="_blank">00:46:12.860</a></span> | <span class="t">interesting is the Venmo card. Because I think in their grocery category, it also includes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2778" target="_blank">00:46:18.300</a></span> | <span class="t">wholesale clubs and it's 3% cash back on everything.

I might think about picking up a Citi Double Cash card to start earning 2x Citi points,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2866" target="_blank">00:47:46.380</a></span> | <span class="t">or just keep using the Bank of America card, which, because we redeem those points for flights,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2870" target="_blank">00:47:50.620</a></span> | <span class="t">it's kind of like a 3.28% cashback card. There aren't a lot of other categories</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2875" target="_blank">00:47:55.100</a></span> | <span class="t">we spend money on right now. The ones that I know do have cards with elevated earnings potential</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2881" target="_blank">00:48:01.180</a></span> | <span class="t">are streaming and entertainment. Obviously, if you have rent, I would strongly encourage you to look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2885" target="_blank">00:48:05.740</a></span> | <span class="t">at the Built card. Allthehacks.com/built is my link. But beyond that, there aren't any categories</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2891" target="_blank">00:48:11.980</a></span> | <span class="t">that I'm necessarily shopping for an elevated earnings card. That said, I will talk about some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2896" target="_blank">00:48:16.700</a></span> | <span class="t">of the new cards I'm looking at this year. And one of them does hit on a category I didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2902" target="_blank">00:48:22.140</a></span> | <span class="t">mention. When it comes to credit cards, I haven't really been distinguishing too clearly between</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2907" target="_blank">00:48:27.420</a></span> | <span class="t">business and personal cards. A year ago, when I recorded the episode for What's In My Wallet 2024,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2913" target="_blank">00:48:33.340</a></span> | <span class="t">I talked a lot about the distinction because we were using QuickBooks. And QuickBooks sucks for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2918" target="_blank">00:48:38.700</a></span> | <span class="t">this. And so we really tried when we were using QuickBooks to completely separate all of our spending</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2923" target="_blank">00:48:43.900</a></span> | <span class="t">so that we only linked certain cards. And it was kind of a mess. And then I started using a product</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2929" target="_blank">00:48:49.260</a></span> | <span class="t">called Kick for our bookkeeping. And it was so amazing that after using it for maybe two weeks,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2935" target="_blank">00:48:55.420</a></span> | <span class="t">I asked if I could invest in the company, which I did. Then I asked if they wanted to sponsor the podcast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2939" target="_blank">00:48:59.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so they did. So totally biased user here as an investor and a partner. But it is amazing at doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2947" target="_blank">00:49:07.100</a></span> | <span class="t">bookkeeping for your business and being able to use business and personal cards, and then just move</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2952" target="_blank">00:49:12.780</a></span> | <span class="t">transactions between them as they don't fall into one or the other, and makes the bookkeeping behind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2958" target="_blank">00:49:18.220</a></span> | <span class="t">it really simple. You can go to allthehacks.com/kick to get a deal there. I think it's 50% off your first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2963" target="_blank">00:49:23.020</a></span> | <span class="t">year of bookkeeping. But that has really made it so that I don't need as much delineation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2968" target="_blank">00:49:28.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So when we have two cards that earn the same amount, like 3x travel on Chase Reserve and the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2972" target="_blank">00:49:32.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Chase thing preferred, then fine, we'll separate them out and make it easy. We do the same thing for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2976" target="_blank">00:49:36.700</a></span> | <span class="t">cashback on Bank of America cards. But when we don't, I'll make a purchase on my personal card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2980" target="_blank">00:49:40.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think from a bookkeeping standpoint, I'm kind of expensing that to the business and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2985" target="_blank">00:49:45.660</a></span> | <span class="t">making that expense a contribution. And if for some reason I put a personal expense on the business card,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2990" target="_blank">00:49:50.940</a></span> | <span class="t">then it's effectively a distribution from the business. Now, obviously, all this happens in the background</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=2995" target="_blank">00:49:55.420</a></span> | <span class="t">with kick, it's not like I have to do all this filing with each transaction. But that's kind of how it happens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3000" target="_blank">00:50:00.540</a></span> | <span class="t">If you don't like that approach, one option is to get two versions of a personal card. So for example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3005" target="_blank">00:50:05.980</a></span> | <span class="t">if you wanted to get 5x points on all flights, whether they're business or personal, and you have a partner,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3011" target="_blank">00:50:11.500</a></span> | <span class="t">then your partner could open up an Amex Platinum. You could open up an Amex Platinum and you use one of the cards</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3016" target="_blank">00:50:16.300</a></span> | <span class="t">all for personal flights and one of the cards all for business flights. Okay, so that's business cards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3019" target="_blank">00:50:19.980</a></span> | <span class="t">What do I want to do next year? What are the cards I'm excited about? Well, if you look at last year,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3024" target="_blank">00:50:24.380</a></span> | <span class="t">in this episode, about 18 months ago, I was excited about the Built Card, the Delta Platinum,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3029" target="_blank">00:50:29.020</a></span> | <span class="t">the Bonvoy Brilliant, Citi cards, the Capital One Saver, the US Bank Altitude Reserve,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3035" target="_blank">00:50:35.260</a></span> | <span class="t">and the Wells Fargo Autograph or Autograph Journey. I ended up getting almost all of those cards. I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3039" target="_blank">00:50:39.580</a></span> | <span class="t">never got the Capital One Saver and I never got the Wells Fargo cards. I didn't really see any elevated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3044" target="_blank">00:50:44.140</a></span> | <span class="t">earnings potential, new kinds of points I'd be able to earn more of. So I passed on them. But I would say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3049" target="_blank">00:50:49.100</a></span> | <span class="t">the cards I was excited about last year, I kind of ended up following through on. So I'm excited to see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3053" target="_blank">00:50:53.660</a></span> | <span class="t">if that happens again this year. So this year, the cards I'm excited about that I don't already have,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3058" target="_blank">00:50:58.060</a></span> | <span class="t">and that is obviously aside from any card with an exciting welcome bonus, which is probably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3063" target="_blank">00:51:03.420</a></span> | <span class="t">something I'm going to focus a lot on this year. But the specific cards I'm interested in are the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3068" target="_blank">00:51:08.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Venmo card I mentioned, because I'm spending a lot lately at Costco on gold. And that card is a great</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3074" target="_blank">00:51:14.380</a></span> | <span class="t">opportunity to get 3%, which gold is expensive, and I might max out on some of the other cards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3079" target="_blank">00:51:19.420</a></span> | <span class="t">I have a companion pass right now. But Amy, my wife does not. And we do have two children. And so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3086" target="_blank">00:51:26.220</a></span> | <span class="t">if I have companion pass, and we're going to do a little bit more Southwest traveling, maybe it makes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3089" target="_blank">00:51:29.980</a></span> | <span class="t">sense for her to get a Southwest card, that signup bonus will get her quite a bit of the ways towards</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3094" target="_blank">00:51:34.380</a></span> | <span class="t">companion pass. She could get two cards, or she could get one and do a little spending or flying.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3099" target="_blank">00:51:39.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But it might be nice if we ended up having two companion passes, then it really is 50% off for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3104" target="_blank">00:51:44.700</a></span> | <span class="t">the family, minus the taxes and fees on the kids, because we'd be able to both have companion pass.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3109" target="_blank">00:51:49.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, the only downside there is, if we wanted to travel together as a couple, we wouldn't actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3114" target="_blank">00:51:54.220</a></span> | <span class="t">be able to benefit from the companion pass, because we would have named our children as our companions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3117" target="_blank">00:51:57.900</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think that is a champagne problem. I mentioned earlier, I'm excited about getting city points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3122" target="_blank">00:52:02.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So as a way to boost them, you might see me add the city double cash, which is a 2% card on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3127" target="_blank">00:52:07.660</a></span> | <span class="t">everything. But those 2% can convert to 2x points. So that might be a way before they go away. I've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3133" target="_blank">00:52:13.020</a></span> | <span class="t">been eyeing the Hawaiian cards, which have a 75,000 point welcome bonus, or at least have in the recent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3138" target="_blank">00:52:18.620</a></span> | <span class="t">past, but also allow you to transfer points between people. And so if we wanted to aggregate all of our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3146" target="_blank">00:52:26.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Alaska points into one account, that would allow us to do that. And who knows what will happen to that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3151" target="_blank">00:52:31.340</a></span> | <span class="t">card after the merger is totally final, which is actually in 26 days right now at the end of June,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3157" target="_blank">00:52:37.740</a></span> | <span class="t">the venture X business, this is a card I'm not eligible for because I have the spark cash plus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3162" target="_blank">00:52:42.620</a></span> | <span class="t">card. But my wife is and for the next five days, they still have a huge 350,000 point signup bonus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3169" target="_blank">00:52:49.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's one that's on a very tight fuse of do we go for this, it has a massive amount of minimum</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3175" target="_blank">00:52:55.180</a></span> | <span class="t">spend to hit that welcome bonus. But when you factor that welcome bonus in, it's a pretty elevated offer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3180" target="_blank">00:53:00.940</a></span> | <span class="t">for a card that I think is interesting. And so we're thinking about it, it hasn't been enough to pull the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3185" target="_blank">00:53:05.740</a></span> | <span class="t">trigger yet. But now we're kind of forced to make that decision. Also, now that Amy's working full time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3191" target="_blank">00:53:11.500</a></span> | <span class="t">on the business, she doesn't actually have a lot of business cards. And so opening up the world of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3195" target="_blank">00:53:15.900</a></span> | <span class="t">business cards to her portfolio is something we haven't done a ton of to date. And so that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3200" target="_blank">00:53:20.060</a></span> | <span class="t">something we're eyeing for this year. Business cards often have really great welcome bonuses. So excited</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3204" target="_blank">00:53:24.620</a></span> | <span class="t">for that. And then the last one is a new card. And I missed out on the opportunity to get a signup</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3210" target="_blank">00:53:30.940</a></span> | <span class="t">bonus for this card because it only lasted for a couple days. But that is the Mesa card. It is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3216" target="_blank">00:53:36.780</a></span> | <span class="t">card for homeowners. So if built is for renters, Mesa is for homeowners. It's a no annual fee card,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3221" target="_blank">00:53:41.900</a></span> | <span class="t">no foreign transaction fee. And the primary benefit is that it earns 1x points on mortgage payments up to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3227" target="_blank">00:53:47.500</a></span> | <span class="t">100,000 points a year. I'm going to do a full breakdown of this card in next week's episode.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3233" target="_blank">00:53:53.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So those are the cards that I'm interested in right now. You might be asking, okay, you just ran through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3240" target="_blank">00:54:00.300</a></span> | <span class="t">and I don't even know the number now easily over 20 cards that we have. And now here's five or six more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3244" target="_blank">00:54:04.780</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm thinking of how do I keep track of this? And so the way I'll close out this episode is just share</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3249" target="_blank">00:54:09.340</a></span> | <span class="t">a little bit about how I keep track of all my cards. And so there are a handful of apps that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3254" target="_blank">00:54:14.700</a></span> | <span class="t">make this a lot easier. There's card pointers, card right, travel freely. I think you might be able</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3259" target="_blank">00:54:19.980</a></span> | <span class="t">to do this with a ward wallet or the points guy app. And of course you can create your own spreadsheet</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3264" target="_blank">00:54:24.380</a></span> | <span class="t">to do this as well. Personally, I really liked the card pointers app and I've used it for a long time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3269" target="_blank">00:54:29.900</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's easy to use. I think it does a lot more than what you need it to do when you think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3275" target="_blank">00:54:35.340</a></span> | <span class="t">how do I manage this? And I'm not saying you can't use the other ones, but I'll tell you why I like the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3279" target="_blank">00:54:39.900</a></span> | <span class="t">app and why I decided to partner with card pointers to get a discount for all of you because I think it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3284" target="_blank">00:54:44.860</a></span> | <span class="t">has a ton of value. So first you could just put all your cards in and you could do it without having</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3289" target="_blank">00:54:49.740</a></span> | <span class="t">to link your bank. So you could just say, I have an Amex Platinum and then it's added to your app and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3295" target="_blank">00:54:55.020</a></span> | <span class="t">they keep track of all the perks and the benefits of that card because the app knows what the perks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3300" target="_blank">00:55:00.380</a></span> | <span class="t">and benefits are of an Amex Platinum. Now, if you go in and tell it, here's the date I signed up for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3304" target="_blank">00:55:04.940</a></span> | <span class="t">that card and then they'll know here's when your annual fees due and all that kind of stuff. So there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3309" target="_blank">00:55:09.020</a></span> | <span class="t">a view in the app where I could say, show me the calendar of all my upcoming annual fees so I can keep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3313" target="_blank">00:55:13.500</a></span> | <span class="t">track on maybe I want to cancel a card before that happens. Maybe I want to call up and see if there's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3317" target="_blank">00:55:17.740</a></span> | <span class="t">retention offer, anything like that. It's also great because if you set it up with a partner,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3322" target="_blank">00:55:22.300</a></span> | <span class="t">you can manage your and your partner's cards and you can actually give them a view, which is just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3328" target="_blank">00:55:28.300</a></span> | <span class="t">here's the best card to use for different kinds of spending. So instead of maybe printing something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3332" target="_blank">00:55:32.620</a></span> | <span class="t">out or putting labels on cards, you could say, Hey, look at the card pointers app and it'll tell you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3336" target="_blank">00:55:36.460</a></span> | <span class="t">groceries, this card, gas, this card. So I like that. But the two things that I love the most is one,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3342" target="_blank">00:55:42.940</a></span> | <span class="t">it is the place that I can manage all of the offers. And actually,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3346" target="_blank">00:55:46.940</a></span> | <span class="t">this is two things, but it's one thing. It's all the standard offers and all the personal offers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3351" target="_blank">00:55:51.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And the difference being the standard offers are all the things that come with your cards,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3355" target="_blank">00:55:55.500</a></span> | <span class="t">your $10 a month dining credit, $50 resi credit, Hilton resort credits, all that kind of stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3359" target="_blank">00:55:59.980</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a lot to keep track of. And so they have them all there. I can go in and I favorite all the offers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3366" target="_blank">00:56:06.780</a></span> | <span class="t">that I like. And then I can say, filter this view for standard offers that I favorited, sort them by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3371" target="_blank">00:56:11.580</a></span> | <span class="t">soon as to expire. And I can just scroll through a list of here's all the things I want to make sure I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3376" target="_blank">00:56:16.140</a></span> | <span class="t">take advantage of before the end of the month, quarter or year. And it's how I make sure I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3380" target="_blank">00:56:20.620</a></span> | <span class="t">lose track of the value I'm getting from all the cards I have. There's also personal offers. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3385" target="_blank">00:56:25.740</a></span> | <span class="t">those are the card linked offers you get. So with the browser extension from card pointers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3390" target="_blank">00:56:30.700</a></span> | <span class="t">anytime you log into your bank, it's going to one, check all of those offers and add them to the list.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3397" target="_blank">00:56:37.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So you make sure you know about them, but it's also going to add them to your card. But the really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3401" target="_blank">00:56:41.580</a></span> | <span class="t">cool thing it's going to do is if you were to go add an Amex offer to one card, they'd usually take</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3407" target="_blank">00:56:47.340</a></span> | <span class="t">it away from another card. So you couldn't add it to both. But if you hit their server at the exact same</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3411" target="_blank">00:56:51.740</a></span> | <span class="t">time for all your cards, you can add that card to multiple cards all at once. And so that's something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3417" target="_blank">00:56:57.420</a></span> | <span class="t">the card pointers extension also does. And so it does all this without downloading your balance data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3422" target="_blank">00:57:02.860</a></span> | <span class="t">and storing your login as well, which is really cool. And so that extension not only knows about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3428" target="_blank">00:57:08.860</a></span> | <span class="t">all those offers, but then it alerts you. So the other day we were on the site Chewy to order some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3434" target="_blank">00:57:14.380</a></span> | <span class="t">things for our dog. And it popped up and said, Hey, just so you know, you should use one of these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3438" target="_blank">00:57:18.460</a></span> | <span class="t">two chase cards, which has a 15 off $49 purchase, which can be up to 30% cash back. I promise you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3445" target="_blank">00:57:25.740</a></span> | <span class="t">that if I had not seen that notification from the card pointers extension, I would have used a different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3449" target="_blank">00:57:29.740</a></span> | <span class="t">card and I definitely would have gotten 30% off my purchase. And so that extension has probably saved me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3455" target="_blank">00:57:35.660</a></span> | <span class="t">at least a thousand dollars. And now I'm also using the app to basically favorite offers that I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3461" target="_blank">00:57:41.900</a></span> | <span class="t">notice like Chewy as an example. Oh, we're going to use that. Oh, here's a store that we regularly shop</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3467" target="_blank">00:57:47.020</a></span> | <span class="t">from. Let's not forget that there's an offer that expires in two months for $30 off $100 or something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3472" target="_blank">00:57:52.780</a></span> | <span class="t">like that. So I'm able to make sure that I'm not only getting all the benefits from the perks that are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3476" target="_blank">00:57:56.860</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of recurring regular perks of the card, but all the card linked offers. And I went and looked at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3481" target="_blank">00:58:01.900</a></span> | <span class="t">different cards I have and there are cards where I've gotten five, six, $700 of card linked offer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3486" target="_blank">00:58:06.700</a></span> | <span class="t">value from that card. And I'm certain I would have gotten that before. So I worked with Emmanuel,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3491" target="_blank">00:58:11.500</a></span> | <span class="t">the founder, who's a member of all the hacks.

It's an app. I open up multiple times a week. I've got the extension running all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3509" target="_blank">00:58:29.740</a></span> | <span class="t">time and I love it.

And the way they implemented it was a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3525" target="_blank">00:58:45.260</a></span> | <span class="t">way that at least from a security standpoint, I just wasn't comfortable with. I've shared this with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3529" target="_blank">00:58:49.900</a></span> | <span class="t">them. I checked again, six or seven months later, they hadn't changed anything. If they ever do,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3534" target="_blank">00:58:54.860</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm happy to try the app again. But until then, like, I just can't review that product because I do not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3540" target="_blank">00:59:00.380</a></span> | <span class="t">trust the way that they've implemented the linking with my bank. I've emailed with the team. I don't believe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3545" target="_blank">00:59:05.980</a></span> | <span class="t">they're doing anything nefarious. I think they are probably just implementing it in a way that was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3550" target="_blank">00:59:10.460</a></span> | <span class="t">easiest for their engineering team to do, but I'm just not comfortable with it. And so I can't review</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=583me0rAARQ&t=3555" target="_blank">00:59:15.260</a></span> | <span class="t">it.
