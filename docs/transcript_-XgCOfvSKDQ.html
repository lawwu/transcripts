It's another episode of All In Podcast, the podcast that is racing up the charts, despite the fact that we recorded every three or four weeks. There's no marketing, there's no ads in this podcast. It's just four friends who play poker together, who've decided to talk about the most important issues in the world. Welcome back to the podcast, David Friedberg, the queen of quinoa himself, obviously climate.com, Eatsa, and an undisclosed beverage startup that I'm not supposed to talk about. Sorry about that. I know a lot of people were tweeting about this beverage startup. You're still not ready to talk about the beverage startup. Thank you, Jake Powell. Yeah. Welcome back to the show. I always appreciate your promotions. But when will the beverage startup- By the way, do you guys want to talk about Jason's home address? Because I have that, I think. Please, no. I want to ask, is that a picture in the background? I love space, by the way, as you know, but is that a picture of Uranus or what is that picture? I think that's Saturn. Saturn. It's Saturn. It's Saturn. It's not Uranus. I think it's Saturn. No, it's Saturn. Friedberg, obviously taking the first Virgin Galactic flight. Chamath Palihapiti, of course, with us here. The prince of SPACs calling in from an undisclosed location that is not burning down like the United States. How are you doing on your vacay? Doing really well. Thanks. I'm giving you the three-button salute, as I told you. Yeah, thank God the microphone is perfectly positioned. Thank you. So we do not have to look at your chest hair, all six of your chest hairs. Oh my God. It's like a thousand-dollar suit that's missing all of its buttons, or shirt, rather. I mean, they couldn't afford to put buttons all the way up on your, like, probably $2,000 shirt. Austerity measures. When I get back to the United States, as Jason said, my haberdasher will meet me at plain sight and slow the three buttons off. Yeah, when he leaves for Europe, they remove the three buttons, he comes back, the haberdasher puts him back on each shirt. He does that for the three buttons. Yeah, he does that for the entire wardrobe. And, of course, chiming in is Rain Man himself, David Sachs, professional blogger, and the fund manager of Kraft Ventures. Of course, before that, working at PayPal with Peter Thiel, Elon Musk, and a bunch of other famous people, two of which have gone on to have demonstrably more success than Sachs, but Sachs having, of course, more than success, demonstrable success than the other 72 rocket science. from PayPal. In between, he did a little company called Yammer, which Microsoft bought for a billion dollars. Speaking of big companies and big tech, we had a big tech hearing this week, and Jeff Bezos, Sundar, and Zuck himself, as well as Tim Cook, two founders, and two hired guns, people who were hired for their positions, defending themselves from what I thought was some pretty good questioning. My expectations were very low that anybody on that panel would know what they were talking about. For me, I thought Jeff Bezos did the best job. He had a great opening statement, and he was the most candid, and I think least likely to get broken up. Going around the horn here, Chamath, who did the best job in the hearings? I don't know if you saw all of them or just clips, but who do you think shined? I only saw, to be honest with you, your recap, which I thought was, frankly, really, really good. We should probably link to that in the show notes so people can listen to it. I saw a couple of answers. The thing that jumped off the page to me was I read a little bit of Bezos' statement. I thought it was pretty fire. I thought he did the best job positioning himself, but the reality is it's kind of what I said a few days earlier on CNBC, but I just thought going in, this whole thing was set up to be kind of performative theater, and it basically was that. The level of questions are just so poor. The level of understanding is so bad, and then people just use it as a way to grandstand, and everybody did. I wasn't completely blown away by any of it, to be quite honest. What do you think, Friedberg? Who had the best showing in those hearings? I think Zuck was the most eloquent in the on-point responses. He was super, super well-prepped for this thing. I think Bezos and others were obviously, they had great kind of prep work done for their statement, but in terms of warding off the attacks, I think Zuck did a great job. It was weird. It didn't feel like Tim Cook should have been there. It was kind of a random thing that he was there, because everyone had an ax to grind, and the ax that everyone had to grind was a little bit different. It wasn't like this was a true objective discussion about antitrust, and so the ax that people had to grind were kind of pointed at Google and Facebook and Amazon in different ways. Tim Cook was kind of, hey, yeah, this is cool. You guys go ahead and give your responses. I'm going to go back to work. And do you think that's because Apple does not have a monopoly position on a numbers basis in any one era? No. And or because their products are so loved and universally used? Well, I think it's actually a function of what these companies do. So if you look at the Jim Jordan rant, I don't know if you guys watched this, but Jim Jordan did this big rant at the opening. He's the worst. And he went on and on. And the first thing he said, he's like, big tech is out to get conservatives. And then he went on and gave all these examples about how Twitter has been pulling down Donald Trump's tweets and flagging them, and Facebook's been canceling certain people on the platform. And his whole axe to grind was really about censorship on social media platforms, which has fucking nothing to do with antitrust and has nothing to do with Apple's business. And so yeah, I guess my point is like, and then other people have issues with with the with Google's dominance and ads and Amazon's impact on local business. And so there wasn't much of an axe to grind, frankly, with Apple. At the end of the day, as I said, I just don't think that it was a function of, you know, a true kind of objective antitrust approach. And it was just more about like, hey, we've all got different interests. Yeah. Yeah. We've got different things we want to address. And we finally got these guys here, let's beat them up. And, you know, Sacks, what do you think you with freeberg that it was performance art? Or do you think that or performative rather, do you or do you think that there are actually substantive issues that came up during the hearings that we should discuss here? Well, you know, it was both, you know, certainly, there was a tremendous amount of grandstanding in political theater. And the politicians on both sides wanted to take shots at the companies for various reasons. I mean, I think they have a slightly different hierarchy of hate. I think the left sort of hates Facebook the most because they blame it for Trump's election, which I think is kind of a ridiculous scapegoating, which we should talk more about. But and then I think the right is is most suspicious towards Google. But I think there are legitimate issues here as that were brought up. And I think the congressional hearing did score some hit points. Your previous pod did a good job showing some of those. The these hearings were teed up apparently over the past year by a series of subpoenas of records that the committee. This is the this is the House subcommittee on antitrust had teed up. And so there were some moments where I thought that, you know, the representation. I think the Senate has scored some hits on Facebook and Google. What do you think the big who took the biggest hit in all of this? Who who do you think has the most putting aside all this performance, obviously, and the politicization of everything in our country? And Jim Jordan, who to me is like the he's like the dad at the baseball game who like the little league game who runs on the court and pushes the empire and gets banned for the season. Like he just yells over everybody for no reason. But right. What is the actual? What is the punch that landed? That is the most valid as we go around the horn one more time here. Now that we got our initial thoughts about it, what punch landed the squarest in one of these companies faces? Well, I mean, let me set this up. I think there were three big areas of concern where just about all the companies, with maybe the exception of Amazon, took hits, although even, you know, Bezos took hits. I think one is with respect to anti competitive actions that these platforms are taking. I think one is with respect to the applications or small businesses that operate and are dependent on those platforms. I think all of the companies were interrogated about that. You know, Bezos took a hit when he had to admit there were concede that the company may not have always followed his policy with respect to using its third party sellers data to figure out how to compete with them. You know, Google was interrogated about snippets. There was news today, actually, just out of Australia that the government's going to order a new version of Amazon. I think that's a big one. I think that's a big one. I think that's a big one. I think that's a big one. I think that's a big one. I think that's a big one. I think that's a big one. I think that's a big one.

I think that's a big one. I think that's a big one. I think that's a big one. I think that's a big one. I think what a more logical and defensible reaction ... I just think it's not defensible to say, "Oh, you know what, Facebook? I didn't like the acquisition you did 10 years ago, basically because it worked, and so I'm going to punish you 10 years later." That's crazy. That's stupid. Yeah. In the review mirror, no. No good. Yeah. A more reasonable place to be is to say, "Okay, this thing," meaning communications writ large, "has become a critical piece of societal infrastructure, and we are trying to figure out now what the rule of thumb is." What the rule of thumb should be. Rules shouldn't be brittle. Rules should be evolutionary. They should map to the moral decisions and ideas and frameworks of the time. We have to figure out, for example, number one, interoperability. How can you message across all these multiple networks? Another simple example, we legislated the ability for emergency services to be able to send a message on your mobile phone line and your landline. You should probably be able to have a backdoor into all the messaging. That works simply for that reason. The point is that there are all kinds of things you can do today to make this infrastructure layer of society operate in a more predictable way on behalf of ... What was your best ... Have you thought about a regulation? Then let's stick to Facebook, and then we'll go to Amazon. Chamath, have you thought about a regulation that would make sense to Facebook? Whether it's divesting an asset or maybe a certain percentage of usage or allowing Facebook Messenger to work with iMessenger to work with Twitter DMs? I'll answer it in a different way. For 20 years, I've run these kinds of businesses, from Winamp to AIM and ICQ to then at Facebook. I remember at AIM and ICQ, we did all this hand-wringing and all these meetings between us and Microsoft and Yahoo to make our messaging networks interoperate. Eventually, we were basically just cut off at the knees. Other people just moved around us. Eventually, it all just morphed anyways away from these sort of brittle messaging networks. My kind of view is that I think what's best for Facebook is a status quo. Yeah. If they can basically ... By the way, I think the strategy is ... Mark wrote this in his manifesto, but a couple of years ago, this is sort of what led to Chris Cox resigning, if I'm playing sort of like conspiracy theorist. If you read Zuck's manifesto ... What he was basically saying is, "Listen, we're going to take all these product, and we're going to take all that code, and we're going to mesh them all together in such a complicated convoluted mess that if and when somebody ever tells us to rip it apart, it'll take another five or 10 years to do it." That's effectively the technical read on that manifesto. It's just like you're going to make it technically impossible to unthread these things as independent ... Your thesis is that's a strategy against an antitrust breakup. I find that ... No, I just think it's a really smart strategy. He wrote it, and he published it online, so it's not like he's hiding anything. He made it ... This is the beautiful part about it. He made it completely in the clear. That's the strategy, is to basically make it one monolithic code base, so that if and when ... I'm not sure if this is the intention, but frankly, if and when somebody knocked on the door and said, "Hey, you need to strip apart WhatsApp and Messenger and Instagram," you can say, "Well, look. It's one monolithic code base. 50 million lines of code. It'll take me 10 years, but sure, I'll figure it out somehow." I think what's good for Facebook is a status quo. Now that's different from what's good for politicians, and then what's different for consumers. I think what's good for consumers is fundamental interoperability. Now this is then what touches Android and Apple as well. The idea today that you cannot have a group text message that can only include iPhones, on the off-chain ... Right. ... and then you can't have a group text message that can only include iPhones. Right. You can't have a group text message that can only include iPhones. Right.
