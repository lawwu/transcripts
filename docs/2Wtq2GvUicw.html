data scrubbing type of application but we're going to use LLMs and we're going to see that we can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wtq2GvUicw&t=212"

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wtq2GvUicw&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.560</a></span> | <span class="t">compact very lightweight models that have been fine-tuned for that very task so again trying to motivate this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wtq2GvUicw&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">talk what limits gen AI adoption in most businesses today based on the conversations that I've had in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wtq2GvUicw&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.640</a></span> | <span class="t">field discussions I've had customers and developers the first one is there's a limited availability of GPUs I think we're all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wtq2GvUicw&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.220</a></span> | <span class="t">familiar with this problem it's one of the reasons why Nvidia is so successful lately I mean everyone wants</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wtq2GvUicw&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">to have access to those precious resources that allow us to run gen AI at scale and that can also drive costs up right so we have to be smart about how to use those GPU resources</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wtq2GvUicw&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and also when people build POCs it displays and shows promise but sometimes you don't reach the expected quality bar to go to production</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wtq2GvUicw&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.540</a></span> | <span class="t">and so on this XY axis you know on this chart where Y axis is costs and the X axis symbolizes quality maybe many people start on that green cross here right on this upper quadrant a very high cost maybe not having met the quality bar that's your first POC</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wtq2GvUicw&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">POC but really to go to production you need to end on the opposite quadrant right lower cost higher quality where you met the bar you're able to run this in a way that essentially is margin positive and many of us are on this journey to reach that point of you know profitability</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wtq2GvUicw&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.240</a></span> | <span class="t">so we're going to learn today how to use and how to fine tune an LL M now fine tuning is a method that we're going to use to improve the LL M quality but as a bonus we're going to be also showing how to improve quality significantly and I use quality as the title of this talk because really I think many of us AI engineers really care about reaching the high quality bar when we're using LL M's and hopefully I'm you know the goal of today's talk is to instill</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wtq2GvUicw&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">instill you with some knowledge on how to tackle this journey and so in terms of tools that we're going to use today we're going to use OpenPipe which is a SaaS solution for fine tuning that really lowers the barrier of entry for people to run their own fine tunes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wtq2GvUicw&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you don't need hardware or cloud instances you don't need hardware or cloud instances to get started and we're going to use this to deliver quality improvements over state-of-the-art LL M's and of course since I work at Octo AI I'm going to also be using Octo AI here for the LL M deployments</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wtq2GvUicw&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and that's going to be the solution that we're going to use to achieve cost efficiency at scale and really the key here is to be able to build on a solution that is designed to serve models at production scale volumes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wtq2GvUicw&t=382" target="_blank">00:06:22.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and just to give you a little bit of a sneak peek in terms of the results that we're going to showcase today after you go through this whole tutorial and this is something that you're going to be able to reproduce independently so you know all the code</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wtq2GvUicw&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.120</a></span> | <span class="t">is there for you to go through we're going to be able to show that we can achieve 47 percent better accuracy at the tasks that I'm going to showcase today using this OpenPipe fine tuning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wtq2GvUicw&t=404" target="_blank">00:06:44.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and by deploying the model on Octo AI we're going to achieve this I mean it seems kind of ridiculous 99.5 percent reduction in cost this is really a 200x reduction in cost here from a GPT-4 Turbo to Llama 3 and mostly because this is a much smaller model it's open source and we've optimized the hell of this model to serve it cheaply on Octo AI so I'm going to explain how this is achieved but I hope your interest at least has been peaked on those results that you yourself</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wtq2GvUicw&t=434" target="_blank">00:07:14.040</a></span> | <span class="t">can reproduce so when to use fine tuning again it's not really a silver bullet for all your quality problems it has its right place in time so I like to contextualize it within the crawl walk run of quality optimization right and as Gen AI engineers many of us have embarked on this journey we're at different stages of this journey and really it should always start with prompt engineering right and many of you are familiar with this concept you start with a model you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wtq2GvUicw&t=463" target="_blank">00:07:43.960</a></span> | <span class="t">you're trying to have it accomplish a task and sometimes you don't really manage to see the result you expect to see so you're going to try prompt engineering and there's different techniques of varying levels of sophistication</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wtq2GvUicw&t=475" target="_blank">00:07:55.320</a></span> | <span class="t">this talk is not about prompt engineering so you know you can improve prompt specificity there's few shots prompting where you can provide examples to improve essentially the quality of your output there's also chain of thought prompting I mean some of you probably have heard these concepts but this is where you should get started right make sure that given the model given those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wtq2GvUicw&t=493" target="_blank">00:08:13.880</a></span> | <span class="t">you just try to improve those weights you just try to improve the prompt to get the right results sometimes that's not enough and there's a second class of solutions which I like to map to the walk stage</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wtq2GvUicw&t=503" target="_blank">00:08:23.720</a></span> | <span class="t">retreatal augmented generation right we've probably seen a lot of talks on RAG today and throughout this conference so you know there's hallucinated results sometimes the answer is not truthful well why is that it's because the weights of the model that is really the parametric memory of your model is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wtq2GvUicw&t=523" target="_blank">00:08:43.800</a></span> | <span class="t">is limited to you know the point in time is limited to you know the point in time in which the model was trained so when you try to ask questions on data it hasn't seen or information that's more recent than when the model was trained it's not going to know how to respond right so the key here is to provide the right amount of context</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wtq2GvUicw&t=539" target="_blank">00:08:59.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and so this is achieved through similar research for instance in a vector database through function calling to bring the right context by invoking an API through search through querying a database</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wtq2GvUicw&t=551" target="_blank">00:09:11.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and so this is something that I think many of us engineers have been diving in in order to provide the right context to generate truthful answer right compliment the parametric memory of your model with non parametric information</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wtq2GvUicw&t=563" target="_blank">00:09:23.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and that's RAG in a nutshell right so you've tried prompt engineering you've tried RAG you've eliminated quality</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wtq2GvUicw&t=568" target="_blank">00:09:28.920</a></span> | <span class="t">problems and hallucinations but that's still not enough right so what do you try next</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wtq2GvUicw&t=573" target="_blank">00:09:33.640</a></span> | <span class="t">well fine-tuning I think is the next stage and again I'm generalizing a very complicated and complex journey</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wtq2GvUicw&t=580" target="_blank">00:09:40.840</a></span> | <span class="t">but in spite of your best efforts you've tried these techniques for maybe days weeks or even months</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wtq2GvUicw&t=586" target="_blank">00:09:46.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and you still don't get to where you need to be to hit production and we're going to talk about this journey</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wtq2GvUicw&t=591" target="_blank">00:09:51.560</a></span> | <span class="t">today right fine-tuning so when should you fine-tune a model again after you spend a

it's the perfect match</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wtq2GvUicw&t=2813" target="_blank">00:46:53.560</a></span> | <span class="t">or fine-tune
