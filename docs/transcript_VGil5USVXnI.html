It's for the choir director of David, a Psalm. I hoped earnestly for Yahweh and he inclined to me and heard my cry for help. He brought me up out of the pit of destruction, out of the miry clay, and he set my feet upon a high rock.</p><p>He established my steps. He put a new song in my mouth, a song of praise to our God. Many will see and fear and will trust in Yahweh. How blessed is the man who has made Yahweh his trust and has not turned to the proud, nor to those who stray in the falsehood.</p><p>Many, oh Yahweh, my God, are the wondrous deeds you have done. Your thoughts towards us, there's none to compare with you. I would declare and speak of them, but they are too numerous to recount. Sacrifice and meal offering you have not desired. My ears you have opened, burnt offering and sin offering you have not required.</p><p>Then I said, behold, I come in the scroll of the book it is written of me. I desire to do your will, oh my God. Your law is within my inner being. I proclaim the good news of righteousness in the great assembly. Behold, I do not restrain my lips, oh Yahweh.</p><p>You know. I do not conceal your righteousness within my heart. I speak of your faithfulness and your salvation. I do not hide your loving kindness and your truth from the great assembly. You, oh Yahweh, will not withhold your compassion from me. Your loving kindness and your truth will continually guard me for evils beyond number have surrounded me.</p><p>My iniquities have overtaken me so that I am not able to see they are more numerous than the hairs of my head and my heart has failed me. Be pleased, oh Yahweh, to deliver me. Make haste, oh Yahweh, to help me. Let those be ashamed and humiliated together who seek my life to sweep it away.</p><p>Let those be turned back and dishonored who delight in evil against me. Let those be appalled because of their shame who say to me, aha, aha. Let all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you. Let those who love your salvation say continually, Yahweh, be magnified. As for me, I'm afflicted and needy.</p><p>May the Lord think of me. You're my help and the one who rescues me. Do not delay, oh my God. (silence)</p></div></div></body></html>
