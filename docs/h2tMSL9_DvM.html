target="_blank">00:01:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">How would you put those two pieces together?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2tMSL9_DvM&t=82" target="_blank">00:01:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, let's get the whole textual picture in front of us.</span></div><div

those two apparently contradictory passages,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2tMSL9_DvM&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and that would include Matthew 10, 19.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2tMSL9_DvM&t=96" target="_blank">00:01:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, all three of the texts that I'm going to mention, two of which Scott already mentioned,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2tMSL9_DvM&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">all three of them picture the Christian life in a hostile setting,</span></div><div

faith.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2tMSL9_DvM&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what it's addressing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2tMSL9_DvM&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, incredibly relevant, incredibly relevant for our day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2tMSL9_DvM&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Luke 21, 14, "Settle it, therefore, in your minds not to meditate beforehand how to answer."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2tMSL9_DvM&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to come back to that because there are alternative translations than the word "meditate" there,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2tMSL9_DvM&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but there it is, "not to meditate beforehand how to answer, for I will give you a mouth and wisdom</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2tMSL9_DvM&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">which none of your adversaries will be able to withstand."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2tMSL9_DvM&t=139" target="_blank">00:02:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the one that Scott didn't mention is Matthew 10, 19, which says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2tMSL9_DvM&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"When they deliver you over, do not be anxious how you are to speak or what you are to say."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2tMSL9_DvM&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then comes the one from 1 Peter, "In your hearts, honor Christ the Lord as holy."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2tMSL9_DvM&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Always, always, always being prepared, not just getting ready the night before,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2tMSL9_DvM&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason that I hope that is in you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2tMSL9_DvM&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So what Scott sees, rightly, is an apparent tension or contradiction between Luke,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2tMSL9_DvM&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"not meditate beforehand how to answer," and 1 Peter, "always be prepared to make a defense."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2tMSL9_DvM&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's state the obvious first and make sure we don't miss the forest for the trees.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2tMSL9_DvM&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The aim of these texts is to bear a faithful witness, that we bear a faithful witness to the truth and the glory of Jesus Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2tMSL9_DvM&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This will include facts about him, and it will include some kind of explanation for why we believe in him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2tMSL9_DvM&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's also clear, it seems to me at least, that we approach this chance to witness in our lives,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2tMSL9_DvM&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">we approach this with trust in God for his help because he has promised that he would help us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2tMSL9_DvM&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"I will give you a mouth and wisdom," and so on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2tMSL9_DvM&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In that way, then, we will honor him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2tMSL9_DvM&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He will get the glory, not only for what we say, but for the fact that we've trusted him to help us say it and to show us what we should say.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2tMSL9_DvM&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, to me, the most difficult question here is not first how 1 Peter 3 and Luke 21 fit together, but what does Luke 21 14 even mean?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2tMSL9_DvM&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The ESV translates "settle it, therefore, in your minds not to meditate beforehand how to answer."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2tMSL9_DvM&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, it's not completely clear where the emphasis falls here in this Greek word, "prameloton."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2tMSL9_DvM&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It might carry a heavy emphasis on "don't practice your speech ahead of time," because that's what the word was used for in some context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2tMSL9_DvM&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I looked them up yesterday just to see if that was so, that this word was used for practicing your speech before you gave it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2tMSL9_DvM&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it might have an emphasis there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2tMSL9_DvM&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Or it may carry a connotation of anxious preparation because the world is going to hate you and not care at all about what you have to say.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2tMSL9_DvM&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the word "prameloton" has that "melaton" word in it that does mean "carry a special care" or "be anxious."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2tMSL9_DvM&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, in view of those possibilities, I'm inclined to let Matthew 10 19 shape the way I see Luke 21 14.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2tMSL9_DvM&t=328" target="_blank">00:05:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So Matthew 10 19 says, "When they deliver you up, do not be anxious."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2tMSL9_DvM&t=334" target="_blank">00:05:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Luke didn't say anxious. Luke just said don't meditate ahead of time or don't practice ahead of time or don't give a lot of attention ahead of time to how you put everything together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2tMSL9_DvM&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This says, "Don't be anxious how you are to speak or what you are to say, for the Lord will give you in that hour what you are to say."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2tMSL9_DvM&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it seems to me that Jesus is warning against excessive, anxious, overly scripted, rhetorically planned preparation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2tMSL9_DvM&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's a good exercise to think about yourself lying in prison the night before your trial.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2tMSL9_DvM&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What would God want you to be thinking about and praying about?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2tMSL9_DvM&t=375" target="_blank">00:06:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, ask that question.
