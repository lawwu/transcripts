So to use your specific example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4wWQMOKlwI&t=898" target="_blank">00:14:58.840</a></span> | <span class="t">if I put in a ticket, if you want an order to send you a Bitcoin or half a Bitcoin or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4wWQMOKlwI&t=905" target="_blank">00:15:05.080</a></span> | <span class="t">a third of a Bitcoin, it goes into a pool. And then these computers around the world,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4wWQMOKlwI&t=911" target="_blank">00:15:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">they take all the people who want to send Bitcoin from person A to person B.

That's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4wWQMOKlwI&t=925" target="_blank">00:15:25.880</a></span> | <span class="t">where the word blockchain comes from.

And the way mining works</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4wWQMOKlwI&t=937" target="_blank">00:15:37.400</a></span> | <span class="t">is everyone's racing.

Those transactions are finalized</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4wWQMOKlwI&t=942" target="_blank">00:15:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and then they do it all again. And every 10 minutes, a new block is processed. But it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4wWQMOKlwI&t=946" target="_blank">00:15:46.680</a></span> | <span class="t">the same thing banks are doing.

They try to figure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4wWQMOKlwI&t=967" target="_blank">00:16:07.480</a></span> | <span class="t">out what the key is to verify all of these things. And if they're actually the winner,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4wWQMOKlwI&t=975" target="_blank">00:16:15.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and by the way, this takes a tremendous amount of power, a tremendous amount of computing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4wWQMOKlwI&t=979" target="_blank">00:16:19.480</a></span> | <span class="t">power.

And when a miner verifies</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4wWQMOKlwI&t=993" target="_blank">00:16:33.280</a></span> | <span class="t">that it's all correct and they find the key, they're the ones who get to the key first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4wWQMOKlwI&t=1000" target="_blank">00:16:40.120</a></span> | <span class="t">because there's all these competing miners out there trying to get to that same key.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4wWQMOKlwI&t=1004" target="_blank">00:16:44.280</a></span> | <span class="t">They get the key.
