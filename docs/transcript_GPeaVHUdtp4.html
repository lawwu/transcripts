One deals pop up all the time, even for primetime travel. I was looking for flights to Europe for five people direct in business class in the summer, which is a very hard time to find awards. I got multiple options in the 45 to 75, 80,000 point range for that over the course of a couple of weeks on short notice, takeaway number two, don't forget that because you find a flight on one airline, like United in my case, it absolutely does not mean you need to book it through United's award program.</p><p>And in many cases, it's going to be a much worse deal. Takeaway number three, there is so much value in having transferable points, especially across multiple programs. In my example, if I didn't have chase points, then I wouldn't have gotten the 20% aero plan transfer bonus, or have even been able to transfer to United.</p><p>If that was the best option, if I didn't have Amex points, I couldn't you've gotten the 15% bonus to life miles.</p></div></div></body></html>
