I think of this computer, think of it like a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ0yNMnvwqY&t=1994" target="_blank">00:33:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">computer game.

And so you then sit at that table. So that table, we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ0yNMnvwqY&t=2007" target="_blank">00:33:27.400</a></span> | <span class="t">would say it's red, right? And you have to assume that everything that you haven't personally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ0yNMnvwqY&t=2013" target="_blank">00:33:33.320</a></span> | <span class="t">cleaned thoroughly is red because you don't know if it is or it isn't, right? So that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ0yNMnvwqY&t=2018" target="_blank">00:33:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">your red. So you have to assume that's red. So you go to a table at a restaurant, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ0yNMnvwqY&t=2022" target="_blank">00:33:42.760</a></span> | <span class="t">sit down and your hand touches it. So now think of a computer game where like every</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ0yNMnvwqY&t=2027" target="_blank">00:33:47.240</a></span> | <span class="t">time something touches a red thing, it becomes red as well. So your hand touches the table,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ0yNMnvwqY&t=2031" target="_blank">00:33:51.960</a></span> | <span class="t">it's now red, by which I mean potentially infected. You pick up your phone, bing, that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ0yNMnvwqY&t=2039" target="_blank">00:33:59.080</a></span> | <span class="t">now red.

You</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ0yNMnvwqY&t=2045" target="_blank">00:34:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">pick it up off the desk and then you put your computer where it was sitting, bing, that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ0yNMnvwqY&t=2049" target="_blank">00:34:09.240</a></span> | <span class="t">now red. Right? So that's kind of like how you have to think about this. And so the thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ0yNMnvwqY&t=2053" target="_blank">00:34:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">is now you then say like, oh, forgot to wash my hands after I went out to the restaurant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ0yNMnvwqY&t=2060" target="_blank">00:34:20.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So you clean them and hands are now green.
