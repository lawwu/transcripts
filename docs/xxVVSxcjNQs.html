Hi, everybody, and welcome. I am here with JJ Allaire. My name is Jeremy Howard,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=6" target="_blank">00:00:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and we are having what I originally was very proud of myself for inventing the idea of a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=12" target="_blank">00:00:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">two-way AMA. I wondered why other people haven't come up with this idea, and then I realized,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=18" target="_blank">00:00:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">oh, I think I just invented another name for a conversation. So this is either a conversation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=23" target="_blank">00:00:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">with JJ Allaire or a two-way AMA. We'll see if it turns out to be any different.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=28" target="_blank">00:00:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So, good day, JJ. Thanks for joining. Great being here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=32" target="_blank">00:00:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So I always like to find out a little bit about people's environs. Where are you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=42" target="_blank">00:00:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">talking to us from today? I'm talking from my home in Newton, Massachusetts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=48" target="_blank">00:00:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">In Newton, Massachusetts? Newton, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=51" target="_blank">00:00:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And where is that? It's like, it's kind of due east, due west of the city, sorry,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=59" target="_blank">00:00:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe 15 minutes outside of downtown. So it's an inner ring suburb.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=66" target="_blank">00:01:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And why there, is this where you've always been? What's your favorite place in the world?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=71" target="_blank">00:01:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Not even close. No, I started in, I grew up in, I was in Philadelphia till I was 13,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=77" target="_blank">00:01:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and then I moved to Minnesota. I was there for a long time, till I was about 30.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=82" target="_blank">00:01:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I moved to Boston because of work, because of the company I was working with,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=90" target="_blank">00:01:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and then I just ended up staying here. And then I'm here because the public schools here are great,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and so I probably, all other things considered live in the city, but for the time being,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to take advantage of the public schools. Boston's a great town. I spent quite a bit of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=109" target="_blank">00:01:49.840</a></span> | <span class="t">time there when I set up an office in one of my earlier companies there, and I got very into the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Boston Red Sox, as you do, and got very into the Tennyson Racquet Club, and I have a very good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">friend. I used to be a member of Tennyson Racquet, and I have a very good friend there who's still a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=129" target="_blank">00:02:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">big place there quite a bit, so that's a gem. Yeah, that's a big town. And also, I loved it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">because I didn't know anybody. It's definitely a town where you could just go to a random bar,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">sit down, watch the game, and whoever's around you will chat. It's interesting to talk to. Yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that's true. So you end up, you're in Australia now. I am in Australia now. And you were in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Australia before. Yeah, so I'm in Queensland, which is a kind of, well, the part I'm in is kind of a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">subtropical beachside town. It's not a resort town, but it's kind of like the nearest capital</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">city is Brisbane, which is like four or five million people, and it's the nearest kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">beach town that people would go to for a weekend or something. So yeah, I always wanted to live in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Queensland. Never understood why everybody didn't want to live in Queensland, and now that I'm here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm even more convinced everybody lived in Queensland. And the university is in Queensland,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">too. Yeah, so the university's in Brisbane, so I'm a binary professor at the University of Queensland,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">which is 45 minutes from here. So when I teach there, I just drive in and do my thing, drive home.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Cool. And in between, you were in Boston and California.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so I grew up in Melbourne, which seemed like the center of the world at the time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and I never understood why people talked about Australia as being far away, because it seemed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">pretty close to me. But then, yeah, moving to San Francisco, I stayed there for 10 years for a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">previous startup called Kaggle, and suddenly realized, yeah, God, Melbourne is a very long</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">way away, physically and everything else. And I do now feel like it's a very good experience</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">for somebody who grows up away from a kind of intellectual center like that, just spend some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">time living in one, just to experience that. Yeah, for sure. And yeah, so tell me about what you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">doing now. So you're the CEO of RStudio. RStudio, which I started that about 11, I don't know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">11 or 12 years ago. And that was started off originally as just an open source</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">IDE for R. And it was just it was not actually intended as a company. It was just me and one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">other person. And we had worked on lots of development tools and programming languages</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and authoring tools and in our previous lives. And I had been involved in graduate school and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">as an undergrad in social sciences and statistical programming, social sciences. And I sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=316" target="_blank">00:05:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">originally that was what I wanted to make my career. And then I kind of got swept up into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=322" target="_blank">00:05:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">software. And so when I finished with the startup, and then I found out about R, and I said, wow,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">there's an open source statistical programming system. That's cool. I really would like to work</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=333" target="_blank">00:05:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">in open source. And it sort of, as you know, is written by statisticians for statisticians,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">which gave it a lot of things, you know, a lot of things that got right. But then some of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">software tooling part they struggled with. And so I said, well, here's I can make a contribution</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.840</a></span> | <span class="t">here. I know the tooling part. And and I'd like to see this project get used by more people. So we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=355" target="_blank">00:05:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">just started working on that on the IDE. And then so that was just a couple of us. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=361" target="_blank">00:06:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">long story short, we ended up getting to know Hadley Wickham. And he was working on what was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=367" target="_blank">00:06:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">then not the tidyverse, but the dplyr and ggplot and things. And we said, let's let's all work</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=373" target="_blank">00:06:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">together. And then that sort of begged the question of well, how, how is it that we're going to all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=377" target="_blank">00:06:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">work together and make sure everyone gets paid and everything. So he said, well, let's try to make a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">company out of this. And we did that by sort of, you know, building sort of enterprise grade,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of servers that made it easier to adopt a lot of our open source software.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=396" target="_blank">00:06:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I knew Hadley from before our studio, because of course, everybody in Australia,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">New Zealand knows each other. So yeah, I remember actually hanging out with him in in Texas. And he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=409" target="_blank">00:06:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">was in at Rice University. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. And he was already famous for his amazing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=416" target="_blank">00:06:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">contributions. And he was saying to me, you know, saying like, wow, you know, the university must</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=422" target="_blank">00:07:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">love having somebody like you there. And it's like, no, quite the opposite.

And I just like short</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=434" target="_blank">00:07:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">shit, you know, what a what a terrible thing about academia is going on here. I know. And so glad</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=441" target="_blank">00:07:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">when he found you here, you know, you found him and he found you and that worked well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=446" target="_blank">00:07:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, it has. So that's good. And then the companies has developed well. And so that's,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=452" target="_blank">00:07:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, afforded one of the projects I worked on was our markdown, which is kind of a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=459" target="_blank">00:07:39.040</a></span> | <span class="t">literate programming system for our and that actually started working on that about 10 years ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=464" target="_blank">00:07:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And, and that we had a lot of success with that. But it was like, very, it was quite narrow in a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=471" target="_blank">00:07:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">sense. And that it was like, why did you do that? You had some previous interest in literate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=476" target="_blank">00:07:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">programming. You know, honestly, I there were two things that happened. I there were a bunch of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=483" target="_blank">00:08:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I was working with a bunch of faculty who were teaching are and they were teaching,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=488" target="_blank">00:08:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">they were everybody was trying to, well, they were teaching at the time, as we've,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=491" target="_blank">00:08:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">which was this sort of latex based literate programming environment that was built into our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=496" target="_blank">00:08:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and they were doing that because they wanted to teach people that are programming and reproducible</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=500" target="_blank">00:08:20.560</a></span> | <span class="t">workflow, but that they're teaching them latex, which was really, but that's unusual already,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=505" target="_blank">00:08:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">right? Like not many people. That's unusual. Our had this thing as we've built into it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, in like 2007 or so, I mean, they were way ahead of, or even before like, so, so are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=517" target="_blank">00:08:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">always had this sort of in the community. And it was, it was actually one of the core members of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=522" target="_blank">00:08:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the art team who built this as we think so they're pushing this literate programming idea. So I kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=526" target="_blank">00:08:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">of got infected with it by exposure to that. And then at the same time, I went to use our in 2012</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=533" target="_blank">00:08:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">in England. And the, one of the people who presented was presented to a three hour seminar</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=540" target="_blank">00:09:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">on org mode and presented another system for literate programming that was more, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=547" target="_blank">00:09:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">human readable ASCII oriented. And so just to clarify for people who haven't seen it. So org</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=552" target="_blank">00:09:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">mode is an, is an E max. It's not just a mode, but it's also a file format. That's which is in many</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=558" target="_blank">00:09:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">ways a lot like Markdown. It's not at all compatible, but it's the same basic idea of text-based,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=565" target="_blank">00:09:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, format, but also in org mode, your code can kind of be evaluated and the, the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=572" target="_blank">00:09:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">executed results of the execution appear in the document. So it has a lot of like what our Markdown</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=578" target="_blank">00:09:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">is, right? It's kind of like executable code, the outputs appear. That's exactly right. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=584" target="_blank">00:09:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">so it's sort of like this idea. Well, we've got to ask, we've, it's really hard to teach people a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=587" target="_blank">00:09:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">of tech. Some people were saying, well, is there a way we could get this into office? Can we get,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=591" target="_blank">00:09:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">can we get through this with open document? How are we going to get people to do this without</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=595" target="_blank">00:09:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">while not burdening them with learning a lot of tech? When I saw org mode, I said, wow,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=599" target="_blank">00:09:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that's a better idea to me and more just ask on human readable ASCII based idea. But at the time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=606" target="_blank">00:10:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Markdown was already really taking off and it was already in use on GitHub. It was in Houston,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=611" target="_blank">00:10:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">a bunch of Wiki systems. And so I said, let's, let's take the, the core ideas of org mode and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=617" target="_blank">00:10:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">sweep and build a Markdown variant of that. And, and I did it with R because that's the,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=622" target="_blank">00:10:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that's the environment I was working in. It was just, it had sort of blinders on like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=626" target="_blank">00:10:26.720</a></span> | <span class="t">let's just make this work in the environment. And you were personally like doing stuff with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=631" target="_blank">00:10:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">literate programming yourself and it found it useful or your, I found it useful because I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=635" target="_blank">00:10:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">building websites and documents. And yeah, I, I definitely was thought this is a great way to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=640" target="_blank">00:10:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">work. And then, and at the same time, Yihue Z was created, had created a package called KnitR</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=647" target="_blank">00:10:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">that was sort of a replacement for sweep. It was sort of a better, like sort of feature enhanced</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=653" target="_blank">00:10:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">version of sweep. And at the same time he made it open so it could do restructure text and it could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=657" target="_blank">00:10:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">do any ASCII doc and it could do Markdown. And so he, Yihue and I got together and said, let's create</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=664" target="_blank">00:11:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">this thing called R Markdown, which basically says we're going to use Knitter as a computational</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=669" target="_blank">00:11:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">engine and we're going to use Markdown. At the time, it was just like, we basically use sundown,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=674" target="_blank">00:11:14.240</a></span> | <span class="t">which was GitHub's Markdown processor. And we added math, you know, so that was pretty straightforward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=680" target="_blank">00:11:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">These tools all have R in them. Are they all exclusively R tools?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=685" target="_blank">00:11:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">They, they are, they require R to run. They're pretty much R. They now, they're multi-engine,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=693" target="_blank">00:11:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">so Knitter has this idea of engine. So there is a Python engine and a Julia engine,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=697" target="_blank">00:11:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">but you're, you're calling Python from R. You have an embedded Python session in your R session. You</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=703" target="_blank">00:11:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">have an embedded Julia session in your R session. So like, it's very R-centric, even though it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=708" target="_blank">00:11:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">multiple languages, it's very R-centric. So, so yeah. And then, so we did the first iteration of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=715" target="_blank">00:11:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">it and you could just make, you could just make web pages. And then at the same time, Pandoc was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=719" target="_blank">00:11:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of evolving and people were trying to figure out, they were like, oh, let me just glue together</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=723" target="_blank">00:12:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">our Markdown with Pandoc and then I can make board documents and PDFs and so on. That's, that's going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=727" target="_blank">00:12:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to be something a lot of people are not familiar with. So Pandoc is a, basically a Markdown processor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=733" target="_blank">00:12:13.680</a></span> | <span class="t">It's, it's, I think it's written in Haskell, right? Although it's a compiled binary, so that doesn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=739" target="_blank">00:12:19.520</a></span> | <span class="t">matter for most people. And yeah, it's kind of like a pretty, I mean, it is a kind of a Markdown</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=746" target="_blank">00:12:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">processor, but it can take almost any input and convert it into its Markdown and then convert that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=750" target="_blank">00:12:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">into one of the steady app ports. Any text to any text. Yeah, it doesn't actually even convert it to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=756" target="_blank">00:12:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Markdown. It converts it to an internal format. That's a sort of abstract document. And so like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=765" target="_blank">00:12:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">if you're going Word to PDF, it's never seeing Markdown. It's just going. Yeah. So JJ, I had used</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=771" target="_blank">00:12:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Pandoc before talking to you about all this stuff, but I had used it in this very kind of naive way</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=779" target="_blank">00:12:59.600</a></span> | <span class="t">of just being like, Oh, I've got a document, you know, HTML document, and I want to convert it to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=784" target="_blank">00:13:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">LaTeX or we're going to convert LaTeX to Markdown or whatever. And I just run it. Now, what I've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=789" target="_blank">00:13:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">learned from you is that actually, you know, Pandoc has this like embedded Lua interpreter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=798" target="_blank">00:13:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and this kind of very generic system, kind of a bit like NB convert the notebook. Yeah, that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=805" target="_blank">00:13:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">right. Yeah. Takes this input as a kind of abstract syntax tree. You can munch it however</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=812" target="_blank">00:13:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">you like. You spit it back out. You can fit that anywhere in a Pandoc path to kind of construct</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=819" target="_blank">00:13:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">your own. It's like a document. It's a pipeline of transformations to the document. And the most</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=829" target="_blank">00:13:49.680</a></span> | <span class="t">obvious of which is I just want to make a PDF or I just want to make a Word document or a web page,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=834" target="_blank">00:13:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">but there's other. Yeah. And the other thing to mention is, I mean, as you said, it doesn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=838" target="_blank">00:13:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">particularly require Markdown, but you know, by the way, you know, Pandoc Markdown is this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=844" target="_blank">00:14:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">fairly universal format because you can express things like divs and classes and layouts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=850" target="_blank">00:14:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, yeah, the Markdown syntax, you can express the whole Pandoc AST in Pandoc Markdown.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=856" target="_blank">00:14:16.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So it's a kind of a Markdown on steroids. One of the ideas that, though, that was taken</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=862" target="_blank">00:14:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">really seriously by John McFarland when he created Pandoc was. So the original Markdown had the idea</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=870" target="_blank">00:14:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">of raw HTML because the idea of John Gruber's idea was like, this is just an easier way to write</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=873" target="_blank">00:14:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">HTML. So of course you can put raw HTML in there. If it's something isn't in Markdown, just go ahead</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=878" target="_blank">00:14:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and add the HTML. So that's a good idea. But what he had, and he was interested in creating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=884" target="_blank">00:14:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">technical manuscripts. So he extended that to, you can put raw LaTeX in there. And so he basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=890" target="_blank">00:14:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">said also you can have raw LaTeX. And he made it so it was very good at generating LaTeX.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=896" target="_blank">00:14:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So he sort of added this. Yeah, because there's also Pandoc citations, for example. And citations,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=901" target="_blank">00:15:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">right? So he added this idea of let's take LaTeX really seriously in a way that other Markdown</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=905" target="_blank">00:15:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">processors tend not to, because that's not really their use case. There are a lot of them are tied</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=910" target="_blank">00:15:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to like content management systems and things are producing web content. And then let's take</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=914" target="_blank">00:15:14.720</a></span> | <span class="t">citations really seriously. So they had a really robust implementation of citations and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=920" target="_blank">00:15:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">integration with citation style language. So really first class citations and support of LaTeX,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=927" target="_blank">00:15:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and then ultimately support of Office document formats and open document and things like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=932" target="_blank">00:15:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So it was a more elaborate, comprehensive, hackable version of Markdown. So when we migrated,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=942" target="_blank">00:15:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">we created sort of our Markdown v2 was based on Pandoc. And then--</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=946" target="_blank">00:15:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And how long ago was that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=948" target="_blank">00:15:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">That was a couple of years. That was about eight years ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=952" target="_blank">00:15:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Pretty early on we moved to Pandoc, maybe even nine years ago. Pretty early on we just moved to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=958" target="_blank">00:15:58.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Pandoc. And then kind of to make a long story short, we created a lot of extensions to our Markdown.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=965" target="_blank">00:16:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">We created a thing for making books, and we created a thing for making blogs, and we created</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=968" target="_blank">00:16:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">a thing for presentations, and for kind of like fancy grid layout of documents. And so we had all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=976" target="_blank">00:16:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">these-- we did a version of the Distill Machine Learning Journal from Google. If you've seen those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=981" target="_blank">00:16:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">articles, we made an our Markdown version of that. So we sort of innovated a lot in a very fragmented</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=987" target="_blank">00:16:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">way. And so we ended up at the end of this with-- we have this system that has a lot of functionality</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=994" target="_blank">00:16:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that's fractured across a bunch of packages with a bunch of inconsistency that's R only.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=998" target="_blank">00:16:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we said that is kind of a dead end in terms of having a bigger impact on scientific</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1004" target="_blank">00:16:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">computing. And so we said, if we could take a step back, build a system that was agnostic to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1010" target="_blank">00:16:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">engine, the computational engine, and at the same time try to roll up a lot and synthesize a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1017" target="_blank">00:16:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the ideas that we developed over that 10-year period into kind of one uniform system, then that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1023" target="_blank">00:17:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">would be kind of what we needed to do to really like continue investing in a way that we felt like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1027" target="_blank">00:17:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">this project is going to be meaningful in decades. So we kind of-- it was almost like take a couple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1033" target="_blank">00:17:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">steps back. And that was a couple of years ago. We said, let's start working on quarto, which is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1040" target="_blank">00:17:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">language independent engine agnostic where the first two engines supported our Nitter, which was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1046" target="_blank">00:17:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">what we supported in our Markdown and Jupyter. And so those are sort of equal citizens. And it is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1052" target="_blank">00:17:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">possible to-- Let me just get that up. So yeah. OK, so here's quarto. OK, so this is what you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1062" target="_blank">00:17:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">working on. That's what I'm working on now. So that's pretty much what I've been working on for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1066" target="_blank">00:17:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">directly or indirectly for about the last three years. And this looks a lot like Markdown.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1077" target="_blank">00:17:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">It does. Yeah. It is derivative. It's syntax. And an approach to things is derivative of our Markdown.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1085" target="_blank">00:18:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you've got some YAML front metas, so some metadata, which is supported by Pandoc, I believe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1092" target="_blank">00:18:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Then you've got some Markdown. This looks like something that's not in any Markdown I'm familiar</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1101" target="_blank">00:18:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">with. That's right. That's a cross-reference. OK. So it's saying I want a reference--</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1108" target="_blank">00:18:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Here is the label. And so now we've got, as a result, the Markdown here, the metadata here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1117" target="_blank">00:18:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">The code is also folding. And I guess I can't click on this picture if I could. And a hyperlink.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1127" target="_blank">00:18:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">This was all the cross-reference. It's numbered the figure. It's only figure one. But if there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1132" target="_blank">00:18:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">were 17 figures, you'd see one, two, three, four, et cetera. So that's kind of the idea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1137" target="_blank">00:18:57.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Had interactive documents as well. Yep. Yep. So we do integration with Observable and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1144" target="_blank">00:19:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Jupyter. So really with Jupyter, we put the most effort into Python and making everything work</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1152" target="_blank">00:19:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">great in Python. We've put some effort into Julia. Any Jupyter kernel works with it. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1159" target="_blank">00:19:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">if we do a little extra work, then it works better. So yeah. So I mean, seriously, anything works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1168" target="_blank">00:19:28.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I've been recently playing with APL. And I created the first ever APL kernel. Nice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1180" target="_blank">00:19:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And so here's links to APL cliff documentation. Yep. Here is auto-generated table of contents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1193" target="_blank">00:19:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">That's cool. And then here's a Python one. Yeah. So yeah. So that's what I've been working on. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1209" target="_blank">00:20:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I know the way that you and I got connected, well, we got introduced separately. Just hey,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1215" target="_blank">00:20:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">you should get to know each other. And then we got to talking about. Yeah, that's right. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1221" target="_blank">00:20:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">author of advances and error and such luck. Yes. Yeah. So Wes introduced us and it was like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1230" target="_blank">00:20:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">what are you working on? What are you working on? And we just, you talked a little bit about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1234" target="_blank">00:20:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">nbdev2 and literate programming. And I said, well, this cordos might be related to what you're doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1240" target="_blank">00:20:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But it might be. I mean, I already knew, very much knew you by reputation, because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1248" target="_blank">00:20:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I was not a big user of ColdFusion, but I was an enthusiast of it, which I can come back to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1257" target="_blank">00:20:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and talk about that. I was a big user of Windows Live Writer. So these are both things that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1261" target="_blank">00:21:01.600</a></span> | <span class="t">would build. And Windows Live Writer was something which felt like, it reminded me of the original</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1267" target="_blank">00:21:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Mac OS graph calculator. It felt like better than all of the other things, like, because it came from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1273" target="_blank">00:21:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Microsoft, it felt better than all the other things that were around it somehow. And I thought, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1277" target="_blank">00:21:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">how did something so come up in the windows, what I call windows extras or whatever it was, windows</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1285" target="_blank">00:21:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">plus windows. Well, yeah, there was like, anyway. Yeah. So yeah. And then I remember it at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1295" target="_blank">00:21:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">University of San Francisco, one of our admin staff said, Oh, there's a, just got this request from a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1303" target="_blank">00:21:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">guy from, you know, who's thinking of flying in for the lessons. You know, you might want to get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1311" target="_blank">00:21:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">in touch with him to see if that's suitable. And it's like, what's his name? It's like it's a guy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1314" target="_blank">00:21:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">called JJ Allaire. And I was like, oh, JJ Allaire is interested in fast AI. That's really cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1319" target="_blank">00:21:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, the reason I was going to do that was I was working on, I was working, creating an R interface</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1327" target="_blank">00:22:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">for Keras. And so I had done, we had done R, I created the R interface to Python, which is called</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1333" target="_blank">00:22:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Reticulate. And then we built the TensorFlow interface. And then I was building the Keras</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1337" target="_blank">00:22:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">interface. And I said, well, I'm going to go take Jeremy's course in Keras. And then I found out,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1342" target="_blank">00:22:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">wait, it's not in Keras anymore. Right? It's yeah. And I said, okay, I would still like to take the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1349" target="_blank">00:22:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">course, but it's less right down the middle of what I'm doing. So I didn't do it. But I actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1354" target="_blank">00:22:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">had convinced one other person to do it with me. Although you did tell me that some fast ideas</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1359" target="_blank">00:22:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">did end up in some of your. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So so yeah, so studying fast AI is we, especially as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1365" target="_blank">00:22:45.520</a></span> | <span class="t">we did our PyTorch work. And we, because as you know, PyTorch doesn't doesn't offer you much in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1371" target="_blank">00:22:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the way of like a built in training loop. Right. And it doesn't really organize your work. No, it's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1376" target="_blank">00:22:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Keras does. Right. And I think we rather liked the things you did in fast AI. And so we said, let's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1383" target="_blank">00:23:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">can we do can we do some variations of those, you know, for our interface, because we clearly it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1388" target="_blank">00:23:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">wasn't enough to just say, Oh, you can use torch from our I mean, it's for some certain researchers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1393" target="_blank">00:23:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">it's fine, but not for end users. So yeah, I mean, I try to encourage even researchers not to just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1400" target="_blank">00:23:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">use raw PyTorch for everything. Because, you know, you really want to be incorporating best practices</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1407" target="_blank">00:23:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">as much as you can. Not I didn't have a couple since we're on fast AI, I did have a couple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1414" target="_blank">00:23:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">questions. And one of them is like, if you think about how you help both new users ramp into things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1427" target="_blank">00:23:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and make experienced users productive, right, you provide these abstractions.

So for example, the high level, so there's three main levels of API at fast AI,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1553" target="_blank">00:25:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the high level mid tier low level, the high level API is focused on applications. We provide support</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1560" target="_blank">00:26:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">for for which is vision, text, tabular and collaborative filtering. And then there are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1566" target="_blank">00:26:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">other folks in the community who have added stuff around, you know, medical and audio and whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1572" target="_blank">00:26:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And in each case, you basically use the same four lines of code. Okay, that kind of just like push</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1577" target="_blank">00:26:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">button interface, if you yeah, like, and that was the recipe. Yeah, and that was very much designed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1582" target="_blank">00:26:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">about the idea that one day, we want to get rid of the code, and there'll be a higher level API</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1587" target="_blank">00:26:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">still, which is not good. Yeah, yeah, this is what I wanted to ask you. Well, when you finish,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1592" target="_blank">00:26:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to follow up question. Okay, cool. The this is really important for stuff like deep learning,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1601" target="_blank">00:26:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">because the more boilerplate you have, the more things there are that you can screw up,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1606" target="_blank">00:26:46.560</a></span> | <span class="t">you know. And so if you have to like, manually create your validation set manually, make sure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1612" target="_blank">00:26:52.560</a></span> | <span class="t">it's not shuffled, and manually make sure the training set is shuffled, and manually make sure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1617" target="_blank">00:26:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">that the augmentation is only applied to the training, like, each of those is something that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1621" target="_blank">00:27:01.520</a></span> | <span class="t">you're reasonably likely to forget. And when things break in deep learning, they don't break</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1628" target="_blank">00:27:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">properly. Generally, they don't give you an exception, or a sec fault, they just give you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1632" target="_blank">00:27:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">slightly less good answers, or it's leading or misleading metrics. Yeah. So, so then the mid tier</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1641" target="_blank">00:27:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">API is the bit I'm most proud of. And I find that's often the hardest bit to write, you want something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1648" target="_blank">00:27:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that's extremely flexible, and that you almost never have to go deeper, but still really convenient.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1655" target="_blank">00:27:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And so for example, we've got a thing called the data blocks API, which came from me, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1661" target="_blank">00:27:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I've been doing machine learning for, let's see, over 30 years now. And, you know, I just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1668" target="_blank">00:27:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">thought back to like, well, what are all, what's the entire set of things I've had to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1673" target="_blank">00:27:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">to get data into a model training. And I, you know, realized that there was just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1681" target="_blank">00:28:01.200</a></span> | <span class="t">okay, there's like four basic, four or five basic things. Yeah. And I realized that when I pulled</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1687" target="_blank">00:28:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">out those four or five basic things, the huge number of classes I used to have before I built</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1693" target="_blank">00:28:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the data blocks API, I realized I could replace them with just these five things by putting the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1700" target="_blank">00:28:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">blocks together. And so I was able to reduce the amount of code I had by 10 fold, and increase the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1708" target="_blank">00:28:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">ability for me to write my high level API a lot, and then to give the same thing to all my users.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1715" target="_blank">00:28:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, yeah, the bottom level API, it's still above PyTorch. Well, it's mainly like filling in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1722" target="_blank">00:28:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the things that aren't in PyTorch, but should be. So for example, I like using some object oriented</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1728" target="_blank">00:28:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">programming. And I believe that types should represent where possible semantic things. That's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1734" target="_blank">00:28:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">something which that doesn't really exist in PyTorch. So I added object oriented types,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1742" target="_blank">00:29:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">semantic types to PyTorch. Something that they've added, it's still not amazing. But we created</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1749" target="_blank">00:29:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">first is like a computer vision library that entirely operates on the GPU and does things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1754" target="_blank">00:29:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">in a really efficient way. So kind of stuff like that. So then the idea is that a user,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1762" target="_blank">00:29:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">we want them, if they're doing something supported by our application API, we want them to be able</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1768" target="_blank">00:29:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to use it. We want them then to be able to say like, okay, that worked okay, but I wonder what if,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1772" target="_blank">00:29:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, could I make it faster by doing this? Or make it more accurate by doing that? And they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1777" target="_blank">00:29:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">can just pull out one piece and replace it with a mid tier API thing, you know? So rather than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1784" target="_blank">00:29:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">starting at the bottom, and then adding, you know, simplifying things with a high tier, start at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1790" target="_blank">00:29:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">top, which is also how we teach, you know, and then add in lower level things if and as you need them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1797" target="_blank">00:29:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Did you have a goal, like, kind of what I'm thinking about, like for leaky abstraction,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1801" target="_blank">00:30:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">do you have a goal where it's like, well, if someone has found, and I have not personally used</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1808" target="_blank">00:30:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">PyTorch, but I use Keras quite a bit, if someone finds the equivalent of a layer, you know, someone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1812" target="_blank">00:30:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">has written a layer for PyTorch, they find it on Stack Overflow, how do I, you know, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1817" target="_blank">00:30:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">reduce the error here, whatever.

You need to put that in a frame that the vast AI can consume. Yeah, so everything, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1837" target="_blank">00:30:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the idea is basically that everything should be very easy for you to grab stuff from elsewhere and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1845" target="_blank">00:30:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">just use it. So we actually have, you know, so we've got a bunch of integration, for example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1851" target="_blank">00:30:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">but in particular, you know, there's like, okay, what if, yeah, that's a great virtue of a system,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1860" target="_blank">00:31:00.160</a></span> | <span class="t">if it can do that, yeah, then it then it doesn't suffer from the we have to do everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1865" target="_blank">00:31:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Exactly. Special packaging, special wrappers. So what I did was I grabbed for this one,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1873" target="_blank">00:31:13.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I actually grabbed the MNIST training code from the official PyTorch examples.

So I took their code. And then I said, okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1899" target="_blank">00:31:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">well, how could, what if we wanted to replace their training loop and test loop? That's a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1907" target="_blank">00:31:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">of code, right?

So for example, the PyTorch data loaders are things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1979" target="_blank">00:32:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">which take things that are either indexable or streamable one item at a time and batch them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1986" target="_blank">00:33:06.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And we created something with the same name. The fastai.data.data loader. And then we added stuff</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1993" target="_blank">00:33:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">to it. We said, oh, we had a bunch of callback hooks that you can modify the data, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=1999" target="_blank">00:33:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">after it's been batched or after it's been turned into an item or whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2003" target="_blank">00:33:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So when I was thinking about your application layer, because I know like in your course,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2009" target="_blank">00:33:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">you say you need to, you know, high school mathematics and some programming is what you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2015" target="_blank">00:33:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">need to be able to learn this. And my question is, you could imagine, and I don't even know if this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2022" target="_blank">00:33:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">is a good or a bad thing. So it's more just a question. You can imagine, you know, as you said</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2027" target="_blank">00:33:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">earlier, an application that does transfer learning and, you know, takes various types of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2032" target="_blank">00:33:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">data that's well known and lets people say, oh, I'm doing computer vision. Or is that the right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2037" target="_blank">00:33:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">layer or not? Right. Do you think that's a desirable layer to have or is the are you at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2043" target="_blank">00:34:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the right layer now where the person will encounter enough complexity that they really best know some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2049" target="_blank">00:34:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">math and know some program? Yeah. So you can see where it would not be desirable to go further.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2054" target="_blank">00:34:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So the answer is so far, we've we failed at our goal to make deep learning accessible</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2066" target="_blank">00:34:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">because we require high school math and a year of coding. And that's not accessible because most</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2072" target="_blank">00:34:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">people like I think only 1% of the world has like that coding background. So the goal has always</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2080" target="_blank">00:34:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">been to get to a point where I use the analogy to the internet, right? So when I started on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2088" target="_blank">00:34:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">internet, you would have to do it all through the terminal. And even when the first GUI things came</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2094" target="_blank">00:34:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">in, you would have to set up like PPP configuration files, whatever. And, you know, I'd read NewsNet</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2101" target="_blank">00:35:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">News with RN, which, you know, with all these arcane keyboard shortcuts, I mean, I loved it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2107" target="_blank">00:35:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">But it wasn't the most accessible thing. Nowadays, you know, my mum, who's 83, uses the internet</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2113" target="_blank">00:35:13.680</a></span> | <span class="t">every day to chat to her six year old daughter on Skype and whatever. That's what most, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2122" target="_blank">00:35:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">AI should look like. Okay. We're starting to see a bit of that with things like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2128" target="_blank">00:35:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Codex and DALI Mini and DALI 2 and Mid-Journey and whatever, GPT-3, where, you know, I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2138" target="_blank">00:35:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">know if you saw it yesterday, a book on OpenAI Prompt Engineering came out. In fact, I'm gonna</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2146" target="_blank">00:35:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">see if I can find it because it's quite interesting. And so basically, it's like there's still skill</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2152" target="_blank">00:35:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">involved in trying to create beautiful and relevant images using DALI 2. But it's not coding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2164" target="_blank">00:36:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a different skill. It's Prompt Engineering. And okay, I think I found it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2176" target="_blank">00:36:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So let me share my screen here. And I like this because we're all about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2183" target="_blank">00:36:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">domain experts, you know. And so, you know, here's a whole book about how to create nice</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2195" target="_blank">00:36:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">pictures with DALI. And it doesn't have with lots of examples of nice pictures from DALI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2200" target="_blank">00:36:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's no code in it, right? It's saying like, oh, we've done some research to find out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2207" target="_blank">00:36:47.520</a></span> | <span class="t">what kinds of words create what kinds of pictures. Here's examples of that for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2212" target="_blank">00:36:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's like someone learns, essentially, here you learn a craft of how to see the right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2218" target="_blank">00:36:58.720</a></span> | <span class="t">sorts of things. It's totally different than programming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2222" target="_blank">00:37:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. And it requires like a genuine understanding of domain. So if you want to create good camera</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2228" target="_blank">00:37:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">shots that don't exist, you have to know about words like "experience close up" and "sinisterial</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2234" target="_blank">00:37:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">800T". Yeah, well, you can become very, very good at this. You know, extreme long shot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2239" target="_blank">00:37:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And even like describing shadows and proportions. This is the kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2249" target="_blank">00:37:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">thing we want people to be spending most of their time doing. And also the kind of people I want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2256" target="_blank">00:37:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">be doing it are domain experts in that field. So we want, you know, product marketing people,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2265" target="_blank">00:37:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, product photography people using their product photography skills to create</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2270" target="_blank">00:37:50.560</a></span> | <span class="t">product photography mockups. We want disaster resilience experts to be doing disaster</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2275" target="_blank">00:37:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">resilience. We want radiologists doing radiology, supported by AI, you know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2281" target="_blank">00:38:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. So yeah, so the tool that you would build for a radiologist, I mean, in a way,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2288" target="_blank">00:38:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you could even have it, you can imagine a radiologist is training a model, basically,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2292" target="_blank">00:38:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">in a way, they're doing transfer learning, they're applying their data, they're there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2297" target="_blank">00:38:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. But it's in their DICOM viewer, you know, on their radiology workflow software.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2308" target="_blank">00:38:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. Well, I think the answer is that you would like to go quite a bit farther than you have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2314" target="_blank">00:38:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Right with that. I don't quite remember what we said at the time we started. So when my wife,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2318" target="_blank">00:38:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Rachel, and I started fast AI, we just I think we were thinking it's at least a 10 year goal,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2325" target="_blank">00:38:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and of making deep learning more accessible. And like our first step was, well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2331" target="_blank">00:38:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">we should at least show people how to use what already exists. So that's why we started with a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2337" target="_blank">00:38:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">course. That was the first thing we built. Because also, that way, we would find out well, what,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2344" target="_blank">00:39:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">what doesn't exist, but ought to, you know, and so then it was like, well, basically, nothing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2351" target="_blank">00:39:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">works except vision, computer vision at the moment, we should at least make sure this works</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2356" target="_blank">00:39:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">for text. So step two was, I did a lot of research into text, and I built the ULM fit algorithm and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2364" target="_blank">00:39:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">integrated that and, you know, so there's a lot of research to do. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2368" target="_blank">00:39:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">then it was like, okay, well, from the research we've done, we've realized that there's a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2376" target="_blank">00:39:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">things that you could do a lot better if only the software existed. So then step three was to make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2379" target="_blank">00:39:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">the software exist, you know, so then there was a lot of coding. And then, you know, come back full</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2385" target="_blank">00:39:45.520</a></span> | <span class="t">circle, do another course, you know, now showing here the best practices using everything we've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2392" target="_blank">00:39:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">learned and built. Where are we now, you know, and so repeat this. So we've, we're just about to launch</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2400" target="_blank">00:40:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">version five of this, of this process, which, except for a year off, for COVID has been an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2408" target="_blank">00:40:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">annual exercise. Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if in the next five years, we have quite a bit of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2417" target="_blank">00:40:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the like code free stuff that we're aiming for. Okay. Yeah. Okay. All right. All right. My turn,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2424" target="_blank">00:40:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">if I may. Okay, go for it. You got it. I wanted to change track a little bit, if I can,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2429" target="_blank">00:40:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to talk about your background, JJ.

So one was how I got interested in data analysis, and statistical computing was, I was a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2544" target="_blank">00:42:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">huge baseball fan. And I when I was like 12, I got a hold of books by Bill James, who you probably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2552" target="_blank">00:42:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">have heard of. And he was a he was a math teacher from Kansas City, who wrote the Bill James baseball</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2559" target="_blank">00:42:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">abstract that essentially created this idea, why don't we empirically measure everything we can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2564" target="_blank">00:42:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">about baseball and see what, see what's true and not true. And I don't know any other sport that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2571" target="_blank">00:42:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">has a whole field of academic study of statistics named, you know, sabermetrics, you know, based on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2578" target="_blank">00:42:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that. And he started all that anyway, but what was impactful for me was, I was also very interested</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2584" target="_blank">00:43:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">in politics, my parents were political activists, and I was mostly interested in politics, I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2589" target="_blank">00:43:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">interested in baseball, I got the Bill James memo. And I realized like everything that people said on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2594" target="_blank">00:43:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">television, about what was true about baseball, not everything, but a lot of the stuff was just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2599" target="_blank">00:43:19.360</a></span> | <span class="t">nonsense. The coaches, players and broadcasters, nonsense. So that had a big impact on me. I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2605" target="_blank">00:43:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">like, well, if that's true, then then a lot of the things people say about a lot of things are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2609" target="_blank">00:43:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">probably nonsense. And probably data analysis is actually really fundamentally important. And so I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2615" target="_blank">00:43:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of got then when I was looking at political science, that was my lens. I was actually happened</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2621" target="_blank">00:43:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to, I happened to find a great mentor in college who was also really into it. Can I just mention,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2627" target="_blank">00:43:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I had a similar background, but for a totally different reason, which is I started at a big</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2632" target="_blank">00:43:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">management consulting company when I was basically 10 years younger than everybody else. And they all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2638" target="_blank">00:43:58.240</a></span> | <span class="t">worked using their expertise and experience, which I didn't have. So my view was like, oh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2644" target="_blank">00:44:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to have to use data analysis because of the ways I can. Yeah, so, so I was anyway,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2651" target="_blank">00:44:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">political science, and I actually was convinced I wanted to be a political scientist, focused on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2657" target="_blank">00:44:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">data analysis and things. And so I basically went to graduate school and to get a PhD in political</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2663" target="_blank">00:44:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">science. And by that time, I actually had taken a year off and I'd worked at the Minnesota Department</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2668" target="_blank">00:44:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">of Revenue as an analyst. And I used a lot. I had done plenty of messing around with software. I had</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2675" target="_blank">00:44:35.920</a></span> | <span class="t">learned, you know, D-base and hypercard and, you know, various other kind of, you know, scripty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2681" target="_blank">00:44:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">things that a layperson could access. I wasn't, I had no training in computer science and I didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2686" target="_blank">00:44:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">take computer science in college, but I was able to get my head around things like hyper talk and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2691" target="_blank">00:44:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">D-base and things like that. So, yeah. And so then, yeah, and SAS and, you know, all these kind of,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2697" target="_blank">00:44:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I was so exposed. I remember re-reading you were doing stuff with SAS and SPSS, you know, which are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2702" target="_blank">00:45:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">some things I worked through. Yeah, SPSS, you know, Excel macros. So I ended up at the Department of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2706" target="_blank">00:45:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Revenue.

Very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2711" target="_blank">00:45:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">pragmatic. QuattroPro, you know, all this. So, and so then I got to graduate school and I just found</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2718" target="_blank">00:45:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">like, wow, I just really care a lot more about software right now than I do about political</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2724" target="_blank">00:45:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">science. It was actually at that moment when it was 90, uh, 92, 93, uh, when, when it was,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2734" target="_blank">00:45:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">software was really coming into its own.

I did, because my mentor,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2752" target="_blank">00:45:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">oh my God, I spent four years, five, I spent so much time with my mentor and, you know, I just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2758" target="_blank">00:45:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">was like, wow, this is, I know what I'm supposed to be doing and this is not what I'm supposed to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2762" target="_blank">00:46:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">doing. Right. But I really just went with the evidence of like, when I go to the bookstore,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2768" target="_blank">00:46:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I spent all my time in the computing section and that lights me up and that's what I want to talk</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2772" target="_blank">00:46:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">about.

Well, I also had a negative, a negative</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2779" target="_blank">00:46:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">experience with, um, academia, even though I had, I had a couple great professors, um, it, it didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2786" target="_blank">00:46:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">feel like I was going to, you know, um, I didn't feel like I was going to succeed. Even if I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2792" target="_blank">00:46:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">into that, I didn't feel, it didn't resonate when I got there. Um, and so I was like, well, I'm not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2797" target="_blank">00:46:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">going to do this and I think I want to do that. So I'm going to go try it. So I basically went off</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2801" target="_blank">00:46:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and said, I'm going to, you know, I'm not trained to, to write software. I need to learn a bunch of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2805" target="_blank">00:46:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">stuff. Uh, and I went and started, you know, teaching myself a bunch of stuff I needed to know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2810" target="_blank">00:46:50.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I eventually got bootstrapped into doing some contracting. Um, and then I, so I sort of was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2816" target="_blank">00:46:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">a contractor and kept learning stuff. And then I kind of by happenstance and good fortune ran into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2822" target="_blank">00:47:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the internet. Uh, and I had actually worked with my brother on. So when was that roughly? That was in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2829" target="_blank">00:47:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">90. Um, well, we got, we got the internet at, at college my senior year. So that would have been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2834" target="_blank">00:47:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">91. So we had, um, and then the web was 93. And, um, my brother was really into the internet and he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2844" target="_blank">00:47:24.720</a></span> | <span class="t">was going around the twin cities. You know, he got city pages, which is the, the news public,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2850" target="_blank">00:47:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the look, you know, the, um, the city newspaper, he got them to say, we're going to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2855" target="_blank">00:47:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">classifieds and forum, and we're going to do all this stuff on the internet. And then I,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2860" target="_blank">00:47:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and he was like, my brother doesn't write code. So he's like, Hey, JJ, you're, you're a contractor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2865" target="_blank">00:47:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">What are you, what can we do this? I was like, sure. I can figure this out. So I did that. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2870" target="_blank">00:47:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">then I was just like, and I, that the other thing that the big thing that happened for me was that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2874" target="_blank">00:47:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I was a fan of these tools that let ordinary people program. I was a fan of debase and hyper</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2880" target="_blank">00:48:00.160</a></span> | <span class="t">talking on spreadsheets. And so I was like, that's really empowering. And so when I, what happened</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2884" target="_blank">00:48:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">was I said, wow, you know, um, my brother just told me he's going to learn Pearl so he can write</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2889" target="_blank">00:48:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">websites. Yeah. And I'm, and I'm looking at what, and I'm looking at what I did. I let pills so I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2895" target="_blank">00:48:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">could write websites. I'm shoveling data in and out of a database and putting it through like a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2899" target="_blank">00:48:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">template, you know, and mapping form fields to database. Like this is not, we don't need Pearl</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2905" target="_blank">00:48:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">here. You know, I mean, it turns out to do, to do fancy stuff, you need the equivalent of Pearl,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2910" target="_blank">00:48:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but to do the most basic things you don't. And so that's what I kind of came up and I,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2914" target="_blank">00:48:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and I always, I loved the idea of tools and abstractions and making computing accessible</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2919" target="_blank">00:48:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and programming accessible. You know, I think the first one of those tools for the web was,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2923" target="_blank">00:48:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">was Australian.

It was.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2928" target="_blank">00:48:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So somebody, yeah. So I, I did. I, I kind of said, well, I'm going to take a shot at,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2934" target="_blank">00:48:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">at making a tool and see what happens. And that was called fusion. So, um, and so, and that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2939" target="_blank">00:48:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I would say the other, so here it is called fusion. It still exists. It's still, uh, it's still, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2946" target="_blank">00:49:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that's kind of Adobe now developer week happening and looks like now. So what, um, yeah, what year</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2953" target="_blank">00:49:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">was the first version of this?

It was concurrent with front page.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2986" target="_blank">00:49:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And front page didn't really do this front pages. No, it didn't. Yeah. So it was, it was concurrent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2991" target="_blank">00:49:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">with front page. And basically the, the two of the biggest differentiators were, um, we had her</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=2997" target="_blank">00:49:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">basically really good documentation and really good error messages, you know? And we just,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3002" target="_blank">00:50:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, we'd see competitors that had twice our feature set, get no adoption. And what language</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3007" target="_blank">00:50:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">did you write this first? Okay. So I mean, but I don't remember a point at which you said you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3014" target="_blank">00:50:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">learned C plus plus when I left graduate school, I learned C plus plus. Yeah. It took a couple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3021" target="_blank">00:50:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">of years and, and I did the, the city pages, you know, project, and then this was my first serious</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3027" target="_blank">00:50:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">project. And now I wouldn't say I was good at it at that time, but I was certainly enough to, to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3032" target="_blank">00:50:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">ship something. So, um, yeah. So, um, so yeah, so that was that. And, um, that was a great experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3040" target="_blank">00:50:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And I learned a ton from that. I also learned that, as you were saying, you know, I, I didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3045" target="_blank">00:50:45.840</a></span> | <span class="t">particularly relish the parts of entrepreneurship that didn't involve product development, you know?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3051" target="_blank">00:50:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, and there are a lot of those are really important things that need to happen.

Now I think about it. That's right. Yeah, he's in Boston. Yeah. I, I, I met him once</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3149" target="_blank">00:52:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and happy and I met him once.

Just watch those two of them talk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3156" target="_blank">00:52:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. I should let you have a go at a question. Yes. Well, I was, I wanted to get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3162" target="_blank">00:52:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">into a little bit of getting back to nbdev2. Oh, please. So maybe just to orient the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3169" target="_blank">00:52:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">listeners who haven't seen nbdev or nbdev2. I mean, I, you've taken the, you know, notebooks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3176" target="_blank">00:52:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">further than anyone thought possible and have created something really, really incredible. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3182" target="_blank">00:53:02.560</a></span> | <span class="t">so I would love to hear, or I think other folks would love to try to hear general framing of what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3186" target="_blank">00:53:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that is. And I have some follow-up questions about it. Yeah, sure. So, I mean, one of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3193" target="_blank">00:53:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">best things I received was when the original creator of Jupyter and IPython notebooks sent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3203" target="_blank">00:53:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">me an email and sent this blog post. He's printed out and put on his wall and he shows it to everybody</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3213" target="_blank">00:53:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">who wants to understand what, you know, notebooks are meant to be all about. And basically,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3224" target="_blank">00:53:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I really enjoy writing code in notebooks. And this is what, this is what my notebooks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3235" target="_blank">00:53:55.440</a></span> | <span class="t">look like. So this is a bit better here, but this is the first few cells of the first notebook,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3242" target="_blank">00:54:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">which is used to generate nbdev. And when I first started, I didn't know anything about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3248" target="_blank">00:54:08.560</a></span> | <span class="t">notebooks internal. So I had to figure out what is a notebook. And so I wrote this thing that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3253" target="_blank">00:54:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">reads a notebook, and then I look inside it. And as I do that, I'm a huge fan of the scientific</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3263" target="_blank">00:54:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">idea of journaling, right? Most of the world's best scientists have been very thoughtful about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3270" target="_blank">00:54:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">how they journal, you know. So for example, the discovery of the noble gases, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3276" target="_blank">00:54:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">was something where basically, you know, this left over little bit of residue because the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3282" target="_blank">00:54:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">scientists have been so careful about the process and journaling the path, they recognize that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3287" target="_blank">00:54:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">shouldn't be there. You know, it's not I made a mistake, throw it away, but it's like, let's look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3291" target="_blank">00:54:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">into it. Like, it helps with a rigor and knowing what's going on. So I like to document what I do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3298" target="_blank">00:54:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">as I do it. And I also know that at some point, I'm going to want to share this with somebody else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3303" target="_blank">00:55:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to show them what I found out. And I got to forget this in a year. So I want to forget</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3308" target="_blank">00:55:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Germany here when I found out. But then I don't want that to be a separate artifact somewhere else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3316" target="_blank">00:55:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, as I go along, I'm writing little functions, right? So initially, these two lines of code</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3322" target="_blank">00:55:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">would have been in their own cell, that that would have been, oh, okay, that's how you open a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3325" target="_blank">00:55:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">notebook. Let's make it a function. And so I can chuck a def on top and give it. And you're also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3331" target="_blank">00:55:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">articulating your understanding. Yeah, exactly. And then it's like, oh, I think it ought to give</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3338" target="_blank">00:55:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">something like this. And I check and it's like, oh, I did give that. And so now I've got a test of my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3343" target="_blank">00:55:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">understanding and the API. And I've got to check that it's going to be consistent. And so that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3347" target="_blank">00:55:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">becomes a test. So let's actually have a look at this. So here is the notebook which creates</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3359" target="_blank">00:55:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">notebooks, which creates nbdev. So here's notebook number one. And so we can then look at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3368" target="_blank">00:56:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">documentation for nbdev. Because writing documentation, like most people don't really do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3378" target="_blank">00:56:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, yeah. Well, that's what I was saying, that the whole reason that Coldview succeeds is because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3382" target="_blank">00:56:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">we wrote documents. Right. So you'll see that my documentation here is the same thing as the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3388" target="_blank">00:56:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">source code. And that's because source code and documentation and tests, they're all in the same</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3397" target="_blank">00:56:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">place. And this is like, this is kind of in some ways a lot more than just literate programming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3408" target="_blank">00:56:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's what I call exploratory programming. And it's this idea of like trying to recognize that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3415" target="_blank">00:56:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">programming is a process done by humans and that we can support humans doing that process by giving</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3423" target="_blank">00:57:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">them tools that fit that process. So that's really what nbdev is all about. And it's not a new idea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3432" target="_blank">00:57:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So obviously Knuth was the guy who kind of created the idea of literate programming,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3440" target="_blank">00:57:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">combining programming language with the documentation language. And these ideas that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3446" target="_blank">00:57:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">programs should be more robust, more portable, more easily maintained, and also more fun to write.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3451" target="_blank">00:57:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">All things I found to be true. When I'm writing code like this, I tend to be in the flow zone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3461" target="_blank">00:57:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">all the time. Because every line of code that ends up in a function, I've run it independently,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3468" target="_blank">00:57:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I've explored it, and I've played with it. I know how it works. So I don't have many bugs. And if I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3475" target="_blank">00:57:55.440</a></span> | <span class="t">do, they're ever weird bugs I don't understand. So I'm always progressing. So then Brett Victor,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3485" target="_blank">00:58:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">who I really admire, talked about a programming system for understanding programs. And he has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3495" target="_blank">00:58:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">some amazing examples of what could programming look like in a way that's much more exploratory</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3502" target="_blank">00:58:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and playful. And so then another thing which was fantastic, my friend Chris Latner built Xcode</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3512" target="_blank">00:58:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Playgrounds, which again, it kind of lets you see what's going on, you know, how many times it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3518" target="_blank">00:58:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">going through the loop, and what does it look like. So there was a lot of like, and of course,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3523" target="_blank">00:58:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">small talk, you know, small talk was explicitly designed for exploration, like, it's, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3528" target="_blank">00:58:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">you have this whole... I was going to mention small talk in my file question. So that's great. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3532" target="_blank">00:58:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So there was all that going on. And then perhaps most relevant Mathematica, which really developed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3541" target="_blank">00:59:01.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the idea of the notebook, and I really always enjoyed working in Mathematica. But never enjoyed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3549" target="_blank">00:59:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">not being able to do anything with it, because there just wasn't a great way to like, take a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3554" target="_blank">00:59:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Mathematica notebook and give it to somebody else to play with. Yeah. Yeah. So when Jupiter came out,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3560" target="_blank">00:59:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I felt like, oh, this is a good opportunity to take these good ideas and turn them into the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3568" target="_blank">00:59:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">thing I've always wanted, which is a way to build real software, real documentation, real tests,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3572" target="_blank">00:59:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">but in this exploratory way. So that's what nbdev is. So you write your software in notebooks,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3580" target="_blank">00:59:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and you basically, you know, run a cell or a CLI command, and it exports it to a module. And that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3590" target="_blank">00:59:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">module in Python, and that module automatically ends up on PyPy. So you can pip install it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3597" target="_blank">00:59:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">you can condor install it, automatically gets the documentation website, automatically gets</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3602" target="_blank">01:00:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">continuous integration tests. So somebody who actually just tried using this the first time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3608" target="_blank">01:00:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">a couple of days ago, told me from zero to having a website and module and continuous integration</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3617" target="_blank">01:00:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">done, it was 10 minutes. Yeah, I believe it. And that's what you want, right? Because it's like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3622" target="_blank">01:00:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, you want to be to say like, oh, I brought you a little tool. Here it is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3626" target="_blank">01:00:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">There's the website, you know. And then when I get like, pull requests, you know, they're generally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3632" target="_blank">01:00:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">good, because they wrote them in the notebook. So they can see exactly what it's meant to be doing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3639" target="_blank">01:00:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">they can see the tests there, there's like, they don't forget to write tests, because they're in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3643" target="_blank">01:00:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">the same place, they don't forget to write documentation is in the same place, they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3647" target="_blank">01:00:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">understand the context of what it's about. So I also find it helps, you know, with open source</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3655" target="_blank">01:00:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">collaboration as well. Now, I will say the tooling we built it on top of, which is largely kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3664" target="_blank">01:01:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">nb-convert and stuff, the kind of the surrounding toolset around notebooks, I was never fond of.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3671" target="_blank">01:01:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I found it a bit slow and a bit clunky. I'm very grateful that open source volunteers built that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3678" target="_blank">01:01:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">stuff, but I didn't particularly like it. So then, when I came across quarter, well, the first thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3687" target="_blank">01:01:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I noticed was like, oh, this looks like nb-dev, like you guys are actually using cell comments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3694" target="_blank">01:01:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Which we got from which we took from you from fantastic. Because we were struggling with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3704" target="_blank">01:01:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">attaching metadata to cells. And as you know, notebook editors have a facility for that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3709" target="_blank">01:01:49.760</a></span> | <span class="t">that is hard to find and requires you to edit raw JSON. So he said, well, that's not good. And so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3716" target="_blank">01:01:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">he said, and I saw you do that. And I was like, because people are using tags, they're also using</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3720" target="_blank">01:02:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">tags. Absolutely. You know, and I was like, well, even the tag interface is really clumsy. And so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3725" target="_blank">01:02:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I was just like, why not the comment? You know, I saw you. Exactly. But you guys do it better,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3730" target="_blank">01:02:10.080</a></span> | <span class="t">because I saw yours and yours were like comment followed by a pipeline. And I had always kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3735" target="_blank">01:02:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">struggled with his idea of like, how does anybody know whether something in nb-dev is a comment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3740" target="_blank">01:02:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">or a directive? So you made that explicit. And I kind of thought, I wasn't surprised, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3746" target="_blank">01:02:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">because I kind of thought like, okay, JJ, I've always admired this guy's work. And he's now taken,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3751" target="_blank">01:02:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, I don't know if it's now I know it's intentional, but I didn't at the time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3755" target="_blank">01:02:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">it's intentional or not taken my work and made it better. And that's always, and I thought that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3760" target="_blank">01:02:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">great. We should, we should at least use that syntax. Yeah, sure. And then I started looking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3768" target="_blank">01:02:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">into like, at what you're doing with it. And I thought like, Oh, no, this is like a whole tool</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3774" target="_blank">01:02:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">set that does everything nb-convert does and a lot more. But it's also more delightful to work with,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3782" target="_blank">01:03:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">because it's got much better documentation, it's got much better defaults, it's, you know, the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3787" target="_blank">01:03:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">stuff that's built in for free is much better. And then when I spoke to you, because I kind of said</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3795" target="_blank">01:03:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">like, to you, like, you know, this feels like something I could build nb-dev2 on, tell me a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3802" target="_blank">01:03:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">bit about the technical foundation, like how is this working? And you explained to me, and I started</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3808" target="_blank">01:03:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">reading the source code to understand it, that it's actually this like relatively thin wrapper around</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3814" target="_blank">01:03:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">fantastic functionality that already exists in Pandoc. That's right. It's an orchestrator. Yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3821" target="_blank">01:03:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">which, you know, on a bunch of good defaults. So like, it's kind of like what fast.ai is to PyTorch,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3825" target="_blank">01:03:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">in a way. Right. It is this amazing foundational technology that's actually just too hard for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3831" target="_blank">01:03:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">people to get their head around. Yeah. Let's give you, like you said, good defaults, good ergonomics,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3837" target="_blank">01:03:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, and it's the same sort of thing. But also, Pandoc, I had so many problems with it. Like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3842" target="_blank">01:04:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, when I used it, it just very often didn't quite work, you know. So you've also like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3848" target="_blank">01:04:08.560</a></span> | <span class="t">just made sure it works. Like, oh, you know, that's unfortunate. Okay, make sure that works. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3855" target="_blank">01:04:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So nbdev2 is basically like, should look very, very similar to nbdev1 except for the pipes after</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3867" target="_blank">01:04:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">the comments. But it's dramatically faster. Partly because, well, partly because I wrote a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3878" target="_blank">01:04:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">stuff myself from scratch by using the Python AST.parse stuff. So I'm working with the abstract</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3885" target="_blank">01:04:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">insects directly. I'm making sure I only have a parse at once. I reuse the cache to AST, you know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3890" target="_blank">01:04:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And then partly because, you know, we leverage quarter, which is much faster than nbconvert.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3898" target="_blank">01:04:58.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's much faster. And it's kind of the code base, even though it does a lot more,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3905" target="_blank">01:05:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">it's a lot smaller, you know, than nbdev. Again, by kind of like trying to build better foundations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3912" target="_blank">01:05:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, the interesting thing, I noticed the title of your blog post was Use Notebooks for Everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3919" target="_blank">01:05:19.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And I, one thing that would be interesting to explore, so I kind of came up through this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3926" target="_blank">01:05:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">interactive computing metaphor, which was really defined by, have you heard of ESS,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3934" target="_blank">01:05:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">the emacs speak statistics? That was sort of this emacs mode for R and S, actually, originally,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3941" target="_blank">01:05:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and then R. And it was like, one of the things that it sort of said, you want everything to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3948" target="_blank">01:05:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">interactive and responsive, and you're always in a live session. The way they achieved that was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3953" target="_blank">01:05:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">through, rather than having a notebook, they did line by line execution. That's like the fundamental</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3958" target="_blank">01:05:58.240</a></span> | <span class="t">model is I select a line or a group of lines, and it can be smart syntactically, like, oh, I see the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3963" target="_blank">01:06:03.520</a></span> | <span class="t">line continues. And you just edit lines, basically. And then at some point, you might, like you did,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3968" target="_blank">01:06:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">reorganize that into functions and so on and so forth. And so one of my questions was, and I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3974" target="_blank">01:06:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">one of the most delightful and powerful things about notebooks for Python is that they give you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3980" target="_blank">01:06:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">this interactive development experience. I sort of see it, and you know, Smalltalk gives you an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3985" target="_blank">01:06:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">interactive development experience with yet another kind of way of organizing the interactive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3989" target="_blank">01:06:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">development. And so, you know, one of my questions is, and so we are building now, as we build tools,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=3995" target="_blank">01:06:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">we have this tradition from R of this ESS drive, kind of like line by line execution.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4001" target="_blank">01:06:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">You see your side effects, maybe in another pane or in a console. And then we have notebooks,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4006" target="_blank">01:06:46.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and we're sort of trying to do tooling for both. And one of my questions is, how much of what's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4012" target="_blank">01:06:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">amazing about notebooks, like, so there's multiple ideas wrapped up in notebooks. There's everything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4017" target="_blank">01:06:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">in one place, there's bundling output and, you know, and then there's interactive computing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4021" target="_blank">01:07:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">experience, and there's immediacy. Like, there's the thing that a lot of people hate, which is also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4027" target="_blank">01:07:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">state. And the state, right.

I can tell you a bit about my thoughts about,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4144" target="_blank">01:09:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, that would love to that.

And where do we go? Yeah. So so a lot of people are very into line by line based approaches</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4158" target="_blank">01:09:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">in Python as well, particularly using the the IPython REPL. Yep. Yeah, so. And it looks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4166" target="_blank">01:09:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">basically identical to how people coded in an APL 50 years ago, except they used a teletype,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4174" target="_blank">01:09:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, and it's based on that idea. And, you know, APL kind of invented that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4180" target="_blank">01:09:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">way of working. And, and APL was more than just a programming language, because it was your REPL,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4189" target="_blank">01:09:49.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that was also how you would like text chat, there was an APL command for that, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4194" target="_blank">01:09:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">like everything was, that was your, that was your OS, if you like. And there's nothing wrong with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4202" target="_blank">01:10:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that. But we have, you know, there are there are other ways, right? And so a notebook,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4207" target="_blank">01:10:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">you can do it top to bottom, if you want to. But you don't necessarily want to, because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4216" target="_blank">01:10:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">it's often nice to go back and change something a little bit earlier, to answer the question,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4223" target="_blank">01:10:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I wonder what happens if, right? And so you change that, you select the four cells underneath,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4228" target="_blank">01:10:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and you hit shift enter to run those four cells, it's like, Oh, well, what if I did this? And,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4233" target="_blank">01:10:33.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and then you kind of think, okay, let's try three different versions of that. So you copy and paste</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4238" target="_blank">01:10:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">those three cells twice, and then you select them, and then you run those with two different versions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4242" target="_blank">01:10:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and then you compare, you're doing experiments, you know, and the artifacts of those experiments</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4248" target="_blank">01:10:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">are right there, all in front of you. And that doesn't mean that then you're finished,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4257" target="_blank">01:10:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">right? Like, hopefully, you've learned something with that, that you're finding your understanding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4261" target="_blank">01:11:01.600</a></span> | <span class="t">of the problem, right? So then you kind of package it up a little bit, you kind of say, Okay, well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4265" target="_blank">01:11:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">for somebody reading this notebook, I want them to see these three different versions. And so like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4268" target="_blank">01:11:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe you put it into a little for loop, or maybe you create some kind of function to display it and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4273" target="_blank">01:11:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">put it on a graph or whatever. But it's, you know, for me, like there, there are two critical,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4280" target="_blank">01:11:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">critical keyboard shortcuts in notebooks, shift M and control shift hyphen, shift M merges two</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4286" target="_blank">01:11:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">cells together, and control shift hyphen splits them apart. And so I'm always like, grabbing a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4291" target="_blank">01:11:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">single line of code, I'm running it, I'm exploring it, I'm, you know, assigning it to something I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4297" target="_blank">01:11:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">trying to change fiddling with that. And after a while, I've got three lines of, you know, normally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4302" target="_blank">01:11:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">almost my functions are three to four lines of code, I've got the three lines of four to four</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4306" target="_blank">01:11:46.560</a></span> | <span class="t">lines of code that do that thing. And I just shift M a couple of times, you know, indent the block</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4312" target="_blank">01:11:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">underneath the death at a doc string. And then all those examples, they're all still there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4318" target="_blank">01:11:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">underneath. And so I had some pros before each one. And that's a nice way of working. Yeah, yeah. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4326" target="_blank">01:12:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">like, and as you say, particularly in deep learning, like sometimes I'll be like, Okay, well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4331" target="_blank">01:12:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to show how we can interact with like, a language model.

I think there's an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4361" target="_blank">01:12:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">issue, which is, it reminds me of my time in spreadsheets, you know, I have a huge fan of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4366" target="_blank">01:12:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">spreadsheets, even though a lot of people use them badly. Yeah. And I read a book 30 plus years ago,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4378" target="_blank">01:12:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">which is a book of spreadsheet style.

It's designed to be kind of like, you know, rather than grammar</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4392" target="_blank">01:13:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and style of English. It's kind of like, oh, sure, for spreadsheets. Yeah. And yeah, it explained,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4400" target="_blank">01:13:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">like, here's how you add careful auditing, error checking, self documentation, whatever the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4407" target="_blank">01:13:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">spreadsheets. And so ever since that, that, you know, I've tried to follow these rules so my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4412" target="_blank">01:13:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">spreadsheets. Yeah, it's, it's taking a very flexible tool and using that flexibility to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4419" target="_blank">01:13:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">create a process for using that tool, which works really well. Same with notebooks. If you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4424" target="_blank">01:13:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah, you can shoot yourself in the foot with them, but that doesn't mean we should tell people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4429" target="_blank">01:13:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">not to use them.

So yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4441" target="_blank">01:14:01.200</a></span> | <span class="t">so we're kind of adding, like, more stuff, more and more stuff. So something that I've built as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4445" target="_blank">01:14:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">part of nbdev2 is something called execnb, which is something which is just a tiny, tiny little Python</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4452" target="_blank">01:14:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">module that just runs notebooks.

And nbdev repo, I mentioned</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4474" target="_blank">01:14:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">it creates continuous integration for free.

So if you're on notebooks, don't work top to bottom. As soon as you commit, you're going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4483" target="_blank">01:14:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to find out. You're going to get an Instagram from GitHub. It's kind of harmless. It's harmless to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4489" target="_blank">01:14:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">create a local out-of-order notebook because it's going to get checked.

So, I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4493" target="_blank">01:14:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">yes, you've diluted yourself temporarily, but there's a net.

That makes sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4498" target="_blank">01:14:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. All right. So if I can come back to a quarto a bit, JJ, I wanted to understand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4509" target="_blank">01:15:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">where you're going with it and why. So you mentioned earlier that scientific programming</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4517" target="_blank">01:15:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">is broadly speaking something you were trying to, like, improve. But quarto is not just scientific</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4524" target="_blank">01:15:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">programming. You've got all this stuff about kind of scientific publishing as well. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4530" target="_blank">01:15:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So what are you trying to do with quarto and why are you trying to do it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4535" target="_blank">01:15:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, it's, and I would say it's, quarto is much more a scientific computing, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4541" target="_blank">01:15:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">that's what RStudio and Tidyverse and, you know, Arrow and all those projects are about scientific</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4548" target="_blank">01:15:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">computing. I'd say that quarto is very squarely about scientific communication. And I would say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4555" target="_blank">01:15:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">that there's a few things that just by working in the field for a little while, I have noted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4561" target="_blank">01:16:01.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that I think like warrant significant improvement. So one is the fact that we have scientific</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4570" target="_blank">01:16:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">communication for a lot of good reasons is very tied to print. And that the coin of the realm is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4576" target="_blank">01:16:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">these print articles. And that's fine. And there's good reasons for that. And there may even still</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4581" target="_blank">01:16:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">be good reasons for that in the age of the web, where, where, for example, a PDF is a more durable</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4586" target="_blank">01:16:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">entity than, you know, a website that might get taken down or have its links break, etc.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4591" target="_blank">01:16:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But maybe, maybe not. Okay. So what I'm saying is I've certainly seen some discussions where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4598" target="_blank">01:16:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">people say it's not a terrible thing to have a self-contained representation of your whatever,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4603" target="_blank">01:16:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">better to have like a Docker image that can run everything anyway. But so very tied to print. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4610" target="_blank">01:16:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">so one of the things is to help scientific communication take better advantage of the web</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4615" target="_blank">01:16:55.520</a></span> | <span class="t">while still not losing the focus on print. So not going completely like, hey, everything in now and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4622" target="_blank">01:17:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">in the future is web. But now all of a sudden, I actually can't write an article that I can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4626" target="_blank">01:17:06.240</a></span> | <span class="t">publish with that with that mindset. So that's one, one piece, another piece, which was huge</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4632" target="_blank">01:17:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">focus of the R community, which is reproducibility. And this idea that everything should be in a dot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4637" target="_blank">01:17:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">R, you know, in an R Markdown document that runs top to bottom, where your figures and your tables</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4641" target="_blank">01:17:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and your, your results and everything is all reproducible and produced by code. And so helping</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4647" target="_blank">01:17:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">people do that is a big motivator. So let me come back to the first one, which is about scientific</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4653" target="_blank">01:17:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">communication, making it more web friendly. Yeah, I guess like, why? Like, what's this got to do with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4663" target="_blank">01:17:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">R Studio? Or is this like, what's this got to do with you? Like, what do you, why do you care?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4667" target="_blank">01:17:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, what I was asking you with me was that, to me, my own, my own kind of beginning of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4672" target="_blank">01:17:52.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Renaissance was the, the, the Bill James baseball abstract, eyes opened. And then I get to its</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4679" target="_blank">01:17:59.520</a></span> | <span class="t">politics and my mentor is, is, is demonstrate. He's also like, wow, we're making decisions that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4686" target="_blank">01:18:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">affect hundreds of millions of people with no evidence or making medical decisions with no,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4691" target="_blank">01:18:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">not or no evidence, probably an exaggeration, but really weak under, under rigorously prepared</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4698" target="_blank">01:18:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and under-evaluated evidence. And so to me, it's just like doing science. Well, has a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4705" target="_blank">01:18:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">consequences. So this is like, this is a, this is a, this is a, this is a mission for you to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4714" target="_blank">01:18:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">science better. That's right. And John Chambers in his book about, about, about RNS software for data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4722" target="_blank">01:18:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">science. He actually has this concept in there, which I used in all my slides. It's called the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4726" target="_blank">01:18:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">prime directive, which is basically like accurate, trustworthy computing of scientific results is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4733" target="_blank">01:18:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">prime directive. It's really important for the same thing, for social policy, for medicine, for,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4739" target="_blank">01:18:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, just safety. So that's it. I mean, I was really compelled by that. So helping people do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4745" target="_blank">01:19:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">science really well and communicate technical content and persuasion well is to me very, very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4752" target="_blank">01:19:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">compelling. Is there something about like accessibility there as well for you, like making it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4758" target="_blank">01:19:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">like making science more accessible and making scientific publications, like more accessible?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4764" target="_blank">01:19:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Not per se. I'm taking scientific communication at face value, that it serves whatever purposes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4771" target="_blank">01:19:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">it serves and has whatever virtues it has.

And he sort of at the end, he says, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4802" target="_blank">01:20:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">really what we should be doing is giving each other handouts that have analysis and evidence and data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4808" target="_blank">01:20:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">We should be reading the handouts before the meeting, and then we should be talking about them,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4812" target="_blank">01:20:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, not, not pitching, you know, bullets at each other. So I was compelled by that too. So I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4817" target="_blank">01:20:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">was sort of very compelled by the idea, like, let's give people tools to communicate effectively</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4827" target="_blank">01:20:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">about technical matters and, and science. So that's, that's, that's very motivating to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4833" target="_blank">01:20:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So just showing this, this is the Tufti. It's a really great, yeah, they have, there's a really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4840" target="_blank">01:20:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">fun, funny thing in there where he says, here's what the, was it the Gettysburg Address would be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4845" target="_blank">01:20:45.840</a></span> | <span class="t">as a PowerPoint, you know, presentation. So, you know, it's, you know, similar ideas</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4852" target="_blank">01:20:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">in, like, how Amazon do things.

That's exactly what I'm talking about. Like, let's have a dialogue</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4886" target="_blank">01:21:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">about a matter of public health importance and use evidence and communicate a commute,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4892" target="_blank">01:21:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">do technical communication really effectively. The reason I asked about accessibility is that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4896" target="_blank">01:21:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, this, this, so this was an article that me and this team, this team and I wrote in April,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4908" target="_blank">01:21:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">early April 2020. So, you know, within a month really of the pandemic taking hold in the US.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4921" target="_blank">01:22:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, within a month. But it wasn't published, I mean, it says here accepted December the fifth,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4930" target="_blank">01:22:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and then I think it was published quite a bit later than that, maybe even.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4934" target="_blank">01:22:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So, by the time this was available on the proceedings of the National Academy of Science,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4942" target="_blank">01:22:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">it was almost obsolete, you know. But what we did do was we also put it on preprints.org,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4954" target="_blank">01:22:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">where it was there from, here we go, 10th of April. And these were very minor changes, right? So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4968" target="_blank">01:22:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and this version has received 439,000 views of the abstract and 98,000 downloads, which is the,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4977" target="_blank">01:22:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">by far the most viewed preprints.org paper of all time. And, you know, the fact that that was much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4989" target="_blank">01:23:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">more, you know, if we compare it like. Let me, let me, let me re-answer a question,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=4996" target="_blank">01:23:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">because when you say accessibility, I read that as the accessibility of the discourse.

And that's not per se a goal, but it is. But accessibility in the sense</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5010" target="_blank">01:23:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">of the way scientific publishing works, and the delays that are inherent in the progressive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5019" target="_blank">01:23:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">refinement of knowledge, and the various choke points that there are for publishing that gives</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5025" target="_blank">01:23:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">people credit for their careers. That is all kind of pretty messy. I don't have good ideas about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5032" target="_blank">01:23:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">personally about how to resolve that, but a lot of people do. And a lot of people are working hard</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5036" target="_blank">01:23:56.640</a></span> | <span class="t">at that. And so it is motivating to me to build, if I could build a tool that's widely adopted for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5043" target="_blank">01:24:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">scientific communication, that I can marry that to good ideas that are out there, and easier to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5049" target="_blank">01:24:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">adopt. I mean, that's kind of why I asked, because, yeah, like, that's kind of the number one goal,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5054" target="_blank">01:24:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">even though we got to a third, but that's a hope that I have.

But I didn't put it on a journal, I put it on our website,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5082" target="_blank">01:24:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">because I felt this is more accessible. And also, because like, I just couldn't be bothered,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5088" target="_blank">01:24:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">like doing all that latex stuff, and real links to real, you know, anybody can click on it and go there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5097" target="_blank">01:24:57.120</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a goal we have, which we haven't, it's not evident yet, we're working on it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5102" target="_blank">01:25:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">is that you should be able to basically create a blog like this, that's got this content, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5107" target="_blank">01:25:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and take this and repurpose that same content and send it to the journal. Exactly. That's,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5111" target="_blank">01:25:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">that's exactly what I want to do. It's like single source publishing, where you can be,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5115" target="_blank">01:25:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">you can almost be web first. And then, oh, look, we also know how to make, make LaTeX that you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5121" target="_blank">01:25:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">submit to the, to the other places that you need to get this published. And I can show you how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5126" target="_blank">01:25:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">horrible this looks nowadays. So I did exactly that for I did a paper about vaccine safety with my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5132" target="_blank">01:25:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">friend Yuri Manner. So Yuri wrote a study, or was a senior author on a study, which for whatever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5142" target="_blank">01:25:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">reason, got picked up by the conspiracy theorists, well, as showing that vaccines are harmful. And so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5153" target="_blank">01:25:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">him and I got together to write a paper that said, basically said, here's what that paper actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5160" target="_blank">01:26:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">says. So this is the paper here, LaTeX 2021. But again, after, you know, we actually wrote this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5170" target="_blank">01:26:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">probably in about April 2021. And in the end, I just, nobody had yet reviewed our submission.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5177" target="_blank">01:26:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And so in October, I just kind of went, oh, fuck it, I'm just putting it on the web. So I had to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5183" target="_blank">01:26:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">take that LaTeX document and turn it into web. And I did use pandoc to help me. But as you can see,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5190" target="_blank">01:26:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">we end up with these like, oh, yeah, kind of references that I had to kind of paste them down</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5195" target="_blank">01:26:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">at the bottom. And then here, let me show you go to the GitHub, or this will be out by the time this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5201" target="_blank">01:26:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">video broadcast, there's GitHub org called quarto dash journals. And this should show you yeah. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5211" target="_blank">01:26:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">basically, we're working on journals. So you can see like, you know, if you go to one of those,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5217" target="_blank">01:26:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">let's see what it shows you. Yeah, so scroll down. Anyway, it's not it's not showing you but go to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5223" target="_blank">01:27:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that go to that template that qmd file there. And you'll see sort of an example of, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5230" target="_blank">01:27:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you've got, you know, your metadata, your authors, your, you know, all the stuff you need to do,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5235" target="_blank">01:27:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">it's making the LaTeX that the journal wants, including get off and getting all the fiddly bits,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5239" target="_blank">01:27:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">right. But then the same exact content is going to render perfectly in HTML.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5244" target="_blank">01:27:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">That's great. It's gonna do everything that is going to do everything right. So that's I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5250" target="_blank">01:27:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the idea is, let's just write in quarto. And now we're going to be able to put it in on on the web,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5256" target="_blank">01:27:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe web only, you know, but also that world of publishing my god, I was so shocked when I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5262" target="_blank">01:27:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">discovered how it works for this for this penis thing. And if the penis is, I think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5268" target="_blank">01:27:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">like the third highest impact journal in the world. And so, you know, I thought like, oh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5271" target="_blank">01:27:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">this is going to be a smooth professional experience. And, you know, I did the whole</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5276" target="_blank">01:27:56.640</a></span> | <span class="t">thing in Overleaf and LaTeX and bibtech and just fine, it was pretty easy. And thanks to Overleaf,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5282" target="_blank">01:28:02.560</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, with all 19 of us authors could collaborate by working on different sections.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5286" target="_blank">01:28:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And so then when it came to publishing it, you know, I had to upload the rendered PDF.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5294" target="_blank">01:28:14.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so I uploaded the rendered PDF, I wasn't quite sure how that was going to help them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5298" target="_blank">01:28:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, you know, like, a while later, yeah, they contact me and say, like, okay, we now need you to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5306" target="_blank">01:28:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">like, look at these questions. They were basically they put annotations in the PDF, which is already</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5316" target="_blank">01:28:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of hard to work with. So I ended up trying to like reply in the PDF to the and then eventually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5323" target="_blank">01:28:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">they're like, okay, now you have to go through and look at the kind of camera ready document,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5328" target="_blank">01:28:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">whatever, and look at these things. And they sent me back a Word document. And they've taken the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5333" target="_blank">01:28:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">whole thing and redone it in Word. Yeah, just wait for it. So then, so then they're like, okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5344" target="_blank">01:29:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">they had a question about a reference. They're like, maybe this reference doesn't really make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5348" target="_blank">01:29:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">sense there. I think they said you're not allowed to use it because it violates some rule or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5354" target="_blank">01:29:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">something. I was like, I don't want to fight about this as far as this, fine, you can get rid of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5357" target="_blank">01:29:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And they're like, okay, so what you need to do is remove that, then renumber all the references</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5362" target="_blank">01:29:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">afterwards. Exactly. There's 150 references. And this is reference. Well, this is what yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5366" target="_blank">01:29:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">this is what like a proper, you know, scientific markdown system will do that. We'll remember</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5372" target="_blank">01:29:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">everything. So I just said, I just said no. I've made that change in the late tech is the PDF with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5379" target="_blank">01:29:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the correction. Yeah, you fix it. Well, I almost view it as like, you have to give people tools that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5387" target="_blank">01:29:47.120</a></span> | <span class="t">help them with the problems they have now. And, you know, which is I need to interact with all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5391" target="_blank">01:29:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">these journals and publishing systems. And then you have a chance to help them, you know, evolve</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5396" target="_blank">01:29:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">what they do and help them do things they never thought were possible. So I think that's one of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5402" target="_blank">01:30:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the reasons like we are focused on really tooling late tech well and letting you know, we're very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5408" target="_blank">01:30:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">focused on that, even though we think, wow, it should be great if we didn't have late tech,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5412" target="_blank">01:30:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">we're not we're not ignoring it, we're saying, okay, we'll tool that and but we'll also tool the web.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5417" target="_blank">01:30:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And it'll be great. And we'll all get there eventually. So that's now can I ask some,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5423" target="_blank">01:30:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm very, very excited about this, by the way, I love that, like, this is something I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5428" target="_blank">01:30:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">passionate about. Yeah, it like a kind of a slightly weird way in that like, I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5432" target="_blank">01:30:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">passionately anti how academia works to the level that everybody was assuming I would go into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5439" target="_blank">01:30:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">academia following school, and I refuse to know the basis that I didn't like how academia worked.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5445" target="_blank">01:30:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. And I've now finally come full circle. I am actually a professor. But, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5453" target="_blank">01:30:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">only because I'm able to do it on my terms, and I totally refuse to do any of the normal things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5459" target="_blank">01:30:59.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's, it's great to have you involved in this fight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5462" target="_blank">01:31:02.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, we are going to be very involved. We have a couple of questions from the community.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5467" target="_blank">01:31:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So, okay, so this one is actually asked to me, but I wouldn't mind asking it to you as well. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5475" target="_blank">01:31:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">then I can come back to myself. This person said, for Jeremy, your productivity amazes many people,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5482" target="_blank">01:31:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">including myself, do you have any tips that might be valid in general? What does your usual day look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5487" target="_blank">01:31:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">like? Now, I feel the same way about you, JJ, I'm amazed at what you've done and what you do. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5494" target="_blank">01:31:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Hamill and I are both, you know, like, well, how does JJ do all these things so, so quickly? So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5502" target="_blank">01:31:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah, I'd love to hear your well, I would say that, to me, the main lever for productivity is not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5513" target="_blank">01:31:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">how fast you can code that that certainly helps. I think it's more what problems do I choose to solve</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5522" target="_blank">01:32:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and, and what order and at what level of depth, you know, to me, getting through a problem,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5528" target="_blank">01:32:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">or a problem domain is about making those choices.

So I think that a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5539" target="_blank">01:32:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">of that just comes from experience. So I think there's the choosing what problems to work on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5545" target="_blank">01:32:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And that I think you can you can you can level yourself up by talking over what you're planning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5551" target="_blank">01:32:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">to do with other people. And so I was thinking of trying to solve this and then this, and then they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5555" target="_blank">01:32:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">say, huh, well, why is that important?

Yeah, I would say two, two trade-offs. One</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5873" target="_blank">01:37:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">was going back to the discussion we had earlier about leaky abstractions, how leaky an abstraction</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5879" target="_blank">01:37:59.200</a></span> | <span class="t">over pandoc should be, because our markdown actually fully, it's pretty fully abstracted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5885" target="_blank">01:38:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">pandoc. Like you just used all these R functions and you didn't even know pandoc was there. And if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5891" target="_blank">01:38:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">any given piece of functionality needed in pandoc, you know, you needed to address, you need some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5897" target="_blank">01:38:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">hacky way to work around the fact that we've written this wrapper. And so for quarto, I went</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5902" target="_blank">01:38:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">with a more leaky abstraction, which basically says like everything that's in pandoc is kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5907" target="_blank">01:38:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">there pass through. Partly that's because pandoc had evolved. It used to be that it could only</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5913" target="_blank">01:38:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">accept a lot of things by command line parameters. And so now it can take everything through YAML.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5918" target="_blank">01:38:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so like, it became a system that you could interact with more reasonably without a special</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5924" target="_blank">01:38:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">wrapper. And so, you know, that I felt like if we decided to try to wrap it, it was going to be kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5932" target="_blank">01:38:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">of a losing game, trying to keep up with everything people were trying to do was by making it leaky,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5936" target="_blank">01:38:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">we would sort of pre-roll on everybody's knowledge of pandoc and all the things that are in pandoc.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5942" target="_blank">01:39:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So that was one. And the other one, I think, which we didn't really decide on until about a year into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5947" target="_blank">01:39:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the project, was how much we should be batteries included, or how much we should be sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=5952" target="_blank">01:39:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">extension and plugin driven.

And so that's a nice, a nice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=6068" target="_blank">01:41:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, Hamel and I were talking about that this morning. Alright, so if I answer to this question,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=6073" target="_blank">01:41:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I think, you know, the main one is actually not just about nvdev, but kind of everything we do,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=6079" target="_blank">01:41:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">which is in Python, there's a schism between treating it as a kind of a static language that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=6087" target="_blank">01:41:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you write a bit like Java, versus a highly dynamic language that you write a bit like Lisp.

And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=6214" target="_blank">01:43:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't understand how this ever became a thing, because as soon as you say that you basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=6222" target="_blank">01:43:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">turn off innovation, because if you want to do something better, you're not allowed to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=6225" target="_blank">01:43:45.840</a></span> | <span class="t">because you've just created a second way to do it. And so the Python community often is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=6232" target="_blank">01:43:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, or at least this kind of core group is often quite anti fast AI stuff,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=6238" target="_blank">01:43:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">because we're a second way to do it for all values of it.

And, you know, I think that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=6262" target="_blank">01:44:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">really problematic, whereas our seems to really, this seems a much more flourishing, welcoming and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=6269" target="_blank">01:44:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">diverse community than the Python community does feel that way.

In this case, I have my notebook that defines a bunch of functions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=6374" target="_blank">01:46:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and exports things. And I can generate a website from that you could think of, you know, it has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=6379" target="_blank">01:46:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">real time elements. So it's not a perfect analog, but like TensorBoard, there's these artifacts</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=6384" target="_blank">01:46:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">created in a directory, and then they create this web experience from it. And so I do think there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=6389" target="_blank">01:46:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of things in the Bioconductor project had this thing pre R markdown, but they have these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=6395" target="_blank">01:46:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">S4 objects that were very complicated, they could have like gene sequences in them and all kinds of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=6400" target="_blank">01:46:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">stuff. And if you just literally get you call it a function, pass the object, it makes a website</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=6405" target="_blank">01:46:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">from it, you know, so I think that this idea of having different types of software artifacts,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=6409" target="_blank">01:46:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and then just creating websites from them is really interesting. And obviously, like documentation for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=6414" target="_blank">01:46:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">a software package is one variant of that, but there are other ones. And the other is, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=6420" target="_blank">01:47:00.160</a></span> | <span class="t">we sort of promote, hey, look, you can make a website, you can make a book, but you can pretty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=6424" target="_blank">01:47:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">much you can feed just about any publishing pipeline through, you know, from notebooks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=6430" target="_blank">01:47:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">through quarter into the publishing pipeline. So like, you know, you if you've got a big Hugo</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=6435" target="_blank">01:47:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">website, you can you can pump markdown into that, or you have you're using confluence, and you need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=6441" target="_blank">01:47:21.280</a></span> | <span class="t">to put all your articles there, you can pump things. So start building these publishing pipelines</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=6447" target="_blank">01:47:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">downstream of Cordo to these other because, you know, it's great that you can easily make a website,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=6451" target="_blank">01:47:31.120</a></span> | <span class="t">but oftentimes you need to get it, you need to get your content somewhere else. And so, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=6455" target="_blank">01:47:35.920</a></span> | <span class="t">hopefully, we can teach people how to do this, how to do this. I mean, it's all possible. I remember</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=6460" target="_blank">01:47:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you guys asked about Docosaurus.

That was one of my questions, too. So that's good. All right, so I'm just gonna totally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=6498" target="_blank">01:48:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">hand that over to somebody else much smarter than me, who's thought about it for long than me,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=6502" target="_blank">01:48:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">which is Brett Victor.

And so I think to me, you know, as I say, it's not so much about literate programming,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVVSxcjNQs&t=6522" target="_blank">01:48:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">it's about exploratory programming.
