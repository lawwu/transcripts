And what I mean by that is help somebody who's struggling with the same thing as you. When I wrote Leader's Eat Last, I went and looked at Alcoholics Anonymous, amazing organization. Alcoholics Anonymous has a 12-step program to help you beat your addiction.</p><p>Most people will know the first step, admit you have a problem. I don't have any friends, I don't know how to make friends. Okay, that's step one. But the magical thing about Alcoholics Anonymous and all of those 12-step programs is they know this. They have the data, which is if you master 11 steps, but not the 12th, you're probably gonna succumb to the disease.</p><p>But if you master the 12th step, you're more likely to beat it. What's the 12th step? The 12th step is to help another alcoholic. Service. So don't worry about you. I got it. You're struggling to make friends, you don't know how to make friends. I got it. Find somebody you know who's also struggling to make friends and wishes they could make friends and help them.</p><p>And the act of service of helping them solve the problem that you're struggling with will solve your problem.</p></div></div></body></html>
