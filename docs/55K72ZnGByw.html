He sang,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55K72ZnGByw&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">he was singing a little song. And I started to cry and thought, "Okay, this man</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55K72ZnGByw&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.640</a></span> | <span class="t">might be ready to hear me sing or say something." And on the other hand, Tony,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55K72ZnGByw&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I've walked into a room and the first thing a husband said to me with his wife</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55K72ZnGByw&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.400</a></span> | <span class="t">in emergency surgery after heart attack was, "John, tell us something important</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55K72ZnGByw&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.360</a></span> | <span class="t">from the Word.

So I know that that during</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55K72ZnGByw&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the moment, right in the moment of loss, there's time for silence, there's a time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55K72ZnGByw&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">for speaking. And then afterwards, we should remember to help people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55K72ZnGByw&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.800</a></span> | <span class="t">afterwards. My mom died in 1974. I still get emails from people who remember</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55K72ZnGByw&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.520</a></span> | <span class="t">December 16 for me. Isn't that amazing? They write to me and say, "Thinking about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55K72ZnGByw&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.840</a></span> | <span class="t">your mom and what she meant to me on that.

So it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55K72ZnGByw&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">matters that we get our people ready before, during, and after. And I think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55K72ZnGByw&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Tony, most of our effort goes into helping them before, because that's where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55K72ZnGByw&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">we spend most of our time.

We're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55K72ZnGByw&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">preparing for it most of our life. And so I think we as pastors have to think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55K72ZnGByw&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">through all of our options, and we have our pulpit, we have maybe a newsletter, we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55K72ZnGByw&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.440</a></span> | <span class="t">have maybe a blog or a Twitter account, we always have a bedside to go to. And I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55K72ZnGByw&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.920</a></span> | <span class="t">think a pastor has to always be thinking, "How is what I'm doing preparing my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55K72ZnGByw&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">people?"
