href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=66" target="_blank">00:01:06.680</a></span> | <span class="t">incredible product experiences like Vercel's V0, Replit Agent, and Perplexity's API.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=72" target="_blank">00:01:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So with this experience, the goal of my talk today is to share some stories from the field and bring</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=77" target="_blank">00:01:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">forward some of this bleeding-edge experimentation and ideas that are forming on the world of AI pricing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=85" target="_blank">00:01:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think a good place to start is to really think about what is unique and complex about AI pricing specifically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I think software pricing has always been a little bit of an art and a science, and there's always been some considerations around how to get it right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But there are three things in particular that make considerations around AI pricing perhaps more challenging than they've been before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, first of all, things are changing dramatically quickly in terms of model and inference costs, in terms of capabilities, in terms of new products being launched.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=114" target="_blank">00:01:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So just that the pace of this evolution makes it hard to keep pace on the pricing side.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Second, these AI technologies create some real pressures on margins and cogs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So the thing that we could do maybe 10 years ago of like shipping our products and we'll figure out how to price them down the line is much harder to do when that anthropic or open AI bill is very steep and significant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And then third, amidst all this experimentation, exploration, I think customers are really, really hungry to understand what is the ROI that they are getting from some of these technologies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So this makes AI pricing uniquely challenging and this is even greater so when we keep getting blown away and surprised by the kind of adoption trends and just uptake that a lot of these products have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">When I say that AI pricing is challenging, I really mean that it's kind of challenging for everybody, where notably we've seen even cases where ChowGBT Pro at $200 turned out to be a loss driver for the company.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So I come today to you with an idea that perhaps as an industry we should not be pricing on Vibes and there is a potentially better way to do this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So to drive my point forward, I have come to you with three simple frameworks and one tool to share with you some ideas and frameworks for how to think about AI pricing and share with you a tool we've built at Orb that is really helping some teams make the right decisions around their monetization.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So first and foremost, like should you monetize AI and how should you think about that experience?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So over here I have a kind of simple framework that is one of my favorites, it was created by the folks at Simon Kutcher and it really starts asking about this idea of how should you think about monetization?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Should it be a direct monetization strategy where you are either selling something as a standalone product or charging for it as an add-on or should it be an indirect monetization strategy where perhaps you're using it to drive upsells into existing products or tiers that you have or maybe even bundling it for free because it's incentivizing the right behavior you want to see in your customers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's look at some examples, this is GitHub Copilot, they launched it as a separable monetizable add-on on top of the base GitHub seat, an important consideration here is, is this new product, this new feature adding value to everybody in your audience or just a niche group of folks and when it's maybe not everybody with a GitHub seat is going to get value out of this, maybe an add-on monetization strategy is a really good one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Second, second example here is Notion and Notion AI, notably they were first to market in their category and initially launched Notion AI as an add-on like GitHub Copilot still is but recently they've bundled this into their business and enterprise tiers to kind of encourage more adoption there and as part of that they've done some price increases on those tiers so they're finding ways to kind of encourage the adoption that they want to see at those higher tiers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Finally, this is a little bit of a more off the beaten path example, a month ago Expedia launched a new AI powered feature that lets you turn Instagram reels into bookable trips and they're not charging for this, they have like released this out for free.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.160</a></span> | <span class="t">They're doing this, they're doing this and while swallowing those costs to serve and model inference costs to power this capability because likely they are hoping to see a lot more bookings of travel as a result of this capability.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, this is an example of cases where you might even want to indirectly monetize where you're not charging for this right away but you are incenting the behavior that then will continue to fuel your revenue growth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=353" target="_blank">00:05:53.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Having explored like should you even monetize this, how do we actually do it and I think one of the most important considerations here is to make sure that you are picking and selecting the correct value metric.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's take the space of AI agents where literally AI agents are redefining the way that we get value out of software where before we measured the value of software by getting a login into a web application that we could like spend our days in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=382" target="_blank">00:06:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Now we have AI agents that are out there doing work for us or achieving automation or achieving outcomes for us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=389" target="_blank">00:06:29.160</a></span> | <span class="t">How do we price that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I think what we're seeing out in the field especially over the last six months is that there's a little bit of a spectrum in terms of how tightly aligned to discrete units of value or more closely aligned to ROI do you want to be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's sort of a spectrum between very resource based or token based monetization models proxies of value like steps in a workflow maybe entire workflows perhaps even more direct labor replacement type strategies where just like you would hire a consultant per hour maybe you would hire an agent per hour all the way to true outcome based pricing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=426" target="_blank">00:07:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's run through some of these examples again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=428" target="_blank">00:07:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So here's Vercel's V0 they have a token based model based on very granular capabilities and I think this aligns really closely with their audience the developer that I think really wants to understand some of the capabilities that they can drive over there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=442" target="_blank">00:07:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">On the other hand here's Zapier they deliver automation at scale and they've gone with a task based pricing strategy where various tasks in an entire workflow or zap are the unit of value that you end up paying for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=457" target="_blank">00:07:37.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And you actually subscribe to a certain number of tasks per month or can go over if you are exceeding that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=464" target="_blank">00:07:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And then finally there is true outcome based pricing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=467" target="_blank">00:07:47.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is intercom's fin where the way fin is priced is it charges 99 cents per successful customer support ticket resolution where literally if the end user at the end of that support interaction says yes that answered my query and I don't need to escalate to a human solution.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=486" target="_blank">00:08:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">To escalate to a human support agent that's where fin charges for 99 cents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=491" target="_blank">00:08:11.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you've been on LinkedIn you've probably seen a thing or two about outcome based pricing because I think it is very much actively being discussed and actively being explored.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=500" target="_blank">00:08:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe the hidden secret is that outside of this customer experience category customer support space.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=505" target="_blank">00:08:25.160</a></span> | <span class="t">It's really hard to find many examples of this working really well quite yet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=511" target="_blank">00:08:31.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So perhaps this is still kind of more on the emerging side.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=514" target="_blank">00:08:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And why is that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=515" target="_blank">00:08:35.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Because ultimately customer and vendor need to align on what the definition of the outcome is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=520" target="_blank">00:08:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And need to furthermore be able to measure it in a somewhat objective way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=525" target="_blank">00:08:45.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So when you're dealing with a customer support ticket interaction that's very clear and simple.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=529" target="_blank">00:08:49.160</a></span> | <span class="t">You can ask hey did this resolve your question and you can see whether this needed to be escalated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=534" target="_blank">00:08:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">But whenever you're trying to proxy things that are maybe more creative or perhaps more you know less directly tied to dollars and cents as can be measured by the cost that support teams incur for businesses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=549" target="_blank">00:09:09.160</a></span> | <span class="t">That's been a little harder.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=551" target="_blank">00:09:11.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So ultimately what I find very inspiring and exciting about outcome based pricing is that it's not a proxy for ROI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=558" target="_blank">00:09:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">It's literally ROI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=560" target="_blank">00:09:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think as an industry this year and for many years thereafter I think we're going to continue trying to find ways to crack this code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=567" target="_blank">00:09:27.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And find the right way to align outcomes and measure outcomes such that this aligns with everybody.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=575" target="_blank">00:09:35.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So lastly having explored like a couple of frameworks and ideas for how to price.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=581" target="_blank">00:09:41.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I think what's really important is to build a muscle around thinking about pricing strategy as something that needs continual evolution and experimentation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=590" target="_blank">00:09:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe ten years ago when we were building SaaS what we could do is like ship a product.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=595" target="_blank">00:09:55.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Pick or guess a price point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=597" target="_blank">00:09:57.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And then spent you know a year, two years, three years building and adding value to that product.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=602" target="_blank">00:10:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we might realize like oh you know what we actually have to catch up to all this value that we've created.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=607" target="_blank">00:10:07.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And think about doing a big large painful price increase.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=611" target="_blank">00:10:11.160</a></span> | <span class="t">But nowadays with AI when you know new model drops can reduce cost by 10x or increase cost by 10x literally overnight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=621" target="_blank">00:10:21.160</a></span> | <span class="t">like Cloud4 did.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=622" target="_blank">00:10:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I think this kind of one, two, three year cycle of pricing iteration just doesn't cut it anymore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=628" target="_blank">00:10:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So what we see is that the best teams out there are able to find ways to really drive a lot of experimentation and continual evolution in their pricing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=638" target="_blank">00:10:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And as we've been talking about pricing strategy I think it's important to remember that it all comes down to not just the price point but rather the cohesive entire experience around pricing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=648" target="_blank">00:10:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Everything from how you package features into different tiers or how you think about rate limits or volumes or even custom terms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=655" target="_blank">00:10:55.160</a></span> | <span class="t">how you design this but more importantly how you communicate this to customers contributes to that overall alignment of price to value.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=662" target="_blank">00:11:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And should be something that we find teams need to and should be continually experimenting around.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=668" target="_blank">00:11:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So how is this actually done and how are we finding, how are we helping teams do this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=677" target="_blank">00:11:17.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I wanted to share a little demo with you of Orb Simulations which is a product that we've built around this idea of helping customers find their right AI pricing strategies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=690" target="_blank">00:11:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So let me tell you a little bit of a story here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=692" target="_blank">00:11:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">For context, this is Orb.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=694" target="_blank">00:11:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">We are connected and integrated with a raw and real-time stream of product usage events where what you're measuring and instrumenting in your application you can send into Orb for billing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=706" target="_blank">00:11:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And we've created a very flexible billing offering where folks can come in and be able to monitor in real-time what their accrued costs are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=719" target="_blank">00:11:59.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and get a sense of how much charges our customers racking up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=723" target="_blank">00:12:03.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, this idea is like the marriage of an analytics product with a billing product connected together to really drive a lot of that real-time insights.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=732" target="_blank">00:12:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">But last year, in about the last six months, what we were noticing was a lot of our customers were using our product in a little bit of an unexpected way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=743" target="_blank">00:12:23.160</a></span> | <span class="t">What they were doing is they were sending data into Orb and then they were setting up shell pricing structures on top of that data, but not actually billing their customers for it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=753" target="_blank">00:12:33.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And we didn't understand why they were doing that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=756" target="_blank">00:12:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So we called a few of them up and it turns out that they were running the closed beta periods of a few upcoming product launches.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=764" target="_blank">00:12:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And several of those were the closed beta periods of AI agent products coming up to market.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=770" target="_blank">00:12:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So these teams had a product build, they had a group of customers that they wanted to start to get feedback from, but weren't fully pencils down on what exactly was the right pricing strategy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=782" target="_blank">00:13:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And they were trying to hack Orb into figuring that out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=785" target="_blank">00:13:05.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So what we did is we built a whole product experience around helping that workflow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=789" target="_blank">00:13:09.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So what simulations lets you do is back test or test out alternate pricing strategies on top of that data platform of product usage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=800" target="_blank">00:13:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's designed to help teams really answer that what if question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=803" target="_blank">00:13:23.160</a></span> | <span class="t">What if we tried pricing in that way or what if we experimented with a different model?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=807" target="_blank">00:13:27.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Let me show you how that works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=809" target="_blank">00:13:29.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So in Orb, you can come in and define a simulation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=812" target="_blank">00:13:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So maybe for our demo over here, we're going to pick a simulation time period that perhaps is going to span the period of our closed beta.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=821" target="_blank">00:13:41.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And we're going to pick a cohort of customers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=823" target="_blank">00:13:43.160</a></span> | <span class="t">This might be just customers that are not yet paying in that closed beta period or might even be a group of existing customers that are paying for a previous or older version of your pricing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=835" target="_blank">00:13:55.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And that they're about to get a new kind of value.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=838" target="_blank">00:13:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And what we enable you to do is to build out scenarios for alternate ways to price.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=843" target="_blank">00:14:03.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So maybe we can start with our baseline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=845" target="_blank">00:14:05.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And what we're going to do is try more of an add-on based pricing strategy where what we'll do is maybe come in and say, we want to add a fixed fee.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=855" target="_blank">00:14:15.160</a></span> | <span class="t">We're going to charge everybody $20 for AI agent access.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=861" target="_blank">00:14:21.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Alternatively, we might want to add a more granular or discrete pricing strategy where we can come in and actually charge for tokens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=870" target="_blank">00:14:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And perhaps for those tokens, we want to charge a simple unit price or maybe more of a tiered fee where some tokens come included for free and others are charged on top of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=880" target="_blank">00:14:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, the idea here is to really help you build a different set of pricing possibilities so that you can help answer your ideas about how to price in a rich data informed way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=892" target="_blank">00:14:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So when we run that simulation, what we'll generate is a report that shows you a lot of insights and angle points into this decision of how you should price.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=904" target="_blank">00:15:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So first and foremost, between these scenarios that we've outlined, we'll show you what the biggest impact to top line revenue is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=911" target="_blank">00:15:11.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can kind of understand based on the actual consumption usage patterns of your customers, which pricing scenario might be the most effective one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=920" target="_blank">00:15:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">But if anybody who's lived in this world knows and understands that it's not just about top line revenue, when you're dealing with existing customers that are paying you a certain way or a certain amount,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=931" target="_blank">00:15:31.160</a></span> | <span class="t">it's kind of hard just to hike up pricing on them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=934" target="_blank">00:15:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So getting an understanding of what the lowest average change to existing customers will be is also really important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=941" target="_blank">00:15:41.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what we give you is a very detailed view into the revenue mix that you might expect based on a particular pricing strategy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=948" target="_blank">00:15:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And even a scatter plot that shows you percentage magnitude change as well as revenue impact for different customers, obviously with an exportable data set of impact to each individual customers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=960" target="_blank">00:16:00.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the big idea here is to break through a lot of this fear, uncertainty and doubt of how should I price with data and help teams, you know, if you will, travel time or really help explore the space of pricing possibilities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=976" target="_blank">00:16:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So that when you get to that moment where you're ready to launch, you're doing so very confidently and with certainty of what that impact is going to be to your existing customer base.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=985" target="_blank">00:16:25.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's orb simulations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=987" target="_blank">00:16:27.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, really the idea here is if you really want to help you not have to price on vibes, or ideally we'll give you some tools and our perspective is that AI builders should always simulate first before putting something out to market.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=1003" target="_blank">00:16:43.160</a></span> | <span class="t">To close up over here, you know, we've explored some ideas around how to price, first of all, thinking about should you even monetize directly or indirectly, then explore the value metric selection question, just making sure that the way you're pricing really aligns to the value that you want your customers to perceive from your product and to incent the behavior that you want them to take.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=1028" target="_blank">00:17:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And then thirdly, really explored how experimentation and thinking about pricing evolution in a continual way is not just valuable, but really critical and important for these kind of AI products.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=1043" target="_blank">00:17:23.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So you might be thinking that this is hard or tricky. Well, it is hard or tricky. But what we've seen with our customers is that they've been able to achieve truly headline inspiring results on their revenue front and get their amazing products to the right audiences by finding that aligned and correct pricing strategy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=1065" target="_blank">00:17:45.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And we've really, and we've really been able to see up close that when you can get it right or when you can converge to right, the impact can be huge and valuable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=1076" target="_blank">00:17:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">We are going to be hanging out today on Booth G17. So if you're curious about how you should bring your new AI products out to market or if you want more data points or ideas about how folks are thinking about AI pricing, we'd love to chat. Thank you very much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WQYLQB0odc&t=1091" target="_blank">00:18:11.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you very much.</span></div></div></body></html>
