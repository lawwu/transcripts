But this conference is an expansion of a conference that we did for many years, mainly in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the Philadelphia area when Jack Bogle was still alive. We have decided to move it from city to city</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.980</a></span> | <span class="t">since Jack passed away and since we came through the post-COVID period. So this year's conference is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.380</a></span> | <span class="t">going to be up in Minneapolis. We have a lively Bogleheads chapter in the Minneapolis area, and they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.660</a></span> | <span class="t">had indicated that they were happy to help us identify the venue and source volunteers. So we want it to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.220</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of a grassroots effort because we have these fantastic chapters that are doing wonderful work</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.060</a></span> | <span class="t">already. So we have, I think, one of our best rosters ever. Each year, I think, well, this is the best we've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.720</a></span> | <span class="t">ever done. But this year, it really is just a fabulous lineup of individuals, all of whom have volunteered</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.860</a></span> | <span class="t">their time to be there. I think that's an important component of this Bogleheads conference. There's no pay to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.100</a></span> | <span class="t">play, there are no booths, there's no marketing, no advertising, none of the things for people who have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.940</a></span> | <span class="t">been to any sort of financial conference, none of those trappings. You won't see the breakfast breaks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.780</a></span> | <span class="t">sponsored by iShares or anything like nothing against iShares, but we do not have any of those sponsorships.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.820</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just paid for by each attendee's registration fee, and each of the speakers has volunteered their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.580</a></span> | <span class="t">time to be there. And in many cases, these are speakers who fetch a pretty good speaker fee</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.620</a></span> | <span class="t">on the open market when they are speaking at various financial conferences. But everyone's there for free,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.660</a></span> | <span class="t">so it's all in the spirit of education and improving all of the conference attendees' financial well-being.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So I always learn a lot. I think people will learn a lot. Last year in Washington DC, that was a near sellout, maybe a sellout.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.380</a></span> | <span class="t">We had close to 500 attendees. I'm expecting the same mish for Minneapolis, so people shouldn't tarry. I expect that we at some point may fully sell out, which would be about 500 people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, that's fantastic. Oh, I'm looking forward to it. There's a tremendous roster of speakers there, and you get to meet all the speakers too. Everybody is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.060</a></span> | <span class="t">there walking around, milling around, and corner them if you can, and ask them whatever questions you wish to ask. So, again, that's in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The dates?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.060</a></span> | <span class="t">September 27th through 29th. And one thing, Rick, I would mention for this year's conference, a couple of interesting emphases.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.900</a></span> | <span class="t">One is, I know a lot of Vogelheads are interested in safe withdrawal rates, and we just have a power team to discuss safe withdrawal rates. William Bangian, who many people know as the father of the 4% guideline, will be there. Karsten Geske, who is a FIRE participant. He's financial independence, retire early, but talks about safe spending guidelines when you have a very long time horizon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.380</a></span> | <span class="t">John Guyton, the creator of the guardrails approach to retirement spending, will be there. John Reckenthaler, my colleague and co-collaborator on some research we do at Morningstar on safe spending rates.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.180</a></span> | <span class="t">That's an interesting emphasis, as is the fact that we've got some of the leading lights of the FIRE movement at this conference. So, I mentioned Karsten. Paula Pant will also be speaking. Paula has her own podcast, Call Afford Anything. I think she's one of the leading lights in the FIRE space.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I think she's one of the leading lights in the FIRE space, if people are interested in the financial independence movement. We've got some terrific speakers for them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=389" target="_blank">00:06:29.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I'm looking forward to it. Now we're going to talk about you. Congratulations on writing and publishing. It's soon to be released on September 17th.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.180</a></span> | <span class="t">How to Retire: 20 Lessons for a Happy, Successful and Wealthy Retirement</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=409" target="_blank">00:06:49.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I just want to read what Michael Kitsis wrote about your book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=413" target="_blank">00:06:53.180</a></span> | <span class="t">In Christine Benz, How to Retire: Prospective retirees gain valuable perspective on why the day-to-day experience of life in retirement can be more challenging than anticipated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=425" target="_blank">00:07:05.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And how they need to prepare, both financially and beyond their finances, to ensure they actually find fulfillment in their decades to come.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=434" target="_blank">00:07:14.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I thought that was a good introduction into really what this book is about. It's much more than about money.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=439" target="_blank">00:07:19.180</a></span> | <span class="t">That was definitely the goal of the book, Rick, because the more I've looked at retirement planning, the more I've concluded that it's not a math problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=449" target="_blank">00:07:29.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Definitely, you need to look at the numbers. You need to make sure that you have the resources to retire on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=455" target="_blank">00:07:35.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But a lot of successful retirement, in my view, is about some of the softer aspects of life in retirement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=463" target="_blank">00:07:43.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So what is going to give you purpose later in life? Where will you go for your relationships? If you had important relationships through your work, how will you replace them?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=475" target="_blank">00:07:55.180</a></span> | <span class="t">All of those considerations, how will you take care of your health? Those things, I think, are even more impactful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=483" target="_blank">00:08:03.180</a></span> | <span class="t">A lot of people who write these books, they just go to 20 different people and they say, hey, send me a chapter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=489" target="_blank">00:08:09.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And the 20 different people write a chapter and they send it to you and you compile it together and you publish it and you call yourself the author.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=497" target="_blank">00:08:17.180</a></span> | <span class="t">When really, maybe you wrote the forward, but you really didn't really write the book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=502" target="_blank">00:08:22.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Not here, though. You spent a lot of time interviewing one on one each of these 20 luminaries to get to the questions that you wanted to have answered.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=514" target="_blank">00:08:34.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's talk about that. Why did you decide to go that direction rather than just having people write a chapter?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=519" target="_blank">00:08:39.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I don't think it was ever on my radar, actually, Rick, to have people write the chapters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=525" target="_blank">00:08:45.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Initially, the genesis for this concept came from Harriman House editor Craig Pierce, who I had been talking to for a few years about some type of a book project.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=537" target="_blank">00:08:57.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I thought it would be about retirement bucketed portfolios, which is a topic I write a lot about on Morningstar dot com.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=545" target="_blank">00:09:05.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And I just never could find the time. And so Craig said, well, you know, you do these interviews for your podcast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=552" target="_blank">00:09:12.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I work on a Morningstar podcast called The Long View. He said, you know, you do these interviews, you have some good contacts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=558" target="_blank">00:09:18.180</a></span> | <span class="t">What about a book that was structured in this way where it's a conversation with you and some retirement thought leader?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=565" target="_blank">00:09:25.180</a></span> | <span class="t">He was saying, would that be something that you could squeeze in? And I thought, well, maybe that seems like a little easier lift than writing a big book from scratch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=572" target="_blank">00:09:32.180</a></span> | <span class="t">In hindsight, I had many moments where I was working on this project where I was just like wishing that I was just writing my own book because it would have been easier in a lot of ways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=583" target="_blank">00:09:43.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But the thing I love about this format is that, well, a I think it brings humility into the whole discussion, because I do think it's important to admit that you don't have all the answers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=598" target="_blank">00:09:58.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. You need to look to other people. I'm sure that's why you like doing your podcast to Rick, that you get to tap into people who are absolute experts in their given area.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=609" target="_blank">00:10:09.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So I love that there's just a humility about the project.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=613" target="_blank">00:10:13.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And I also just loved that I could spend time with these people talking deeply about something that they know super well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=621" target="_blank">00:10:21.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So it was a fun project, a little bit of a logistical hassle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=625" target="_blank">00:10:25.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But now that it's done, I'm very happy with it. And I hope that people will find it useful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=629" target="_blank">00:10:29.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I think they will.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=630" target="_blank">00:10:30.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I found it just excellent the way you did it. And I really got a lot out of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=634" target="_blank">00:10:34.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But I want to start right at the beginning. We're going to go through this book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=637" target="_blank">00:10:37.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, there are 20 different interviews, so we're going to spend about two minutes on each each interview.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=642" target="_blank">00:10:42.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's going to be quick. But before you even got into the interviews, you had Jonathan Clements write the forward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=648" target="_blank">00:10:48.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's touching in a way. Could you talk about why you chose Jonathan?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=653" target="_blank">00:10:53.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, Jonathan was top of my list, absolutely, in terms of who would write the forward to the book, mainly because he has been so influential in my own career journey.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=665" target="_blank">00:11:05.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So I remember when I started as an analyst at Morningstar, I'd laugh at this now, but I thought I needed to read the Wall Street Journal basically cover to cover every day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=675" target="_blank">00:11:15.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm reading about corporate earnings news and the, you know, latest management shakeup at McDonald's, whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=682" target="_blank">00:11:22.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I thought I had to read the whole thing. And I remember hitting on Jonathan's column and thinking, OK, there's a lot, you know, as I did this for a while, I realized there's a lot in this paper that's very ephemeral.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=694" target="_blank">00:11:34.180</a></span> | <span class="t">It's really just noise. It doesn't matter at all. But this guy, this Jonathan Clements fellow, seems to really be hitting on the most important things that investors need to know, that people need to know when thinking about their financial lives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=710" target="_blank">00:11:50.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And his column was just so seminal to me in terms of influencing what I wanted to work on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=717" target="_blank">00:11:57.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I realized that I didn't want to be toiling on things that ultimately didn't really matter in people's financial plans.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=725" target="_blank">00:12:05.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I wanted to talk about the stuff that really mattered. His lively writing, just his very clear explanations meant everything to me and were so influential to me in terms of my own career path.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=738" target="_blank">00:12:18.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So he was the logical person to reach out to. This was prior to his cancer diagnosis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=745" target="_blank">00:12:25.180</a></span> | <span class="t">He and I, he said he would be willing to write the foreword. And I did a dance around my kitchen when I got the news and was just so thrilled about that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=753" target="_blank">00:12:33.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, obviously, as Jonathan has has been discussing his diagnosis and, you know, been been very candid about his his thoughts on his prognosis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=764" target="_blank">00:12:44.180</a></span> | <span class="t">It's, you know, obviously been a very bittersweet thing to see him here in the in the foreword.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=770" target="_blank">00:12:50.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But what I will say, Jonathan is a trooper because even though he has the diagnosis, he has been continuing to write some fantastic articles on the Humble Dollar website, his blog.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=783" target="_blank">00:13:03.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, you have to read these if you're, I guess, getting older, if you will, or you should read them anyway, because the things that he's touching on now, I mean, just very good stuff that I haven't read really anywhere.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=799" target="_blank">00:13:19.180</a></span> | <span class="t">The Humble Dollar, Jonathan Clements, if you get a chance to go to a website and read his stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=804" target="_blank">00:13:24.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, it's just just great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=806" target="_blank">00:13:26.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I couldn't agree more. I love that Jonathan is continuing. He's made such a contribution to all of our financial lives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=812" target="_blank">00:13:32.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But I love that he's continuing to do that. He's continuing to take his own life and use it to influence what he what he is working on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=821" target="_blank">00:13:41.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So I love that. I also love to see following him on social media, just how he's visiting with friends.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=828" target="_blank">00:13:48.180</a></span> | <span class="t">There was a recent post from him and Jason Zweig where they had spent some time together. So I'm loving to see that, too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=835" target="_blank">00:13:55.180</a></span> | <span class="t">OK, we've got about two minutes for 20 lessons from 20 different people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=844" target="_blank">00:14:04.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And we're going to start with number one and we're going to go all the way through and then we're going to have a little closing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=848" target="_blank">00:14:08.180</a></span> | <span class="t">What I'm going to do is I'm going to read the lesson and then the person you interviewed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=853" target="_blank">00:14:13.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I'd like you to talk a little bit about that person and why you interviewed them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=856" target="_blank">00:14:16.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the big one or two big takeaways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=859" target="_blank">00:14:19.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Lesson number one, visualize your in retirement lifestyle with Michael Finka.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=866" target="_blank">00:14:26.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So, Michael, I knew had to be in this book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=868" target="_blank">00:14:28.180</a></span> | <span class="t">He is a professor of financial planning, head of the program at the American College of Financial Services and a leading researcher in the retirement planning space.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=878" target="_blank">00:14:38.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But what I love about Michael's work is that he brings a human component to everything he does.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=884" target="_blank">00:14:44.180</a></span> | <span class="t">He thinks about real human beings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=887" target="_blank">00:14:47.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this discussion that we had for the book is about visualizing your in retirement lifestyle, thinking about how you'll change throughout your retirement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=897" target="_blank">00:14:57.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that's one thing that people don't grapple with necessarily.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=902" target="_blank">00:15:02.180</a></span> | <span class="t">You think about your 65 year old self or your 62 year old self, that that's how you'll be 20 years hence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=909" target="_blank">00:15:09.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And Michael's point is, you know, you really need to look into the future because you want to be the one who's making decisions about yourself, about your plans.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=920" target="_blank">00:15:20.180</a></span> | <span class="t">You don't want your kids deciding about your housing in retirement, for example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=925" target="_blank">00:15:25.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So he talks about looking forward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=929" target="_blank">00:15:29.180</a></span> | <span class="t">He talks about cultivating healthy habits with respect to health, physical health, as well as relationships.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=937" target="_blank">00:15:37.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And also talks about the role of work later in life that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=941" target="_blank">00:15:41.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is something that comes up in several chapters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=944" target="_blank">00:15:44.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Just the value of some type of work, maybe paid, maybe unpaid later in life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=950" target="_blank">00:15:50.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I thought it was a good stage setting chapter for the rest of the book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=954" target="_blank">00:15:54.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Very good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=956" target="_blank">00:15:56.180</a></span> | <span class="t">The next lesson is lay the groundwork.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=960" target="_blank">00:16:00.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And here you interviewed Fritz Gilbert.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=964" target="_blank">00:16:04.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So tell us about Fritz and why you chose to interview him and what he had to say.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=969" target="_blank">00:16:09.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, Fritz has a great blog for people who don't know it called the Retirement Manifesto.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=974" target="_blank">00:16:14.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think he's just tremendously clear in terms of enumerating the steps you need to take as retirement comes within, say, five years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=986" target="_blank">00:16:26.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And then as it gets closer, the tasks get more specific down to very granular things like making sure you get stuff off your work computer and making sure that you're saving contacts of people who you want to keep in touch with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1002" target="_blank">00:16:42.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So he's very, very specific about the jobs to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1007" target="_blank">00:16:47.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But the main thing I love about Fritz is that I feel like he's a walking illustration of how to do retirement right in that he started this charity with his wife called Fences for Fido, where they go out on these fence builds for dogs who would otherwise be living on chains.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1023" target="_blank">00:17:03.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is a passion project for them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1027" target="_blank">00:17:07.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But the beauty of it is that they're doing good for the animals and for the families that they're building these fences for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1033" target="_blank">00:17:13.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But they've also just built this great community of other fence builders through this charity, people they get together with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1040" target="_blank">00:17:20.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's also physical activity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1042" target="_blank">00:17:22.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So to me, that ticks a lot of boxes about what you want to be doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1047" target="_blank">00:17:27.180</a></span> | <span class="t">You've got

| <span class="t">And one key finding is that, well, a lot of research has shown that relationships are really everything in life in terms of our happiness, that our interconnectedness with other human beings is just a huge component of whether we're happy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1109" target="_blank">00:18:29.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So the point is to have relationships, but one thing Laura's research team has found is that our networks tend to become a little smaller as

things in this conversation, including the solvency of Social Security, which I think is top of mind, especially for people who are several years from retirement.</span></div><div class="c"><span

how your spending might change by David Blanchett.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1293" target="_blank">00:21:33.180</a></span> | <span class="t">David Blanchett was a researcher at Morningstar for many years, one of my close colleagues.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1298" target="_blank">00:21:38.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Now he is at PGM where he's continuing to do research.</span></div><div

him an email today and he'll respond straight away.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1308" target="_blank">00:21:48.180</a></span> |

target="_blank">00:21:51.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So he's one of the preeminent retirement researchers in the country, in my opinion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1316" target="_blank">00:21:56.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of his greatest research pieces related to an examination of how retirees actually spend over their life cycle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1325" target="_blank">00:22:05.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So this dovetails with what many of us probably have experienced with older adults in our lives or maybe in our own lives,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1332" target="_blank">00:22:12.180</a></span> | <span class="t">We have those go-go years, the slow-go years, and the sometimes called no-go years, the later years of retirement where maybe healthcare expenditures have flared up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1344" target="_blank">00:22:24.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So David identified what has sometimes been called the retirement spending smile.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1349" target="_blank">00:22:29.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And we talked about that and we talked about the implications for retirement

that if you incorporate the fact that spending does tend to trend down for many/most retirees,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1362" target="_blank">00:22:42.180</a></span> | <span class="t">you can spend more in those early years of retirement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1365" target="_blank">00:22:45.180</a></span> | <span class="t">You shouldn't worry about it if you're in good health and it takes you over, say, the 4% guideline in those years before Social Security has come online for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1375"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1430" target="_blank">00:23:50.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So it sort of goes hand in hand with distributing money.</span></div><div

interesting hybrid because his research then is very much grounded in his interactions with his clients.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1447" target="_blank">00:24:07.180</a></span> | <span class="t">He did some research that has been shorthanded as the guardrails approach to retirement spending.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1453" target="_blank">00:24:13.180</a></span> | <span class="t">It's basically a dynamic spending system that puts bands around how low your spending can go in a bad year for your portfolio and how high it can go in a good year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1465" target="_blank">00:24:25.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So we didn't delve so much into the guardrails approach because it can get a little bit complicated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1471" target="_blank">00:24:31.180</a></span> | <span class="t">He takes issue with me saying complicated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1473" target="_blank">00:24:33.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it could be a little complicated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1475" target="_blank">00:24:35.180</a></span> | <span class="t">You need to read the fine print.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1476" target="_blank">00:24:36.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But we did talk about assuming that sort of straight line spending in retirement isn't a great way to go about it because effectively you are building your spending plan for a worst case scenario.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1490" target="_blank">00:24:50.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So his analogy is it's similar to setting out on a road trip and you're only allowed to go one speed for that whole road trip.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1499" target="_blank">00:24:59.180</a></span> | <span class="t">You don't know what road conditions will be like.</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1505" target="_blank">00:25:05.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's what sort of saying, OK, I'm just going to take 4% initially, then inflation adjust that dollar amount thereafter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1512" target="_blank">00:25:12.180</a></span> | <span class="t">That's effectively what you're doing when you use a strategy like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1517" target="_blank">00:25:17.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So Jonathan is an evangelist for people using a more dynamic approach.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1523" target="_blank">00:25:23.180</a></span> | <span class="t">He finds that it very much syncs up with how his clients want to spend.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1528" target="_blank">00:25:28.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And one interesting piece of feedback from him is just that this dynamic spending thing actually syncs up with our behavioral impulses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1537" target="_blank">00:25:37.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So in a bad market, we naturally do want to rein it in.</span></div><div

what's good for your portfolio is also the thing that feels right behaviorally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1550"

that I think are terribly under discussed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1582" target="_blank">00:26:22.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of them is spending.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1584" target="_blank">00:26:24.180</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:26:28.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But his point is, don't just spend like everybody else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1592" target="_blank">00:26:32.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Take a step back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1593" target="_blank">00:26:33.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Think about the activities and the things that actually bring you joy, bring meaning to you, and focus your spending efforts there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1603" target="_blank">00:26:43.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And then if you have things that you don't especially care about for him, it's cars.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1608" target="_blank">00:26:48.180</a></span> | <span class="t">He doesn't care about driving an older car.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1611" target="_blank">00:26:51.180</a></span> | <span class="t">He said, you know, then just pinch pennies mercilessly in those areas.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1616" target="_blank">00:26:56.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And his point is a lot about how, as a culture, there's just a tendency to want to, you know, drive what our neighbors drive, make all the home upgrades that our neighbors make, clothes that our peers wear, all that stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1630" target="_blank">00:27:10.180</a></span> | <span class="t">His point is, take a step back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1631" target="_blank">00:27:11.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And we should do that into retirement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1634" target="_blank">00:27:14.180</a></span> | <span class="t">We should take a look at how we are spending and just make sure that our spending, our planned spending is very much aligned with our personal priorities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1644" target="_blank">00:27:24.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And his point is, if you get funny looks with how you're spending your money, you're probably doing it right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1650" target="_blank">00:27:30.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's get back to the income side of this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1653" target="_blank">00:27:33.180</a></span> | <span class="t">We did talk about Social Security, but the next lesson, which is lesson number eight, is know your retirement income style with Wade Pfau.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1663" target="_blank">00:27:43.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Wade, of course, is a longtime friend of the Bogleheads, has contributed a lot of very important retirement research.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1670" target="_blank">00:27:50.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I wanted to talk to him about this retirement income style awareness matrix that he came up with with one of his colleagues.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1678" target="_blank">00:27:58.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And the basic idea is that we're all wired a little bit differently in terms of our retirement cash flows.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1684" target="_blank">00:28:04.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So some of us might be very geared toward, I just want that paycheck equivalent, something like what I had while I was working.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1692" target="_blank">00:28:12.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Other people may be fine with more variability.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1695" target="_blank">00:28:15.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But his point is that this is really personal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1698" target="_blank">00:28:18.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have in the book a link to a questionnaire that people can take to kind of get their own customized retirement income style analysis where you go through a series of questions and you come out with a sense of, OK, here are the things that I should be focusing my energies on in terms of my retirement portfolio, whether an annuity should be under consideration or I should just put it on the trash heap.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1724" target="_blank">00:28:44.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's, I think, a helpful discussion about the various dimensions of that RISA matrix that Wade has come up with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1732" target="_blank">00:28:52.180</a></span> | <span class="t">The way I think about it is that it's kind of like a style box for investors in retirement, which I think is just sort of a genius complement to our Morningstar style box.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1743" target="_blank">00:29:03.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, Wade has some great ideas.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1744" target="_blank">00:29:04.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I've known him for many years and some wonderful information he puts out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1749" target="_blank">00:29:09.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And his book is about, I don't know, as thick as a phone book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1752" target="_blank">00:29:12.180</a></span> | <span class="t">It is always on my desk, though.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1754" target="_blank">00:29:14.180</a></span> | <span class="t">It's one of my favorites.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1755" target="_blank">00:29:15.180</a></span> | <span class="t">It just is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1756" target="_blank">00:29:16.180</a></span> | <span class="t">If there's anything more comprehensive, I don't know what it is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1759" target="_blank">00:29:19.180</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a go to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1760" target="_blank">00:29:20.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, let's continue to pivot a little bit here and talk more about investing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1764" target="_blank">00:29:24.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And lesson number nine is set an asset allocation for your retirement portfolio with Dr.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1772" target="_blank">00:29:32.180</a></span> | <span class="t">William Bernstein.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1773" target="_blank">00:29:33.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I was lucky to be able to call Bill up and say, hey, would you do this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1778" target="_blank">00:29:38.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we talked about how to construct an in-retirement portfolio.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1782" target="_blank">00:29:42.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Bill, of course, is, I would say, fairly risk averse with respect to inflation, especially making sure that whatever you do, you are hedging against that as a key risk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1794" target="_blank">00:29:54.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So we talked about using treasury inflation-protected securities as kind of the bedrock of that portfolio and then bringing equities into the mix.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1804" target="_blank">00:30:04.180</a></span> | <span class="t">As you know, Rick, since Bill is a mutual friend of ours, he has very strong opinions on certain topics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1810" target="_blank">00:30:10.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So whereas Wade might see more of a gray on topics like annuities, for Bill, there's no gray.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1820" target="_blank">00:30:20.180</a></span> | <span class="t">He does not love annuities at all, but we delved into a lot of different dimensions of constructing an in-retirement portfolio.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1827" target="_blank">00:30:27.180</a></span> | <span class="t">We talked about simplifying the in-retirement portfolio, even using an all-in-one type fund.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1834" target="_blank">00:30:34.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Bill admitted that there are shortcomings, but overall he loves the simplicity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1838" target="_blank">00:30:38.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And then at the end, he talked about how the behavioral aspect of this is just so important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1844" target="_blank">00:30:44.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So in addition to creating a portfolio that passes muster from a mathematical standpoint, you also need to create a portfolio that you can live with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1855" target="_blank">00:30:55.180</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the best portfolio of all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1857" target="_blank">00:30:57.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I recall the first Bill Bernstein book I read 20 years ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

Collins.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1873" target="_blank">00:31:13.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I wanted to talk to J.L. because, A, he has a lot of fans, obviously, among Bogleheads and in circles that I move in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1881" target="_blank">00:31:21.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And his book, A Simple Path to Wealth, has been so influential to so many people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1886" target="_blank">00:31:26.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So I wanted to talk about how one could radically simplify a retirement portfolio if they so chose.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1894" target="_blank">00:31:34.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we talked about using simple index funds as the bedrock of that portfolio.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1900" target="_blank">00:31:40.180</a></span> | <span class="t">In J.L.'s view, just a basic U.S. equity index along with a bond index and maybe a little bit of cash.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1908" target="_blank">00:31:48.180</a></span> | <span class="t">We also talked about some of J.L.'s most controversial work, which relates to homeownership.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1914" target="_blank">00:31:54.180</a></span> | <span class="t">J.L. is not a fan, although he is a homeowner, actually.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1918" target="_blank">00:31:58.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But he thinks that we in the U.S. are a little bit overextended with respect to homes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1925" target="_blank">00:32:05.180</a></span> | <span class="t">and that people are overly defensive about homes as part of kind of wealth building.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1931" target="_blank">00:32:11.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So we discussed that aspect as well, and especially the idea of whether you should carry a mortgage into retirement or not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1940" target="_blank">00:32:20.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so this gets to something that I just want to throw in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1942" target="_blank">00:32:22.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, we all have the philosophy of the Bogleheads, you know, live below your means, try to invest simply, try to use index funds and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1950" target="_blank">00:32:30.180</a></span> | <span class="t">This is like the philosophy that we use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1952" target="_blank">00:32:32.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But the strategy that we all use to get there can be vastly different, even though we may have the same beliefs about how to invest,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1962" target="_blank">00:32:42.180</a></span> | <span class="t">how we actually put our portfolio together and whether we own a house or don't own a house.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1966" target="_blank">00:32:46.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I call that strategy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1967" target="_blank">00:32:47.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And it can be vastly different from person to person.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1969" target="_blank">00:32:49.180</a></span> | <span class="t">It doesn't make mine right and yours wrong or yours right and my wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1973" target="_blank">00:32:53.180</a></span> | <span class="t">It's what's best for us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1975" target="_blank">00:32:55.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that's a lot of what we're getting at.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1977" target="_blank">00:32:57.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Absolutely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1978" target="_blank">00:32:58.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So JL's vision for a retirement portfolio, I would argue, is kind of radically simplified.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1983" target="_blank">00:33:03.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But the point is, as you move into retirement, you should try to reduce the number of moving parts, especially if you're a DIY type.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1991" target="_blank">00:33:11.180</a></span> | <span class="t">You want to be very careful about managing something overly complicated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1995" target="_blank">00:33:15.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So I hope the message gets through from that standpoint.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=1998" target="_blank">00:33:18.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Try to reduce the number of holdings in your portfolio if you possibly can.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=2003" target="_blank">00:33:23.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And you, in Chapter 11, are your own interviewee, I guess.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=2010" target="_blank">00:33:30.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But you did ask Susan to interview you from Morningstar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=2015" target="_blank">00:33:35.180</a></span> | <span class="t">You get to put your own words into this book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=2017" target="_blank">00:33:37.180</a></span> | <span class="t">That's right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=2018" target="_blank">00:33:38.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So I asked my colleague, Susan Jabinski, to interview me for one chapter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=2023" target="_blank">00:33:43.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And the chapter was about retirement portfolio planning and especially this bucket approach that I often work on on Morningstar.com.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=2031" target="_blank">00:33:51.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And the basic idea was influenced by a conversation I had with Harold Davinsky, who's a now retired financial planner.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=2039" target="_blank">00:33:59.180</a></span> | <span class="t">He and I were talking probably 20 years ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=2042" target="_blank">00:34:02.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was asking him what he did with his retired clients to create their cash flows.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=2047" target="_blank">00:34:07.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And his point was, well, I just strip off this cash bucket amounting to a couple of years worth of portfolio withdrawals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=2056" target="_blank">00:34:16.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And having that cash set aside gives my clients a ton of peace of mind with the rest of the portfolio, the long term piece of the portfolio, which will naturally fluctuate a little bit as the years go by.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=2069" target="_blank">00:34:29.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I've been writing and talking about the bucket approach.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=2072" target="_blank">00:34:32.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And it looks deceptively simple when you see these three buckets and you've essentially got a cash bucket, a high quality bond bucket and an equity bucket.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=2082" target="_blank">00:34:42.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But it gets a little bit more complicated when you are talking about how to maintain the buckets on an ongoing basis and also how the logistics work if you have multiple tax silos that you're bringing into retirement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=2096" target="_blank">00:34:56.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So Susan and I discussed some of the finer points of bucketing in this chapter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=2102" target="_blank">00:35:02.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, that's

been one of his beats for us where he talks about housing for older adults, especially.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=2126" target="_blank">00:35:26.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And he and I had just a fabulous conversation about thinking ahead.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=2135" target="_blank">00:35:35.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Think about yourself as you move through retirement and what you may want from your housing as the years go by.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=2143" target="_blank">00:35:43.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So he and I had a great conversation about location, proximity to health care, proximity to people, taxes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=2152" target="_blank">00:35:52.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So financial considerations were certainly part of the discussion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=2155" target="_blank">00:35:55.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But I feel like it's an under discussed component of retirement planning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=2159" target="_blank">00:35:59.180</a></span> | <span class="t">We also discussed reverse mortgages and tapping home equity and other ways in retirement, including to pay for long term care.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=2167" target="_blank">00:36:07.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So it was a tremendously wide ranging discussion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=2171" target="_blank">00:36:11.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I know that I and many Vogelheads tend to not think of housing wealth as really part of our investment portfolio.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=2179" target="_blank">00:36:19.180</a></span> | <span

class="t">So I was happy that Mark and I did discuss the financial dimension of housing in retirement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

target="_blank">00:36:44.180</a></span> | <span class="t">She works on some of Vanguard's financial planning that it provides to its clients and is a CFP.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=2211" target="_blank">00:36:51.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So she's incredibly conversant in many different aspects of retirement planning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=2216" target="_blank">00:36:56.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Retirement decumulation has

a thesis that she wanted to discuss the importance of not getting overly concerned with things that especially as an investor, you have no position to exert any control over.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=2233" target="_blank">00:37:13.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So a lot of the stuff that you might hear about on CNBC, for example, just put that in your too hard pile.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=2239" target="_blank">00:37:19.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And instead, we focused on some things that investors do actually exert control over.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=2245" target="_blank">00:37:25.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So their lifestyles and what they want them to look like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=2248" target="_blank">00:37:28.180</a></span> | <span class="t">She's Vanguard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=2249" target="_blank">00:37:29.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So no doubt we talked about costs, controlling the total costs that you pay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=2254" target="_blank">00:37:34.180</a></span> | <span class="t">We talked about health care costs, having discipline with your plan, lots of different dimensions of control in retirement, which I think can be empowering because there are a lot of aspects about embarking on retirement that do feel uncertain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=2271" target="_blank">00:37:51.180</a></span> | <span class="t">It's really terrific

probably the biggest hurdle I have with the clients is getting over the hump, which they've accumulated all their lives and saved all their lives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

for care,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=2518" target="_blank">00:41:58.180</a></span> | <span class="t">which is an area that

target="_blank">00:43:29.180</a></span> | <span class="t">It means that we are also more likely to need long term care because we often provide care for our partners and they aren't around to care for

need to do is an estate plan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=2785" target="_blank">00:46:25.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So lesson 19, create an estate plan with Jennifer Roselle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=2790" target="_blank">00:46:30.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=2791" target="_blank">00:46:31.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Jennifer Roselle is an estate planning attorney in Indiana.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=2794" target="_blank">00:46:34.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And she's also just a tremendously clear communicator about the why and what of an estate plan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=2802" target="_blank">00:46:42.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I think sometimes people glaze over a little bit when they hear about these different documents that they should have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=2808" target="_blank">00:46:48.180</a></span> | <span class="t">She keeps it very basic, but also I think does inject that real world perspective because she works with clients on this stuff day to day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=2818" target="_blank">00:46:58.180</a></span> | <span class="t">She's dealt with issues like clients with cognitive decline, making sure that kids are taken care of, how to deal with kids who maybe have unequal asset levels, whether you should help the kid who needs it more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=2833" target="_blank">00:47:13.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So she discusses a lot of real world dimensions of estate planning in addition to sharing the basics of some of the documents that you want to be sure to bring into your later years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=2845" target="_blank">00:47:25.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And by the way, you shouldn't wait until retirement to get an estate plan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=2849" target="_blank">00:47:29.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I have one, I have had one for probably 20 years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=2853" target="_blank">00:47:33.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think people should start younger on the estate planning process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=2857" target="_blank">00:47:37.180</a></span> |

target="_blank">00:47:39.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But nonetheless, I think it makes sense to stay ahead of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

I swear it is an incredibly uplifting chapter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=2935" target="_blank">00:48:55.180</a></span> | <span

other thing I love is that he talks about what he calls big P purpose and small P purpose.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=2942" target="_blank">00:49:02.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So big P purpose might be something kind of grandiose that you want to do, like start a foundation or something like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=2950" target="_blank">00:49:10.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But all of us on a day to day basis have small P purposes, things that really give us joy, that bring us closer to our loved ones.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=2959" target="_blank">00:49:19.180</a></span> | <span class="t">His point is that those small P purposes are just as important as the big P purpose stuff, which is a message that I love.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=2966" target="_blank">00:49:26.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I really enjoyed his talk last year and I'm looking forward to it this year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=2970" target="_blank">00:49:30.180</a></span> | <span class="t">OK, closing thoughts or concluding thoughts did all of these interviews.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=2976"

me search project, which I never heard that before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=2986" target="_blank">00:49:46.180</a></span> |

class="t">So what did you get out of the book?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=2990" target="_blank">00:49:50.180</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:49:55.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know if he came up with it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=2997" target="_blank">00:49:57.180</a></span> | <span class="t">He used the term me search and I was like, oh, my gosh, that's genius.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=3000" target="_blank">00:50:00.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And that is exactly what I'm working on here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=3002" target="_blank">00:50:02.180</a></span> | <span class="t">A couple of key takeaways, Rick.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=3005" target="_blank">00:50:05.180</a></span> | <span class="t">One is just the value of I'm just a big believer in staying busy and not busy for the sake of being busy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=3013" target="_blank">00:50:13.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But just continuing to try to make an impact for me is something that even if, you know, I retire from paid work at some point, if and when I do that, I still just want to make an impact.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=3025" target="_blank">00:50:25.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I still want to fill my days with doing things that are making the world a little bit better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=3032" target="_blank">00:50:32.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And that sounds cheesy, but I would say the book project very much reinforced my goal to do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=3038" target="_blank">00:50:38.180</a></span> | <span class="t">The whole idea of being adaptive and I cannot put myself in the shoes of my 85 year old self, but really trying to think ahead, not be stubborn about life changes as they might come at me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=3054" target="_blank">00:50:54.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to listen to loved ones.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=3056" target="_blank">00:50:56.180</a></span> | <span class="t">If they're telling me I should do something, I am not just going to put my head down and keep doing what I'm doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=3062" target="_blank">00:51:02.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I really do want to try to listen to the people around me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=3065" target="_blank">00:51:05.180</a></span> | <span class="t">A key takeaway I would have for Bogle heads is just the importance of not overly obsessing about the money piece.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=3073" target="_blank">00:51:13.180</a></span> | <span class="t">If you are a Bogle head, I'm guessing the money piece will probably be just fine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=3078" target="_blank">00:51:18.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Instead, spend as much time on the relationship piece, the purpose piece, those things will ultimately be even more impactful in terms of whether your retirement is a success.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=3093" target="_blank">00:51:33.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So I would say obsess about those things just as much as you do about the financials.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=3098" target="_blank">00:51:38.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I'd like to tell you about a conversation I had with Jonathan Clements because it hits directly at what you said a little bit earlier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=3105" target="_blank">00:51:45.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I was sitting across the table from him having we're having dinner at a Bogle heads

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=3119" target="_blank">00:51:59.180</a></span> | <span class="t">He was doing it as a nonprofit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

expenses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=3124" target="_blank">00:52:04.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I asked him, I said, Jonathan, I mean, you don't need to work anymore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4-jNDnjxEE&t=3128" target="_blank">00:52:08.180</a></span>
