But I kind of want to just talk</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=31" target="_blank">00:00:31.140</a></span> | <span class="t">to you about something a bit more than just models themselves, even more than demos. I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=37" target="_blank">00:00:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of just want to talk to you about curiosity. There's a famous French mathematician, Poincaré,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=43" target="_blank">00:00:43.300</a></span> | <span class="t">he said, at the moment when I put my foot on the step, the idea came to me. He was working</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=48" target="_blank">00:00:48.420</a></span> | <span class="t">on this really, really esoteric field of mathematics called fusion functions. And he was stuck on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=53" target="_blank">00:00:53.480</a></span> | <span class="t">this problem for weeks at a time. He didn't really know how to make any progress at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=57" target="_blank">00:00:57.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And he was boarding a bus one day. And suddenly, it kind of just all came to him. He went from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=62" target="_blank">00:01:02.700</a></span> | <span class="t">not knowing at all to having a full understanding of the problem. He said something along the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=66" target="_blank">00:01:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">lines of, the role of this unconscious work in mathematical invention appears to me as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=71" target="_blank">00:01:11.900</a></span> | <span class="t">incontestable. I'm going to make one main argument to you guys today. And that's going to be that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=78" target="_blank">00:01:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">curiosity is the main force for how we pull ideas from the future into the present. And when we have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=85" target="_blank">00:01:25.300</a></span> | <span class="t">these subconscious patterns that our brains recognize, they kind of surface as a feeling. And this feeling</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=90" target="_blank">00:01:30.980</a></span> | <span class="t">is what we know as curiosity. So I'm going to present you with a few demos I've worked on over the years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=97" target="_blank">00:01:37.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And they've each followed a specific pattern, where initially, I had this really great idea. I thought it was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.720</a></span> | <span class="t">fantastic that it was going to change everything. And then you kind of get to implementing the specific</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.860</a></span> | <span class="t">idea. And you realize it's actually not possible at all. And then like, through sheer effort and like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.080</a></span> | <span class="t">determination, you somehow find a way to make things work, even though you're working with models that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=117" target="_blank">00:01:57.140</a></span> | <span class="t">have maybe a context length of like 2000 tokens. And then once you get to work, and you feel this like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.620</a></span> | <span class="t">really good sense of pride and joy, and I think the most important thing about good demos is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.740</a></span> | <span class="t">they're kind of a way of exploring what's possible with these models. I'm, I kind of see these models as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.260</a></span> | <span class="t">not necessarily things you can kind of understand fully without interacting with them. And I think the way you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.020</a></span> | <span class="t">can best interact with them is by making really, really interesting demos. And the way you make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.900</a></span> | <span class="t">interesting demos is just by following your curiosity. So this is from 2020. This was when GPT-3 was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.020</a></span> | <span class="t">released. This was pretty mind-blowing for me. And I was surprised no one was really talking about this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.940</a></span> | <span class="t">GPT-3, for those of you who remember, had a context length of 2000 tokens. It cost, I think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.780</a></span> | <span class="t">$75 per million output tokens. And yeah, you had to get specific permissions from OpenAI before you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.980</a></span> | <span class="t">shared anything about the model. You couldn't ship a chat app because that violated the terms of service,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.620</a></span> | <span class="t">but it was a really magical time. It felt like you had this new tool in this like, in this toolkit of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.940</a></span> | <span class="t">computing, and you could do so many things with it. And I think what was really important about this demo is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.940</a></span> | <span class="t">that it inspired people that you could actually do things with software.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think the way you get really impressive ideas is actually not by doing anything special.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.140</a></span> | <span class="t">I think each person has their own unique kind of context window, the things you've seen and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.780</a></span> | <span class="t">experienced. And I just so happened to watch a talk by Brett Victor before making this where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.580</a></span> | <span class="t">he came up with this principle that creators need an immediate feedback with what they're creating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was really tired of copying and pasting code into my editor and then compiling it and then like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.580</a></span> | <span class="t">running it and see what would happen. So I decided to just put like a JSX compiler in the browser,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.540</a></span> | <span class="t">and it just felt different. It felt kind of magical in a way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And now today, like Claude's system prompt is 25,000 tokens, which is kind of funny.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's another similar demo. This one's a bit more interactive. So you can kind of describe what you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.220</a></span> | <span class="t">want. And then because the context windows were so small, it couldn't actually generate the entire</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.100</a></span> | <span class="t">application in a single prompt. You actually had to do three parallel prompts and then join them in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.660</a></span> | <span class="t">background. This is really simple, just asking for a Google homepage. And then it generates three</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.220</a></span> | <span class="t">different components for it. But yeah, this is just, I think, one of the ways you can express your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.700</a></span> | <span class="t">curiosity. You kind of look at the world around you and what you've experienced. And you kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.660</a></span> | <span class="t">synthesize new ideas. And you get this subconscious feeling pulling you in a direction. And I think the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.540</a></span> | <span class="t">demo is the best way to kind of express that feeling to the world. Here's another more interesting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.700</a></span> | <span class="t">one. This was 2021. I think the context lengths now expanded from 2,000 tokens to about 4,000 tokens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So we could do a bit more with this. I was kind of curious if these models had any sense of agency.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So I decided to give it a really simple objective of buying me AirPods in Chrome. And if you were to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.940</a></span> | <span class="t">just dump a web page into the browser, into the context window, it just wouldn't work. Like the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Walmart.com shopping page would be like 24,000 tokens. It's just impossible. So I was actually a bit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.780</a></span> | <span class="t">frustrated that I couldn't get it to work for a few days. So I wrote a custom HTML parser that would parse a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.220</a></span> | <span class="t">web page into its core essence, which was able to fit it into the tiny context window of GPT-3 in 2021.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.900</a></span> | <span class="t">It definitely failed spectacularly. It got distracted with the terms of service.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.900</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think it was more so just interesting that we discovered that these models pre-trained on web</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.980</a></span> | <span class="t">text had this sense of agency kind of internal in their weights. We kind of take that for granted now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.260</a></span> | <span class="t">but 2021 was a very different time. Here's a more recent demo from a friend of mine, Farza. He's using</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=338" target="_blank">00:05:38.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Gemini 2.5 Pro here today. So we're still discovering new capabilities. Here he's making a basketball</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.780</a></span> | <span class="t">shot tracker where he's just putting in a video of him playing basketball, asking it to provide feedback</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=348" target="_blank">00:05:48.660</a></span> | <span class="t">as if Michael Jordan was watching his gameplay. And I think this is a really great demo because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.820</a></span> | <span class="t">it inspires people to realize that you can actually make video-first experiences with Gemini 2.5 Pro.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Before this, it was kind of like, oh, you can have it watch your screen and it'll give you feedback on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.540</a></span> | <span class="t">your code. But there's so much more we can do. And I think one of the main reasons I find demos really,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.820</a></span> | <span class="t">really interesting is that they inspire possibility. So much so that there's probably so much low-hanging</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=375" target="_blank">00:06:15.220</a></span> | <span class="t">fruit today in these models that if you were to halt all capabilities, if you kept all the weights</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=379" target="_blank">00:06:19.540</a></span> | <span class="t">frozen, didn't do a single backpropagation, I think you could build really amazing products for the next 10</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.260</a></span> | <span class="t">years, keeping everything constant. And I think the way you do that is just by building these demos and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.420</a></span> | <span class="t">following your curiosity. So I have this really famous quote by Richard Hamming where he says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=396" target="_blank">00:06:36.900</a></span> | <span class="t">"In science, if you know what you're doing, you should not be doing it. Engineering,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=399" target="_blank">00:06:39.940</a></span> | <span class="t">if you know what you're doing, you should not be doing it." So traditional engineering is very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=404" target="_blank">00:06:44.180</a></span> | <span class="t">teleological. It's very goal-oriented, very purpose-driven.

We didn't have an -- we didn't have an instruct model until about a year</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=862" target="_blank">00:14:22.660</a></span> | <span class="t">later. So what -- it was essentially similar to base models we have today, where you give it a prefix and it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=867" target="_blank">00:14:27.460</a></span> | <span class="t">just completes it. So you prompt engineer it with a few examples, and that's usually good enough.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=872" target="_blank">00:14:32.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Any other demos you've got there?

A large part of it came from a sense of frustration that we have these really powerful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=954" target="_blank">00:15:54.580</a></span> | <span class="t">models today, and no one really knows what they're capable of doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=958" target="_blank">00:15:58.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think I examined it a bit further, and it did feel like a sense of moral obligation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=963" target="_blank">00:16:03.460</a></span> | <span class="t">You have these pioneers of computing from the 60s and 70s and 80s, like Licklider and Alan Kay and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=969" target="_blank">00:16:09.700</a></span> | <span class="t">whatnot.

But really, I think if you look back at, like, what people were writing about in the 60s</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=990" target="_blank">00:16:30.900</a></span> | <span class="t">and 70s, there's a whole goldmine of ideas there that we can revisit and actually make possible today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=996" target="_blank">00:16:36.180</a></span> | <span class="t">In the man-machine symbiosis paper, Licklider talks about an assistant that knows everything you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=1002" target="_blank">00:16:42.980</a></span> | <span class="t">working on and has, like, perfect context and can help you with anything immediately.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=1007" target="_blank">00:16:47.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And here we have, like, ChatGPT, where every time you want to talk to it, you press "New Chat," and it has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=1012" target="_blank">00:16:52.260</a></span> | <span class="t">no memory of what you've talked about beforehand, minus, like, a few basic facts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=1015" target="_blank">00:16:55.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think it's really just -- it really boils down to wanting to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=1019" target="_blank">00:16:59.700</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of do the ideas that these pioneers came up with justice beforehand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=1030" target="_blank">00:17:10.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=1030" target="_blank">00:17:10.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Three minutes, so did you have something loaded up?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=1034" target="_blank">00:17:14.980</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm looking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=1035" target="_blank">00:17:15.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, this was an old GPT-3 demo where the idea was, how do you get these models to solve very large</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=1043" target="_blank">00:17:23.540</a></span> | <span class="t">and ambitious problems?

So you can give it some really ambitious problem, like, how do you solve climate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=1062" target="_blank">00:17:42.740</a></span> | <span class="t">change?

Yeah, I think one of the core ideas behind this was, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=1077" target="_blank">00:17:57.460</a></span> | <span class="t">these models are a lot more than just text completion models, but I think they can be useful as, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F8mnGPUycY&t=1082" target="_blank">00:18:02.340</a></span> | <span class="t">very helpful reasoning assistance, specifically at solving big problems.
