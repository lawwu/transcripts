I think it's also important to make sure you're carving out one-on-one time for each other if you have a partner, because it's really valuable for your kids to see that being a huge priority. And I think it also helps parents go at raising children in more of a unified way.</p><p>Yeah, I think we regularly do date nights. And when our children say, "No, don't leave, don't leave." We say, "It's important for mommy and daddy to have some time together too, just like you get to go on dates with mommy and daddy. And just like we have mommy and daddy play days, we need to spend time together." And I think I often hear some parents two, three, four years into having children that say, "Gosh, we haven't taken a date yet." And so we'll talk about childcare a little bit later, but I think it's really important.</p><p>And I'm glad we've made time for that.</p></div></div></body></html>
