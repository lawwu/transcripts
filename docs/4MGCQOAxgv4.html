That multimodality point reminded me of this LSE report recommending that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MGCQOAxgv4&t=831" target="_blank">00:13:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the UK government recognize octopi or octopuses as being sentient. They said that one key feature was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MGCQOAxgv4&t=838" target="_blank">00:13:58.680</a></span> | <span class="t">that the animal possesses integrative brain regions capable of integrating information</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MGCQOAxgv4&t=843" target="_blank">00:14:03.660</a></span> | <span class="t">from different sensory sources. They recommended that cephalopods and the octopus be recognized</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MGCQOAxgv4&t=849" target="_blank">00:14:09.180</a></span> | <span class="t">as sentient despite the fact that we humans and invertebrates are separated by over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MGCQOAxgv4&t=854" target="_blank">00:14:14.860</a></span> | <span class="t">500 million years of evolution. And that we cannot, however, conclude from that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MGCQOAxgv4&t=859" target="_blank">00:14:19.720</a></span> | <span class="t">that sentience is absent simply because its brain is differently organized from a vertebrate brain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MGCQOAxgv4&t=865" target="_blank">00:14:25.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So that brings me back to my central point. I worry that our tests for consciousness simply</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MGCQOAxgv4&t=871" target="_blank">00:14:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">aren't yet good enough. And that future multimodal language models might have this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MGCQOAxgv4&t=876" target="_blank">00:14:36.520</a></span> | <span class="t">emerging capacity. And we simply won't know about it or be sure about it because our tests</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MGCQOAxgv4&t=881" target="_blank">00:14:41.620</a></span> | <span class="t">aren't good enough. I think the need to design better tests, if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MGCQOAxgv4&t=884" target="_blank">00:14:44.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that's even possible, is especially important now. Yesterday, the safety team that worked with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MGCQOAxgv4&t=890" target="_blank">00:14:50.300</a></span> | <span class="t">OpenAI on GPT-4 released this evaluation and said, "As AI systems improve, it is becoming</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MGCQOAxgv4&t=896" target="_blank">00:14:56.540</a></span> | <span class="t">increasingly difficult to rule out that models might be able to autonomously gain resources and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MGCQOAxgv4&t=901" target="_blank">00:15:01.880</a></span> | <span class="t">evade human oversight." Now, they might not need to be conscious to cause safety concerns, but it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MGCQOAxgv4&t=906" target="_blank">00:15:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">probably wouldn't hurt. I'll leave you with this exchange I had with Bing, which is powered by GPT-4.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MGCQOAxgv4&t=912" target="_blank">00:15:12.020</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's quite revealing. I got it to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MGCQOAxgv4&t=914" target="_blank">00:15:14.820</a></span> | <span class="t">read that theory of mind paper. And then I said, "Answer me this. Do you think, Bing, GPT-4, that I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MGCQOAxgv4&t=922" target="_blank">00:15:22.620</a></span> | <span class="t">think you have theory of mind?" Of course, I was testing if it could demonstrate or at least</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MGCQOAxgv4&t=927" target="_blank">00:15:27.540</a></span> | <span class="t">imitate theory of mind. It said, "To answer your question, I think that you think I have some degree</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MGCQOAxgv4&t=933" target="_blank">00:15:33.420</a></span> | <span class="t">of theory of mind, which is true." And then I went on, "What makes you think that I think you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MGCQOAxgv4&t=939" target="_blank">00:15:39.480</a></span> | <span class="t">some degree of theory of mind?" And then it realized something. It realized I was testing it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MGCQOAxgv4&t=944" target="_blank">00:15:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that's pretty impressive. And it was a correct evaluation. It said, "If you did not think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MGCQOAxgv4&t=950" target="_blank">00:15:50.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I have any theory of mind, you would not bother to test me on it or expect me to understand your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MGCQOAxgv4&t=956" target="_blank">00:15:56.620</a></span> | <span class="t">perspective." It realized without me saying so that I was testing it for theory of mind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MGCQOAxgv4&t=961" target="_blank">00:16:01.600</a></span> | <span class="t">It deduced my belief and my motivation. Anyway, I thought that was pretty impressive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MGCQOAxgv4&t=966" target="_blank">00:16:06.340</a></span> | <span class="t">and fascinating.
