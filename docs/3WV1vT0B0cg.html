<span class="t">And so over the past, I'm a company six years old,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=108" target="_blank">00:01:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">but over the past two years, in particular,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

target="_blank">00:02:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I sell a very horizontal AI tooling, and this is important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So enterprises are adopting vertical solutions.</span></div><div class="c"><span

happening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think for the true

analogy that I use is that if, in the 2000s,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.640</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:02:43.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and were just buying Salesforce or products like that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">verticalized products like that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">then the tech industry would just not be as big.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Companies like Snowflake and Databricks and Datadog</span></div><div

they do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I really think that the values ultimately unlocks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.080</a></span> | <span class="t">once enterprises feel comfortable to actually build with AI themselves</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">as opposed to just buy verticalized tooling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's talk about the journey.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the journey that they go through.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.080</a></span> | <span class="t">They all start with open AI and anthropic enterprises.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.640</a></span> | <span class="t">They're like us for good reasons.</span></div><div

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just they do it differently from the rest of us in that they have their own</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.560</a></span> | <span class="t">dedicated deployments of these models on Azure or AWS</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.560</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:03:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And then they get their engineers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">A lot of times they're more predictive ML teams to become AI teams and build on top of these.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And they're happy with that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And if they can continue doing that, they will.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">because there's just a lot of inertia in sticking to that if it actually works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Sticking to closed models, it's so easy to use, API-based, build on top of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.440</a></span> | <span

<span class="t">And so let me tell you what I've seen going back in time and how that's changed over time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So in 2023, I remember going and trying to sell to enterprises and the terms toying around came up quite a bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And I heard this actually literally from the CIO of a massive insurance company back then.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It was like, yeah, we put a dedicated deployment of open AI of GPT-4 or GPT-3</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.680</a></span> | <span class="t">so that our engineers can toy around with it.</span></div><div class="c"><span

cute.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.320</a></span> | <span class="t">That started to change.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.400</a></span> | <span class="t">In 2024, we saw actual production use cases, again, built on top of these closed models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I would say like 40, 50 out of the 100 had something in production in that year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And then in 2025, this year, something changed and is palpable, at least from where I'm sitting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And the change is that there are cracks in that assumption.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.480</a></span> | <span

of them now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=333" target="_blank">00:05:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, you can go with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google has been coming up pretty well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.920</a></span> | <span class="t">They're somewhat interoperable at a certain level.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, they all use OpenAI specs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=341"

<span class="t">It's because when I ask them, they say, look, the price per token is plummeting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And we just talked about this, like, right before this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's -- they were saying that problem will just take care of itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=370" target="_blank">00:06:10.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Compliance, privacy, security, also not problems because these frontier model companies kind of take care of that with the help of the CSPs, with the help of the cloud providers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So, that these models are running in a dedicated way inside of their existing VPCs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=387" target="_blank">00:06:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">If these aren't the cracks in that assumption of just use closed models, then what are the cracks?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=393" target="_blank">00:06:33.160</a></span> | <span class="t">These are the reasons that I have seen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'll go through them one by one and go through, like, examples of these as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And then at the end, also talk about, you know, if these are the cracks, then...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.280</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, how do you get around them?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=412" target="_blank">00:06:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, there be the dragons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=414" target="_blank">00:06:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So, one is around quality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=417" target="_blank">00:06:57.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Look, none of these enterprises are in any sort of misconception that they can build the next GPT-4 better than OpenAI can.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=424" target="_blank">00:07:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">That's just not the reality, not as a general model, at least.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=428" target="_blank">00:07:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But for specific use cases, for specific tasks, we are seeing this where the frontier models are not necessarily the right tool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=436" target="_blank">00:07:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So, the example, I've seen this in a couple of big health plans, is that they want to do medical document extraction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=444" target="_blank">00:07:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So, they have millions of medical documents, you know, prior auths and medical claims.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=450" target="_blank">00:07:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And they're trying to get, you know, CPT, like, procedure codes and diagnosis codes and prescriptions, and just giving that to, you know, Claude or GPT doesn't do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=461" target="_blank">00:07:41.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But they have the data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=463" target="_blank">00:07:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Over the years, they've collected a lot of labeled data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=465" target="_blank">00:07:45.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And they're like, oh, we can do better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=467" target="_blank">00:07:47.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, that's -- and they actually did.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=470" target="_blank">00:07:50.280</a></span> | <span class="t">That's one example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=472" target="_blank">00:07:52.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Another example is on the voice side, in particular on the transcription side, like, again, staying in the healthcare space, like, understanding medical jargon or, like, you know, getting transcription models to understand medical jargon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=485" target="_blank">00:08:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">That has been another reason to not just use an API-based generic model, but in-house it and do better than what they can do with just API-based models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=497" target="_blank">00:08:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Another one is around latency.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=499" target="_blank">00:08:19.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Look, these models, OpenAI, Anthropic, even, you know, the big players that serve open source models behind shared APIs, inherently, they're optimized for high throughput and high QPS at the expense of latency.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=516" target="_blank">00:08:36.840</a></span> | <span class="t">But a lot of times, we're seeing more and more now where latency is becoming very critical, especially when, you know, the AI voices or AI phone calls.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=527" target="_blank">00:08:47.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Latency starts really mattering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=529" target="_blank">00:08:49.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Time to first token, time to first sentence really starts mattering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=533" target="_blank">00:08:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And you have to just think about things differently.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=538" target="_blank">00:08:58.040</a></span> | <span class="t">You can't just use the frontier models as is because, again, they're optimized for something else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=545" target="_blank">00:09:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Around the unit economics, there's -- again, like I said before, like pricing, they said this will take care of itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=554" target="_blank">00:09:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Then came this year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=555" target="_blank">00:09:15.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And as you saw in the previous talk from Michael, the Deagentic use cases ballooned.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=560" target="_blank">00:09:20.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And when they balloon, it's crazy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=563" target="_blank">00:09:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, I've seen this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=564" target="_blank">00:09:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, every single user action can result in literally 50 inference calls.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=568" target="_blank">00:09:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, suddenly, the thing that you thought is going to take care of itself is not taking care of itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=573" target="_blank">00:09:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That costs are really ballooning, and enterprises think that maybe they can do better on the cost and unit economics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=582" target="_blank">00:09:42.280</a></span> | <span class="t">In order to show ROI, in order to show that the solutions that they're pushing are economically viable, they need to show -- they need to reduce their costs somehow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=592" target="_blank">00:09:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And they're realizing that they can actually run these models and pay for the compute and have that be a lot cheaper than paying per token and covering all the margins of someone else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=600" target="_blank">00:10:00.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And really going from being a price taker to actually be the maker of the price and be in control of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=607" target="_blank">00:10:07.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, lastly, Destiny, this one is a bit vibey, but I'm hearing it more recently, that some CIOs, CTOs saying, if we, the enterprise, use just the frontier models, and so do our competitors, what is our advantage?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=625" target="_blank">00:10:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">What is our alpha?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=626" target="_blank">00:10:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And maybe we should bring in some of these things in-house, and to be able to even differentiate, not just at the workflow and application level, but also at the AI level.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=637" target="_blank">00:10:37.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So, now what?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=639" target="_blank">00:10:39.320</a></span> | <span class="t">If those are the reasons why they want to adopt open source models and iterate on those and build those and fine tune those and distill those, then what changes?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=648" target="_blank">00:10:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, what changes is that they go from super simple world that just call an API and run with it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=654" target="_blank">00:10:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">to now you need to build inference, you need to build inference infra, you need to make sure that it scales well, you need to make sure that you can move fast,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=662" target="_blank">00:11:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">that your engineers can actually deliver instead of having to hire a bunch of new types of people and then wait for them for a long time to actually build this infrastructure in-house.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=675" target="_blank">00:11:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So, one thing that I hear quite a bit at this point is, look, I hear this from enterprises, I hear this from startups, too, actually,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=683" target="_blank">00:11:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">which is that, look, you know, we've picked a model, an open source model, we've heard of VLM or SGLANG or TRTLM, we have some GPUs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=692" target="_blank">00:11:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">in the case of enterprises, it's in the data center, in the case of startups, it's in some cloud, and you put these together and you get production inference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=699" target="_blank">00:11:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And I know for a fact that this is not true.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=703" target="_blank">00:11:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I wish it was true, but I know for a fact that this is not, that there's a lot more that goes into making inference, especially mission critical inference work well inside of your company.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=717" target="_blank">00:11:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So, what are those?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=718" target="_blank">00:11:58.720</a></span> | <span class="t">These are the dragons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=720" target="_blank">00:12:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">These are the dragons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=722" target="_blank">00:12:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So, one, at the performance layer, you know, we talked about, you know, situations where things are very latency sensitive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=731" target="_blank">00:12:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">The way that you optimize models for latency is actually quite involved, both at the model level and at the infrastructure level.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=742" target="_blank">00:12:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You have to do it, you have to attack it at both levels.</span></div><div

it's like, hey, do you use speculative decoding?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=750" target="_blank">00:12:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And if so, do you, which route do you go?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=753" target="_blank">00:12:33.280</a></span> |

so, as an enterprise, can you hire the right folks to be able to be on top of the research?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=775" target="_blank">00:12:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Because you don't, these are not just, you know, switches that you flip in SGLang or VLM and get the result.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=781" target="_blank">00:13:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Some of these optimizations bleed out of the model level into the infrastructure level.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=787" target="_blank">00:13:07.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So, as an example, if you want to be able to do prefix caching really well, if you want to be able to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=795" target="_blank">00:13:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">disaggregate a serving really well, because that starts really mattering, especially in agentic use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=802" target="_blank">00:13:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">cases where, like, the prompts are massive, but the prompts are somewhat similar from one to the other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=807" target="_blank">00:13:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">It ends up mattering a lot in you hitting your time to first token and you hitting your P99 of that in a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=815" target="_blank">00:13:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">reliable way. Another thing on the infrastructure is, especially if it's the mission critical inference,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=822" target="_blank">00:13:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">which more and more I see that that's the case, how do you guarantee four nines?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=826" target="_blank">00:13:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And with this, this formula does not guarantee you, you know, more than two nines. And I saw this firsthand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=836" target="_blank">00:13:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So, how do you make sure that when the hardware fails underneath that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=841" target="_blank">00:14:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">you actually recover? How do you make sure that, you know, when VLM crashes, which happens often -- I saw</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=846" target="_blank">00:14:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">this firsthand with, like, when Triton crashes often, your tail latencies go through the roof</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=850" target="_blank">00:14:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">while you wait for these things to come back. And during that time, like, your users are feeling that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=860" target="_blank">00:14:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">how do you build against those and make sure that, you know, you can still guarantee four nines and not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=866" target="_blank">00:14:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">be super over-provisioned and mess up all the unit economics that we talked about. When a big burst of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=872" target="_blank">00:14:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">traffic comes in, how do you make sure they scale up fast? How do you make sure that, you know, I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=877" target="_blank">00:14:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">talking to this massive enterprise, like, soft drink example, where they're like, yeah, it takes us eight</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=883" target="_blank">00:14:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">minutes. When you want to bring up a new replica of the same model, it takes eight minutes. And I believe that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=888" target="_blank">00:14:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">because that -- if you add up all the different things that it goes into doing that, that is how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=891" target="_blank">00:14:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">long it takes. But that's not okay. Again, your tail latencies go through the roof as soon as there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=895" target="_blank">00:14:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">a big spike of traffic. How do you account for that? And then there are other things around, again, like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=901" target="_blank">00:15:01.600</a></span> | <span class="t">making sure that your engineers move fast. The tooling, life cycle management. The observability, massive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=908" target="_blank">00:15:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">iceberg, which is like -- it's like, oh, yeah, I just put some logs and metrics, and you realize there's a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=915" target="_blank">00:15:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">more to do underneath it. We just -- previous talk Michael talked about. And then lots of stuff around</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=921" target="_blank">00:15:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">controls and audits and things that enterprises actually care about. So these are the dragons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=929" target="_blank">00:15:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">These are the dragons. And these are the times that then enterprises have a decision to make. Like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=933" target="_blank">00:15:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">once they get to this level, either, like, I tell them or -- and they have to believe me -- or they don't,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=940" target="_blank">00:15:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and they go and build it. And then they see some of these things, that they have a decision, which is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=945" target="_blank">00:15:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">build or buy. And that's my job to then try to convince them that I think they should buy this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=951" target="_blank">00:15:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">layer of infrastructure and platform as opposed to build it. And that's sometimes harder than it seems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=962" target="_blank">00:16:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm happy to talk more about these things. So I'll be at our booth. Like, two topics that I'd</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=967" target="_blank">00:16:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">love to talk about if you're interested. One, self-servingly, if you're an enterprise and those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=972" target="_blank">00:16:12.720</a></span> | <span class="t">problems resonate, I'd love to chat with you about. And two, less self-servingly, if you're a startup and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=978" target="_blank">00:16:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you're trying to sell to enterprises, I'm happy to chat about all the right decisions that we made, the wrong</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=984" target="_blank">00:16:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">decisions that we made along the way to build something that then, when it comes to selling to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=989" target="_blank">00:16:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">enterprises, when it comes to deploying it into their own clouds, that it's actually possible and not a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=996" target="_blank">00:16:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">massive other set of dragons over there.

We'd love to see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV1vT0B0cg&t=1002" target="_blank">00:16:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you there.
