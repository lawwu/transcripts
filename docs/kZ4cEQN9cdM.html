And the family is fighting like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ4cEQN9cdM&t=1399" target="_blank">00:23:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">crazy." Can you imagine? What would you do? What would you think about that? Just open-ended,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ4cEQN9cdM&t=1407" target="_blank">00:23:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">see what they say. Also bringing up things like, "Oh, my friend's dad recently passed away.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ4cEQN9cdM&t=1414" target="_blank">00:23:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">He had been remarried.

I think anytime someone's seeking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ4cEQN9cdM&t=2075" target="_blank">00:34:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">financial advice, I am a big, big, big fan of fiduciary-bound financial advice and certified</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ4cEQN9cdM&t=2080" target="_blank">00:34:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">financial planners offer that. The other big thing is that so often we conflate, "I have a financial</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ4cEQN9cdM&t=2088" target="_blank">00:34:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">advisor, they're managing my money."

So I know that many of our parents have a financial advisor managing their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ4cEQN9cdM&t=2108" target="_blank">00:35:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">money. And so presenting it not as, "You should talk to another person, but maybe you should get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ4cEQN9cdM&t=2114" target="_blank">00:35:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">a financial plan, which might be a service that your financial advisor doesn't provide. Let's get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ4cEQN9cdM&t=2120" target="_blank">00:35:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">a fiduciary to come in and make a one-time plan," is something. And then the other thing that just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ4cEQN9cdM&t=2125" target="_blank">00:35:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">came to mind as we were talking is, if you look at the expected return of a lot of investment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ4cEQN9cdM&t=2130" target="_blank">00:35:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">portfolios, when you're young, they're really heavily weighted with the stock market, which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ4cEQN9cdM&t=2135" target="_blank">00:35:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">has a higher expected return. As you get older, you reduce the risk of that portfolio, which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ4cEQN9cdM&t=2140" target="_blank">00:35:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">inherently reduces the expected return. So that if your parents have had a financial advisor for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ4cEQN9cdM&t=2146" target="_blank">00:35:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">many years, paying them 1%, with an expectation of earning 7%, it's one-seventh of their portfolio is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ4cEQN9cdM&t=2153" target="_blank">00:35:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">going to fees. But if now as they're getting older and older, that's coming down to maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ4cEQN9cdM&t=2157" target="_blank">00:35:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">they're in such a low-risk portfolio that they're expecting 3% or 4%.

So I think as you reduce the risk of your portfolio,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ4cEQN9cdM&t=2170" target="_blank">00:36:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">fees can come into play as an important factor.

So again, I kind of think of pre-nups in a very similar way,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ4cEQN9cdM&t=3444" target="_blank">00:57:24.480</a></span> | <span class="t">that it is an insurance policy on my marriage.

Three days sooner because there were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ4cEQN9cdM&t=4539" target="_blank">01:15:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">multiple restaurants that he had recommended that had gone up like 48 hours prior and were already</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ4cEQN9cdM&t=4546" target="_blank">01:15:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">sold out for the dates that we were going to be in Japan. Some of them just book that fast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ4cEQN9cdM&t=4550" target="_blank">01:15:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you listen and you're planning a trip, truly calendar reminder for like 45 days out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ4cEQN9cdM&t=4556" target="_blank">01:15:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to start planning to make some of the dinner reservations. So that was my only bummer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ4cEQN9cdM&t=4561" target="_blank">01:16:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">It was so helpful for strategizing my itinerary. As I mentioned earlier, I lived in Japan as a kid.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ4cEQN9cdM&t=4570" target="_blank">01:16:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So first of all, our itinerary was a little different than some people's might have been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ4cEQN9cdM&t=4574" target="_blank">01:16:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">because I lived in Kobe. So we wanted to spend a good chunk of time in Kobe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ4cEQN9cdM&t=4578" target="_blank">01:16:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">People kind of overlook Kobe as a city. So my first tip would also be like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ4cEQN9cdM&t=4581" target="_blank">01:16:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">don't overlook it. It's a great city. Also Kobe beef, go get it in the motherland.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ4cEQN9cdM&t=4587" target="_blank">01:16:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">The other part, I was really struggling about when to stay in a ryokan, which is a traditional</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ4cEQN9cdM&t=4593" target="_blank">01:16:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Japanese hotel.

I want my husband to be able</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ4cEQN9cdM&t=4597" target="_blank">01:16:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">to experience the onsen. And there's a point in the podcast where he says that a lot of people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ4cEQN9cdM&t=4602" target="_blank">01:16:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">try to shoehorn that into Kyoto. And that is always the wrong move. Because Kyoto, you want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ4cEQN9cdM&t=4607" target="_blank">01:16:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">to be like out experiencing it, going to all the temples, going to the wonderful food. There's so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ4cEQN9cdM&t=4611" target="_blank">01:16:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">much to do there. But that's antithetical to what a ryokan is because you want to be relaxing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ4cEQN9cdM&t=4617" target="_blank">01:16:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">in the hotel, doing the onsen. So that really should be the dessert as he described it of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ4cEQN9cdM&t=4623" target="_blank">01:17:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">trip. We didn't quite do it as dessert. It was like third course, almost dessert,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ4cEQN9cdM&t=4628" target="_blank">01:17:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">but it was at a point where we had done a lot of the things. And so it was great to be relaxing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ4cEQN9cdM&t=4633" target="_blank">01:17:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And we actually did a little outside of Kobe in Arima, which is just again, A-R-I-M-A, Arima,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ4cEQN9cdM&t=4640" target="_blank">01:17:20.560</a></span> | <span class="t">wonderful town that I would highly recommend.
