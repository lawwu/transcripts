So there's a new government agency that's going to regulate fast food,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc-Leuq0G7o&t=841" target="_blank">00:14:01.080</a></span> | <span class="t">fast food, the fast food industry, you know, they're not going to stop a minimum wage, it's gonna be work conditions. So now you're turning fast food restaurants into a highly regulated part of the economy. And the weird thing is, it's not even just all fast food, it's basically chains that have more than 100 fast food restaurants nationally. So in other words, if you're a local operator of two McDonald's, you'd be subject to this 10 person board. But if you own 20</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc-Leuq0G7o&t=870" target="_blank">00:14:30.420</a></span> | <span class="t">restaurants that aren't part of a national chain in California, then you're not. And so the weird thing is that some workers in the fast food industry could get this new minimum wage of $22, where other or as other workers who work for, you know, they're not part of a major chain would get the statewide minimum wage at 15. So it's, it's, it's kind of unfair in that some parts of the restaurant industry are being regulated and others aren't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc-Leuq0G7o&t=895" target="_blank">00:14:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Is there any justification here that you can think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc-Leuq0G7o&t=899" target="_blank">00:14:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">of to not let the free market do its thing, Friedberg?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc-Leuq0G7o&t=902" target="_blank">00:15:02.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, if you represent the workers, you're saying, Hey, pay him $22.
