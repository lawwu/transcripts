to a holy calling because of His own purpose and grace, which He gave us before the ages began.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXMHUVqkvs&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So grace is planned before there was any sin, so God knows there's going to be sin that needs grace.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXMHUVqkvs&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And Revelation 13, 8, "All of them will worship the beast whose names are not written before the foundation of the world in the book of the life of the Lamb who was slain."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXMHUVqkvs&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's a book before the foundation of the world in which names are being written, and the name of the book is the life of the Lamb who was slain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXMHUVqkvs&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So God planned before the foundation of the world that there would be a Lamb who was slain for sinners.</span></div><div class="c"><span

down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXMHUVqkvs&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So God knows it all, and He means to do it all, do redemption, do history, according to Ephesians 1, 6, in pursuit of the display of the glory of His grace.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXMHUVqkvs&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the goal of creation and redemption, the communication of the glory, of the grace of God for the everlasting enjoyment of His people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXMHUVqkvs&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So His glory and our joy are the united purpose of God in creation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXMHUVqkvs&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the question that was asked is, "Why would God move forward with this plan in view of the millions of people who will not be saved but suffer eternal conscious torment?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXMHUVqkvs&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And Leah is right to ask it this way because hell is real and terrible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXMHUVqkvs&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And Jesus taught that it was real, and the apostles taught that it was real.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXMHUVqkvs&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">A little glimpse would be Revelation 14, 11, where John writes of the devil and his angels and those who do not believe will be in hell, the lake of fire.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXMHUVqkvs&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever, and they have no rest day or night.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXMHUVqkvs&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it is torment, and it is endless, and it is day and night.</span></div><div

think comes closest to answering Leah's question is Romans 9, 22 to 23, and it goes like this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXMHUVqkvs&t=329" target="_blank">00:05:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"What if God, desiring to show His wrath and to make known His power, has endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXMHUVqkvs&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And here's the key explanatory purpose clause.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXMHUVqkvs&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He does that. He endures vessels of wrath in order to make known the riches of His glory for vessels of mercy which He prepared beforehand for glory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXMHUVqkvs&t=356" target="_blank">00:05:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if I understand this passage, Paul is saying, and this is the key sentence, "God endured for a season the unbelief and rebellion of those who reject Him so that His wrath and power would be justly displayed in their punishment,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXMHUVqkvs&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">so that those who do believe will see the glory of His grace more fully in relation to the justice of His wrath."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXMHUVqkvs&t=386" target="_blank">00:06:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If she pursues the question further, which I think she is, why would God move forward with this plan to communicate His grace at such a cost?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXMHUVqkvs&t=399" target="_blank">00:06:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The only thing I know to say, Leah, is we must trust God's infinite wisdom in this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zXMHUVqkvs&t=407" target="_blank">00:06:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He has done all things well.
