And then I recognized, well, how much do I need to really be able to do the thing I wanna do and have freedom? And it was way less than I expected. And it really came down to three categories, which is living, food, savings.</p><p>And for me, it was $3,000. And when I was at my day job, I was like, well, if I can get the side hustle to that number, then I can quit. And I never encouraged people to actually go take a risky thing. It seemed risky to quit your job to try to hopefully start a business.</p><p>It's not what I want people to do. And when you realize how much smaller that number is than you expect, you realize it's also more attainable. And so I've twice quit jobs and then gone on once I hit my $3,000 freedom number.</p></div></div></body></html>
