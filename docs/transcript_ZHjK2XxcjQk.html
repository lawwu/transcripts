Let's see here. That's two questions. We're on to number three. All right, sir, what do we got for number three? Okay, next question. We have a question about New Year's resolutions. I know it's a couple months past then, but he's got some good points here and he talks about going back to his guiding documents. So be interested to hear what you think about that. Hey, Cal, this is Matt. I'm a private wealth advisor in Texas. Really enjoy the podcast. I'm on your fourth book right now. And I have a question. Given that it's the start of a new year, how would you recommend to someone who is, let's just say, relatively new to time block planning and to some of your ideas, how would you recommend they go about tackling New Year's resolutions in conjunction with coming up with the guiding document for their personal life and also for their professional lives? And then how they would then work through goals related to the four or five Cs, then distill those down into quarterly plans. And then how frequently should one be checking these kind of overarching guiding documents and annual plans so that they can feel like they are staying true to these overarching principles and goals, but being able to action them on a quarterly basis and then down into a weekly basis? Thanks so much. I really appreciate it. So Matt, I'm going to try to simplify some of what you're talking about here. And so maybe that'll help. I'm going to reduce the number of documents. I'm gonna try to reduce friction here a little bit. So at the core of all of this is my multi-scale time management strategy. And again, for people who are new to my strategy, watch the time management core ideas video on my YouTube channel. So that's youtube.com/calnewportmedia. Go to the core ideas playlist, play the video on time management, and I get into this in detail. But when I'm talking about my time management system, there's this one part where I say you should be doing multi-scale planning, which is daily, weekly, quarterly planning. So let's start with that. So each day, your time block plan your day. When you build that time block plan, you're referencing your weekly plan that you write at the front of each week, which helps you figure out what you should be doing that day. When you write that weekly plan each week, you are checking out your quarterly plan, which is aiming you towards your bigger picture initiatives or any types of habits or heuristics or strategies that you're running during that quarter. And then you update that quarterly plan every quarter. I'm going to suggest that these different planning documents you're talking about that exist above this scale, these annual plans, these guiding documents that for the most part for now, Matt, integrate them into your quarterly plan. So you can have a quarterly plan for your work and a quarterly plan for your life outside of work, just have at the top of the plan. And if you're using something like Google Docs or some such, put it in like a box frame, like a one cell table to differentiate it. I think visual matters. And you have this sort of bigger picture plan right there at the top of your quarterly plan documents. So you know what, you see it just every quarter when you work on your quarterly plan, you see that annual plan, like what you're working on that year, what's important to you. And when you build your plan for that quarter, it's based on that. And then you just see it and you don't have to worry about it's not a separate document. So when it comes to something like New Year's resolutions, that's just going to go into naturally those bigger picture plans, that bigger picture annual picture. So you're just going to see that every single week when you build your weekly plan. And then when you update your quarterly plan every quarter, you might seriously rejigger that annual plan. That's how I would suggest to simplify things, Matt. So you just have those quarterly planning documents that influence weekly, influence daily, that's much simpler. And that's the way I largely describe it in that time management video. The one guiding document though, that you probably do want to keep separate is a values document is a much more timeless. These are the values by which I run my life. I like to have that as a separate document. And I would suggest you review that every week. So when you do your weekly plan, I just think it should be more precious. And if you want to print it and put it in like a laminated folder type thing, so you have a physical copy you can take out and look at. I think that's not a bad idea. And that's just good. I do it on Fridays at the end of the week. Just remind yourself what you're all about. I think that's important and that's important to be in its own document, but annual plans, any type of guiding plans that persist on a scale beyond the quarter, throw them at the top of the quarterly plan. Yes, they're not going to change much from quarter to quarter, but you're going to see them a lot and it's going to sear in. So that's what I'd recommend. And so your new year's resolutions just exist in that ecosystem. It's nothing special. You don't have to do something special for it. It's just a tweak to your annual plan, gets reflected in the quarterly plans, gets reflected in your weekly plans, gets reflected in your time block plans, gets reflected in what you're doing right now in this very moment. It all links together.</p></div></div></body></html>
