We're going to explore what is new in Python 3.10.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=6" target="_blank">00:00:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">There are a few different things I want to cover there. We have some more additions to typing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=12" target="_blank">00:00:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">which I think are pretty cool. The parenthesized context manager, which is kind of an interesting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=19" target="_blank">00:00:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">update because it's not really an update, so we'll get into that pretty soon. We have structural</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=26" target="_blank">00:00:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">pattern matching, which I've covered before, and we're just going to run through it really quickly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=30" target="_blank">00:00:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">in this video. And then there is also a load of new error messages, which are pretty interesting,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=37" target="_blank">00:00:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">actually. There's some really good ones in there. So we'll go through all of those new features</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=43" target="_blank">00:00:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">in Python 3.10. Okay, so in the last few iterations of Python, there's been a steady</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=50" target="_blank">00:00:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">improvement of the Python's type hinting or type annotations capabilities. And with Python 3.10,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=59" target="_blank">00:00:59.200</a></span> | <span class="t">we are seeing more of that again. Now, there's a few changes or a few updates and features with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=66" target="_blank">00:01:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">the typing in Python 3.10, but I think the most interesting one is the addition of a new operator.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=74" target="_blank">00:01:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is what we used to have to do in Python 3.9 and before. So in here, I'm just defining</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.720</a></span> | <span class="t">really simple function that adds two integers or floats together. Now, if we want to define x and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">y as being potentially an integer data type or a float data type, then we would have to use this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">union operator, which we would import from typing up here. Now, with Python 3.10, we don't have to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">do that anymore. It's much simpler. All we do is include the pipe character here, which is our new</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">union operator, which obviously it looks a lot cleaner. So that's the main new feature with type</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">annotations in 3.10. So let's move on to the new parenthesize context manager. Okay. So what we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=129" target="_blank">00:02:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">talking about when we talk about context managers is exactly what you can see on the screen now. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">we have, this is the most common example of a context manager in Python. And this is just how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">we read in our files. So we have with, so this is setting up our context. And here we are assigning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">this stream here as F. Okay. And then within this indented area, we can read F, but outside of it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">we can't. So we couldn't write something like text equals F dot read, because in this case,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">F just doesn't exist outside of that context. So that's what we mean by context manager.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, if we wanted to open multiple context managers within the same area,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">we could write something like this. So we'd have with open and we have another open afterwards,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">and then we would be able to access both of those within this indented area.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">The only problem is that we would have to keep all of this on the same line</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">due to limitations with Python's previous parser. Now, the parser got updated in Python 3.9,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">which is why I say this is kind of not really a new update, but it is a new update.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So before then, we had to keep everything on a single line. And we can get around that a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">bit by adding the line continuation character, and this would work as well. But the problem with this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.600</a></span> | <span class="t">is that it's not technically Pythonic, which I mean, for most people, it doesn't really matter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">But now what has been added, thanks to the new Python parser, which introduced in 3.9,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.120</a></span> | <span class="t">is we can include parenthesized context managers. So we can add these inside brackets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And that will now work. And this is officially a new feature for Python 3.10.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But we can actually switch back to Python 3.9. And if I run this again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">we see that it still works. So that's kind of weird, right? Now, the reason for that is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the parser, the new parser introduced in 3.9, allows this syntax to work. But it was not added</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">as a genuine new feature until Python 3.10. Now, why that has been done, I really can't tell you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">because I don't understand. But that is just how it is. Now, if we take this back one version</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">further to 3.8, we see that we do actually get the invalid syntax. So this is a new feature,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=302" target="_blank">00:05:02.560</a></span> | <span class="t">but it's also not a new feature. So yeah, that's a strange one. Now, the next one, which I think is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">probably the most hyped new feature of 3.10, and with good reason, it is very cool, is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">structural pattern matching. Now, we can write this statement here. And this is just a simple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">example. We're going to move on to a real example in a moment. This is an if-else statement. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">we're just checking this code. We can run that without a problem. And some new syntax has been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">added in Python 3.10. And that is the match case statement. So this is the equivalent of what we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=345" target="_blank">00:05:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">did up here, but using the new match case syntax, which, OK, that's interesting. It's cool. But it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.720</a></span> | <span class="t">doesn't really bring us anything new. We could just do that with a if-else statement before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=357" target="_blank">00:05:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's not particularly interesting. But what is interesting is the structural pattern matching</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=364" target="_blank">00:06:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">part of this new syntax, which allows us to do this match case comparison. But rather than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=372" target="_blank">00:06:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">specifying whether that HTTP code is an exact match to whatever values are in those case statements,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=379" target="_blank">00:06:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">we can check the structure of a object and check if it matches a pattern which we pass</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=386" target="_blank">00:06:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">through the case statement, which is very, very cool. Now let's see how that works. So if I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">remove these two, I'm going to define a dictionary here. So dictionary A and dictionary B. Now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">these two both contain similar information, but they're in a different structure. So that means</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">that we would have to access both of these using different paths. Now, what we can do is create a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=416" target="_blank">00:06:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">pattern that matches both of these and add them both within a match case statement. And we can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">use that to check which pattern we have and perform a different operation on each one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=429" target="_blank">00:07:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So to do that, first, so this is our code. We're going through in a loop through dictionary A,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=437" target="_blank">00:07:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">dictionary B, and I've just added this string called test that shouldn't match to anything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=442" target="_blank">00:07:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">because it's just a string. Okay. So looping through each of those, and we're going to test</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=446" target="_blank">00:07:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the match case on each one. So first, so we're matching here and then we have our case. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=452" target="_blank">00:07:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">here is our pattern. So this is a pattern we want to match. Now, if we compare that pattern,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=458" target="_blank">00:07:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">we'll see that we have ID and meta, ID and meta, and inside meta, we have another dictionary,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=465" target="_blank">00:07:45.920</a></span> | <span class="t">which contains source and location. And here we have source and location as well. Now this doesn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=471" target="_blank">00:07:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">need to be perfect match, by the way, we could, this would also match if I got rid of location</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=476" target="_blank">00:07:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">like that. And obviously we'd have to go to loc here as well. So it doesn't have to be a perfect</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=484" target="_blank">00:08:04.640</a></span> | <span class="t">match, just as long as whatever you have entered does fit into the structure that we are comparing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=491" target="_blank">00:08:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">against. Now that's the first one, but that will not match to this because we don't have the meta</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=498" target="_blank">00:08:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">key and the meta does not contain no dictionary. Okay. And in dict B, but it does match this one,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=506" target="_blank">00:08:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">which is ID source and location. Same as this one here. So that will match. And then here we have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=515" target="_blank">00:08:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">our catch all statement. So this is like our else statement, and this will just catch any items that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=523" target="_blank">00:08:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">do not match either of those cases, e.g. our test at the end there. So let's run that and see what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=528" target="_blank">00:08:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">it prints. Okay. So we see that we get the first one. So it manages to extract, ident, source and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=536" target="_blank">00:08:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">loc, and print those all out. And then for the second one, it does the same, even though they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=540" target="_blank">00:09:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">a different structure because it matches to this different case. And then here we have our catch</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=545" target="_blank">00:09:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">all and we print out no match. So this, I think easily is the coolest feature in 3.10. And I've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=554" target="_blank">00:09:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">already found it useful for processing data in a similar way to what I'm showing here. So it's,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=559" target="_blank">00:09:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">in my opinion, super cool and something to be excited for. So let's move on to our final new</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=569" target="_blank">00:09:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">feature, which are the new and improved error messages. Okay. So let's move on to the new error</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=576" target="_blank">00:09:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">message in 3.10. So they've done quite a few new messages here that are just a lot easier to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=585" target="_blank">00:09:45.600</a></span> | <span class="t">understand. So for example, if we take this unclosed dictionary in 3.9, we get this unexpected</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=595" target="_blank">00:09:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">EOF while parsing. EOF means end of file. So this basically is telling us that the parser has gone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=603" target="_blank">00:10:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">all the way to the end of the file and it hasn't found the closing bracket of our dictionary.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=607" target="_blank">00:10:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And okay, fair enough. Once you've been using Python for a while, you know what it means,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=612" target="_blank">00:10:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that's fine. But this isn't particularly clear, especially if you're new to Python. I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=618" target="_blank">00:10:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm certain that the first time I got this error, and I'm certain that almost everyone,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=623" target="_blank">00:10:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">the first time I got this error, will have had to Google what this means. Now in Python 3.10,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=632" target="_blank">00:10:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">now it's really simple. It's telling us that our dictionary was never closed,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=637" target="_blank">00:10:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">which is much better. Now in the same sort of area, we also have unclosed strings where we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=643" target="_blank">00:10:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">get this EOL, which is end of line. And that means the same thing again, saying we've got to the end</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=650" target="_blank">00:10:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">of the line and your string isn't closed. Now in Python 3.10, rather than that, we get this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=657" target="_blank">00:10:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">untermated string literal, and that's just so much easier to understand. Another one is assignment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=666" target="_blank">00:11:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">versus comparisons. So obviously here we should have a double equal sign because we're comparing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=672" target="_blank">00:11:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">we're not making two equal to three. So if we run that, we just get invalid syntax. Now for us,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=680" target="_blank">00:11:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">obviously we know what's going on there, but maybe if you're new to the language,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=684" target="_blank">00:11:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">it might not be so clear. So now what we get is cannot assign to a literal here. Maybe you meant</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=692" target="_blank">00:11:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">double equal sign, not a single equal sign. So a lot clearer again. Now another area that I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=701" target="_blank">00:11:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">is pretty interesting, although I can't seem to get it working at the moment, is where we enter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=707" target="_blank">00:11:47.520</a></span> | <span class="t">a incorrect attribute name. So usually we get this attribute error, and that is essentially what we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=713" target="_blank">00:11:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">will also get over here in Python 3.10. But as well as this, although we don't see it here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=720" target="_blank">00:12:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">we should also get a suggested attribute name based on whichever attribute has the closest match.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=730" target="_blank">00:12:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Now I'm not sure why it doesn't work here, but if we take a look here on the actual What's New</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=737" target="_blank">00:12:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Python page, we can see that this should give us a recommendation of do you mean named tuple,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=745" target="_blank">00:12:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">which I think is pretty cool. And we should also get the same with named errors as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=752" target="_blank">00:12:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So if we have this new variable on the left, we'll see that we get this name error. New VR</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=760" target="_blank">00:12:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">is not defined because we have a typo. It's fine. And then in Python 3.10, what we should find</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=768" target="_blank">00:12:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">is that this will also recommend, hey, this isn't quite right. Maybe you meant new VR. And we can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=777" target="_blank">00:12:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">see this in this example here on the What's New page. So overall, I think those new error measures</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=786" target="_blank">00:13:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">are definitely a lot clearer. And they're probably going to help a lot of people. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=791" target="_blank">00:13:11.120</a></span> | <span class="t">that's really good to see. Okay, so that's everything for this video.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-A435hIYio&t=796" target="_blank">00:13:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I hope it's been useful. And I will see you in the next one.</span></div></div></body></html>
