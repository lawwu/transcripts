This video is a Judo training session with Travis Stevens from a while back. He's a 2016 Olympic silver medalist in Judo and one of the greatest American Jidoka ever. I've trained Judo and Jiu-Jitsu for many years and took some time off on the Judo side, focusing more on submission grappling than throwing.</p><p>But I'm hoping to get back into it with Jimmy Pedro, the legendary Judo coach out in Boston. I love Judo too much. I miss it. Big thank you to Craig Jones and the B Team for letting us use their gym for this Judo session and I should also say that Austin in general is amazing for martial arts.</p><p>We've got 10th Planet with Gabe Tuttle, New Wave with John Donahart, Gordon Ryan, Nicholas Maragalli and others, B Team with Craig Jones, Nicky Rod, Nicky Ryan and others, and many more. I highly recommend you check out these places and who knows, maybe you'll see me there and we'll get a chance to train.</p><p>And now, dear friends, here's the 2016 Olympic silver medalist in Judo, Travis Stevens. I've been a fan of yours for a long time. Thank you for talking a little Judo with me today, man. Spread the knowledge. Here we go. I'm going to make you go up and then I'm going to go under and then put you on your back right where you're standing.</p><p>That's the idea. But I actually don't have to do much lifting, so when I come down and I split, I hold tight, I get a strong pull, and when I back up, now you're right where you were standing. The fundamental movement here is the splitting either the hips or you're doing like some leg to the outside.</p><p>You always just got really good at doing this step and generating power from it where when I kick, I press it hard enough where I'm not overextending this leg and this moves. What a lot of people try to do is they go here and they overcommit and obviously can't take that step.</p><p>I try to hike and let that slide into place naturally. It's important that the angle is here instead of straight on unless you're going to get me to turn and give you that angle. It's very difficult for you if you take a grip here on the side and then you were to try to come in and split my legs right there.</p><p>You see how I can start to slide and there's a gap on this side. A lot of times when I do this, people slip off to this side and you end up missing it. If I change your angle to here, now come in. See how you got my hip and so you're not worried about coming around because the second I try to lift and jump over, that leg will be sliding back and that's going to if I try to step over, my weight's going up.</p><p>When you back up, you're going to amplify that. This is a dream come true by the way. You're known for this interesting variation, which is the Seinagi throw where you grab the lapel. Can you explain how that works? In a basic sense, you're going to take a grip here.</p><p>Don't get pushed, like resist there and then this happens. I get that back and forth push so that it's effortless on my front leg so that there. See how you can actually get pulled through when I slip the pressure. That's the basics of it. Now I have to get you to a point where you can't sprawl and lower your center of gravity.</p><p>What I do for that is when I lower that weight and I lift that weight, I hold it. That way when you pop up on your toes, the hand at the top of the arc holds you while I slip underneath and then I can catch you on my hips.</p><p>So I've got to get there before you get lower than I do. And then you're doing this big. Yes, so typically if I find my point at the center, my foot starts there and then I replace and I slip and then we come back up. If you're gripping and I'm holding your hand, which sometimes I do, if I press you at some point, see how I'm getting you to stand up?</p><p>That leg is light. Now I can come back through. Yes, but I press them until they press back hard enough where we go from this angle to up and then I can slide on the legs. And let's say like, right, I can't attack because this leg is in front.</p><p>I also, if you have a good stable position, I can't necessarily move that foot, but you're off balance point is here at the front and there at the rear. So if I take my pinky and I hit that point, you're going to turn and face me. Thank you. Now it's not in front anymore.</p><p>So I didn't, I never had to move it. So when you're in this position, go ahead and move off of that and then knock me to that front position, wait, the second you see me starting to rotate, add to that. Yeah. Yeah. There we go. There you go. And then I don't feel the weight.</p><p>Thank you, brother.</p></div></div></body></html>
