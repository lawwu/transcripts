And he can do that, Becky. Here's the second story. Just this week, I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_islJhGB2xM&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">talking to a PhD in theology, asking to tell me his life story, and he told me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_islJhGB2xM&t=517" target="_blank">00:08:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">that he grew up in a Christian home, and when he studied in the university, he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_islJhGB2xM&t=521" target="_blank">00:08:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">threw it all away. He became a relativist, a postmodern, no truth, and lived like it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_islJhGB2xM&t=529" target="_blank">00:08:49.640</a></span> | <span class="t">for five years. And then he read, for whatever gracious reason, who knows, God</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_islJhGB2xM&t=538" target="_blank">00:08:58.440</a></span> | <span class="t">put him on to reading a book about the resurrection, and God persuaded him,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_islJhGB2xM&t=544" target="_blank">00:09:04.440</a></span> | <span class="t">"Jesus really is raised from the dead. I can't escape this, and if Christ is raised</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_islJhGB2xM&t=550" target="_blank">00:09:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">from the dead, everything changes." And it did for him. And I said, "How do you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_islJhGB2xM&t=556" target="_blank">00:09:16.760</a></span> | <span class="t">account for that?" And he got huge tears in his eyes. I had no idea he was gonna</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_islJhGB2xM&t=562" target="_blank">00:09:22.760</a></span> | <span class="t">tear up in this conversation. Didn't seem like the person who would do that. And he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_islJhGB2xM&t=568" target="_blank">00:09:28.200</a></span> | <span class="t">had no explanation except sheer intervention of divine grace. And the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_islJhGB2xM&t=575" target="_blank">00:09:35.400</a></span> | <span class="t">last story, quickly. In 1982, when I was two years into the pastorate, I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_islJhGB2xM&t=581" target="_blank">00:09:41.960</a></span> | <span class="t">reading in Leadership magazine, and there was an article there, it's become iconic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_islJhGB2xM&t=587" target="_blank">00:09:47.520</a></span> | <span class="t">for many people. It was called "The War Within," and it was about bondage to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_islJhGB2xM&t=593" target="_blank">00:09:53.020</a></span> | <span class="t">sexual sin by a pastor, and how for ten years he was an absolute hypocrite. He</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_islJhGB2xM&t=600" target="_blank">00:10:00.460</a></span> | <span class="t">would go to speak at spiritual retreats, and between sessions he would steal away</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_islJhGB2xM&t=609" target="_blank">00:10:09.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and actually go to strip clubs. That's how serious the bondage was. And the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_islJhGB2xM&t=616" target="_blank">00:10:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">article was about how he read a novel, and God used a novel about good and evil</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_islJhGB2xM&t=624" target="_blank">00:10:24.520</a></span> | <span class="t">to open him up to the desire for purity like he'd never known, and this is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_islJhGB2xM&t=629" target="_blank">00:10:29.980</a></span> | <span class="t">one sentence I remember, and maybe this will give some encouragement. He wrote</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_islJhGB2xM&t=634" target="_blank">00:10:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">this, "I cannot tell you why a prayer that has been prayed for ten years is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_islJhGB2xM&t=643" target="_blank">00:10:43.800</a></span> | <span class="t">answered on the one thousandth request when God has met it for the first nine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_islJhGB2xM&t=652" target="_blank">00:10:52.520</a></span> | <span class="t">hundred and ninety-nine with silence." And so Becky, you can read that article. I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_islJhGB2xM&t=660" target="_blank">00:11:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">mean, it's a male-oriented article, but I just googled it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_islJhGB2xM&t=664" target="_blank">00:11:04.760</a></span> | <span class="t">"Leadership, War Within, Lust," and there it came up. Becky, God may surprise you. I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_islJhGB2xM&t=674" target="_blank">00:11:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">praying that he will surprise you stunningly that a prayer you've prayed a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_islJhGB2xM&t=680" target="_blank">00:11:20.120</a></span> | <span class="t">thousand times will be answered on the one thousand and first time. I don't know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_islJhGB2xM&t=689" target="_blank">00:11:29.420</a></span> | <span class="t">why he has delayed, Becky. I don't have an answer for your question about why does</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_islJhGB2xM&t=694" target="_blank">00:11:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">God stay far away. I don't know why God's timing is the way it is. I just know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_islJhGB2xM&t=703" target="_blank">00:11:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you're not the first. You're not alone, and Jesus in fact told you a parable to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_islJhGB2xM&t=710" target="_blank">00:11:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the effect—this is Luke 18, 1—he told them a parable to the effect that they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_islJhGB2xM&t=716" target="_blank">00:11:56.520</a></span> | <span class="t">ought always to pray and not lose heart. So Becky, don't give up. Your answer may</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_islJhGB2xM&t=725" target="_blank">00:12:05.320</a></span> | <span class="t">be just over the horizon.
