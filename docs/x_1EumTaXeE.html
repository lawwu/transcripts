that will hire you okay cool but you know it's a it's not it's not easy but one of the things that we've done in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

it started and then what issues were there after it ran so at least you can prevent the AI system from creating more errors without you even if it doesn't work in a perfectly clean code base</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_1EumTaXeE&t=592" target="_blank">00:09:52.520</a></span> | <span class="t">okay third testing so why should you write tests at all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_1EumTaXeE&t=599" target="_blank">00:09:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I think I was pretty lazy as a developer for a long time and did not want to write tests because it took a you know a lot of effort you have to maintain them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_1EumTaXeE&t=607" target="_blank">00:10:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">okay I already wrote the code it works okay but one of the major objections to writing tests has kind of disappeared now that we have AI systems the ability to generate tests is now so easy that you might as well write tests especially if you have correct code</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_1EumTaXeE&t=622" target="_blank">00:10:22.200</a></span> | <span class="t">you can tell the agent hey just write a bunch of tests throughout the ones that don't pass and just keep the rest so there's no real reason to not write tests at all and be echo as they say at Google if you liked it you should have put a test on it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_1EumTaXeE&t=636" target="_blank">00:10:36.200</a></span> | <span class="t">this becomes much more important with coding agents the reason is that you don't want your coding agent to go change the behavior of your system in a way that you don't understand and don't expect and don't want to see happen</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_1EumTaXeE&t=647" target="_blank">00:10:47.040</a></span> | <span class="t">so at Google this matters a lot for their infrastructure because they don't want your site to crash when someone changes something but if you really care about the behavior of your system you want to make sure that it's fully tested</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_1EumTaXeE&t=657" target="_blank">00:10:57.880</a></span> | <span class="t">so how do we actually write good tests I'll go through a bunch of different components to this so first one of the things that you can do is write code in a functional style</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_1EumTaXeE&t=668" target="_blank">00:11:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">by this I mean code that has no side effects this makes it much much easier to run LLMs and understand if the code is actually successful you really don't want to be running a test that has access to say your live Gmail environment where if you make a single mistake you can delete all of your email you really want to isolate those types of side effects and be able to focus most of the code on the kind of functional transformations that matter for your program</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_1EumTaXeE&t=695" target="_blank">00:11:35.720</a></span> | <span class="t">second you can try and write two different types of unit tests happy path unit tests are those that are ones that show you that your code is working it's happy hooray it worked you don't need that many of those you just need a small number to show that things are working as you hope the unhappy unit tests are the ones that help us find bugs and here LLMs can be really really helpful so especially if you've written your code in a functional style</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_1EumTaXeE&t=722" target="_blank">00:12:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">you can have the LLM generate hundreds or even thousands of potential inputs see what happens to those inputs and then ask the LLM does that look weird and often when it says yes that will be a bug</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_1EumTaXeE&t=734" target="_blank">00:12:14.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and so now you have a perfect test case replicating a bug third after you've written your unit tests it's maybe a good idea to throw them away in some cases this is a little bit counterintuitive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_1EumTaXeE&t=746" target="_blank">00:12:26.720</a></span> | <span class="t">in the past it spent we took all this effort and spent all this time trying to write good unit tests and so we feel some aversion to throwing away but now that it's so easy to run LLMs and generate the test suite</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_1EumTaXeE&t=758" target="_blank">00:12:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">again from scratch there's a reason a good reason to not keep around too many unit tests of behavior you don't care about too much you might also want to just refactor the ones that you generated into something that's slightly more maintainable</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_1EumTaXeE&t=770" target="_blank">00:12:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">but when you do keep them around it does kind of confuse the LLM when you come back and change this behavior so it's something that's at least worth thinking about whether you want to keep the test that were originally generated clean them up how many of them should you keep etc</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_1EumTaXeE&t=782" target="_blank">00:13:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">fourth you should probably focus on integration tests as opposed to testing only the kind of code level functional behavior of your program integration tests are those that show you that your program actually works like from the user's perspective</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_1EumTaXeE&t=797" target="_blank">00:13:17.720</a></span> | <span class="t">like when the user clicks on this thing does this other thing happen AI systems can be extremely good at writing these especially if you create nice test plans where you can write okay when the user clicks on the button to add the item to the shopping cart</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_1EumTaXeE&t=811" target="_blank">00:13:31.720</a></span> | <span class="t">then the item is in the shopping cart if you write that out and then you write the test then you can write another test plan like if the user clicks to remove the button the thing from the shopping cart then it is gone that systems can almost always get this right and so it allows you to work at the level of meaning for your testing which can be much more efficient</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_1EumTaXeE&t=830" target="_blank">00:13:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">fifth you want to think about test coverage as a core part of your testing suite so if you're having cloud code write things for you then you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_1EumTaXeE&t=840" target="_blank">00:14:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">you don't care just about the tests working on their own but you also care are there enough tests in the first place</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_1EumTaXeE&t=847" target="_blank">00:14:07.720</a></span> | <span class="t">if you think back to the original screenshot where we get back our PR of you know how many lines have changed if I tell you how many lines have changed it's not that helpful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_1EumTaXeE&t=855" target="_blank">00:14:15.720</a></span> | <span class="t">if I tell you so many lines have changed and also there's a hundred percent test coverage and also all the test paths and also a thing looked at the test and thought they were reasonable now you can probably click on that merge button without quite as much fear</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_1EumTaXeE&t=868" target="_blank">00:14:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and sixth we try to make it easy to run tests and sandboxes and without secrets as much as possible this makes it a lot easier to actually fix things and makes it a lot easier to make sure that you're not accidentally causing problems or making flaky tests</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_1EumTaXeE&t=883" target="_blank">00:14:43.720</a></span> | <span class="t">The third thing that we can do to detect errors is ask an LLM there are many different things that we can check for including if there are issues before you commit with your current change if the thing that you're trying to do even makes sense if there are issues in the current branch you're working on if there are violations of rules in your style guide or in your architecture documents if there are details that are missing from the specs if the specs aren't implemented if they're not well tested or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_1EumTaXeE&t=890"

One of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_1EumTaXeE&t=916" target="_blank">00:15:16.940</a></span> | <span class="t">things that we're trying to enable in Sculptor is for people to extend the checks that we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_1EumTaXeE&t=920" target="_blank">00:15:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">have so that they can add their own types of best practices into the code base and make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_1EumTaXeE&t=925" target="_blank">00:15:25.580</a></span> | <span class="t">sure that they are continually checked. After you've found issues, then you have to fix them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_1EumTaXeE&t=934" target="_blank">00:15:34.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Very little of this talk is about fixing the issues because it ends up being a lot easier</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_1EumTaXeE&t=938" target="_blank">00:15:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">for the systems to fix issues than you would expect. I think this quote captures it relatively</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_1EumTaXeE&t=944" target="_blank">00:15:44.620</a></span> | <span class="t">well and that a problem well stated is half solved. What this means is that if you really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_1EumTaXeE&t=949" target="_blank">00:15:49.760</a></span> | <span class="t">understand what went wrong, then it's much easier to solve the problem. This is especially</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_1EumTaXeE&t=955" target="_blank">00:15:55.100</a></span> | <span class="t">true for coding agents because the really simple strategies work really well. So even just try</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_1EumTaXeE&t=961" target="_blank">00:16:01.600</a></span> | <span class="t">multiple times, try a hundred times with a different agent, it actually ends up working out quite</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_1EumTaXeE&t=967" target="_blank">00:16:07.100</a></span> | <span class="t">well. And one of the things that enables this is having really good sandboxing. If you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_1EumTaXeE&t=972" target="_blank">00:16:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">agents that can run safely, then you can run an almost unlimited number, subject to cost constraints, in parallel,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_1EumTaXeE&t=979" target="_blank">00:16:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and then if anyone of them succeeds, then you can use that solution.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_1EumTaXeE&t=982" target="_blank">00:16:22.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is really just the beginning.
