It's basically a system for pulling all the different pieces of your business together into one cohesive system. It's kind of like what I said earlier with the goals, you have your big 10 year goal, maybe in a three-year goal.</p><p>And you track it down to a meeting that you have once a week with your team. But in that meeting, I say out loud in that meeting, like last week, I said I would do blank and I blank like last week. I said, I would call three investors. I called two.</p><p>In other words, I have to fail. I have to publicly fail in front of my team. If I don't deliver on the thing I said I was going to do. So by adding in that piece of the meeting through the book traction, again, we operate on this kind of system, but that piece of the meeting is I said I would do this, I did this, that holds me accountable because although I will let myself down, I don't want to let my team down, right?</p><p>I don't want to let them down. So the more I can obligate myself to things, the more likely the things get done.</p></div></div></body></html>
