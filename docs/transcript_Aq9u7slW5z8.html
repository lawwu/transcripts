This crash course will take us from complete beginners up to advanced users following 12 steps each of which is potentially more useful than the last. Step one starts by us going to bing.com and clicking chat. You'll see this screen with a chat input down below. If you don't see this and don't yet have access to the chatbot feature my tip is to follow the four instructions on the bing.com/new website which are to join the waitlist, set Microsoft defaults and install the bing app. You can easily undo these steps if you like once you're in and I gained access within about 48 hours. Alternatively to be honest bing chat access will be rolled out to everyone eventually. But before we can begin on what bing can do step two involves knowing the limits of bing. If you're a beginner you can start with bing chat and then you can start with bing chat. As of filming you have a 2000 character limit on inputs, a five message per conversation limit and a 50 message per 24 hour period cap. And one further interesting restriction to point out bing really doesn't like it if you try to talk to it about itself. It doesn't even like it if you ask it for its name. I've done a video on this. But now let's get to the good stuff. Step three you can link to articles, pdfs, academic papers and even physical text and engage in a dialogue with bing about what's inside. This is truly revolutionary. I linked to an article in today's new york times about how leonardo da vinci had thoughts about gravity even before newton and I simply asked eli5 explain it like i'm five. Of course bing understood that instruction but what's truly incredible is that it was able to read and digest an article from today, explain it in really simple language, try reading it yourself. Just look at the details it picks out. I could rave about this for ages I've just got so much more to show you. But what did I mean by engaging with physical text? You can take a photo of anything, for example this math problem. Send it to your desktop and then go to google image search. Drag the file onto the screen and this will happen. Click on text to extract the text. Grab the text, in this case the question and you can guess what's coming next. Yes that's right go to bing and paste the question in. Now you can see that bing has a lot of information about the text. It's a lot of information. I know the meme is that GPT powered models aren't good at math but as a math tutor I can say that's old news. I've done plenty of videos on this on my channel, check them out. But AI is getting a lot better at math fast. It gets this question right with a nice explanation. But imagine this for physical text that you want to explore in your environment. Three steps from the camera to a conversation with a super advanced AI about it. Incredible. But it's time for the next step, generating interesting ideas. This could be for youtube, instagram, tiktok, linkedin, whatever. To demonstrate I asked, generate five original youtube video ideas for a new consumer tech review channel. Detailing the novelty of each one, ensure the topics are trending in 2023 and write a detailed synopsis of each video with a hook, a challenge and a reveal. Feel free to steal any of these prompts by the way. And you can read the answers for yourself but I think they're pretty interesting. Any one of these would make a viable video idea, in this case for youtube. Let's read the first one, make a video about the mac mini 2023, the ultimate desktop computer question mark. And the video idea is to test the performance, the design, the features, talk about the m2 chip and how to optimize the mac mini experience. It gives specific examples of the tech that you could compare and suggestions of how to make your video different, like testing them out in different scenarios such as in the gym or at home. What about twitter? It can do that amazingly too. I follow Tim Urban, always coming up with new interesting ideas and I said write five real interesting ideas for youtube. Write down your original tweets in the style of Tim Urban. And these tweets were incredible. You can read all of them but take the fourth one. There are more stars in the observable universe than grains of sand on all the beaches on earth. But there are also more atoms in a single grain of sand than stars in the observable universe. So which is bigger, the universe or a grain of sand? I can imagine him asking that. But let's take this a step further by bringing in image generation. I asked Bing, generate five incredibly descriptive visual mid-journey prompts on topic four. It understood exactly what I meant and came up with these examples. I put them into mid-journey and here's what came out. A grain of sand magnified to reveal a complex microcosm. I think the third result is best here. Or what about the universe as a tiny speck inside a giant eye that belongs to an unknown cosmic entity? Look at the second example. These would definitely be eye-catching in a social media post. Just quickly, here are some of the others. A surreal collage of different images of the earth and the sun. I picked out just a couple of these examples to upscale into a full image with even more detail. And here was one of the results. That is an AI image you can attach to a tweet written by an AI. The world is getting really weird. Before we move on to the next step, let's not forget about the 80/20 principle. Yes, we might let Bing AI do 80% of the work, but you still have to fact check and make these posts, these ideas, even these image generations your own. I wouldn't recommend letting Bing do all the work. And I would definitely check its outputs. It does make mistakes. Next, what about using Bing search to actually, you know, search? Imagine you're looking to move home and look at the kind of search you can do with Bing AI. Compare property price trends, commute to King's Cross times, crime rates, median ages, and green spaces in the two London boroughs of Haringey versus Barnet. And here are the details. And of course, I could continue this conversation by asking more about green spaces, median age, etc. Compare this result to Google. Now, I still do use Google and will continue to. But honestly, these results are just not too useful. I would have to click on multiple links to even have a hope of coming up with some of the answers that I've already gotten. Let me give you two more examples to balance it out. I asked Bing list five electric car charging points nearest to Big Ben in London. And it gave me five charging points. And these do check out. They are near Big Ben, and they are suitable. But they are all from Q Park. And Google gave me more varied results. So I count that as a win for Google. Another win for Google came when I asked, where can I buy flowers nearest to the second option? It understood what I wanted, but gave me some online options. Even when I was more specific and said I need a physical store florist within 15 minutes walk, it gave me some pretty poor results. Google did much better. How about doing a search for shopping? Well, I asked for the best battery cases for the iPhone 14. And it gave me some good options. And then I was more specific. I want the biggest battery capacity and it must be under 30 pounds. These were some decent results, but I would have hoped for direct links for purchasing these cases. Remember, every click counts in the war between Google and Bing. Even when I said compare these two cases for me, which is what Bing suggests, I said, it did give me this nice table, but again, no direct links. And one extra slight warning. It suggested a case that isn't actually available in the UK, despite me making it fairly clear that I was from the UK by asking for the price in pounds. And of course, my IP being in the UK. So in terms of search, the wind still goes to Google, but Bing chat does have its use cases. The next step to being an advanced user is to use Bing AI to improve your writing. A student of mine wrote this as their introductory paragraph for their personal statement, a bit like a cover letter for a university. It's not bad, no spelling mistakes, but the writing is kind of bland. And look what Bing was able to suggest. These are nuanced comments, a step change from ChatGPT. If you want to learn more, by the way, about how Bing AI is smarter than ChatGPT, I've done two videos on this topic on my channel. Let's look at a couple of the suggestions. It says the introduction is too long and verbose. It could be shortened by removing unnecessary details and using more concise language. For example, instead of saying, I have always been an observant and enthusiastic individual, always looking for answers to how and why things work in a particular way, which is what my student wrote. You could say, I have always been curious and eager to learn how things work. Much shorter, a great suggestion. Bing goes further and actually rewrites the introduction. I have read this, you can too, and it is a significant improvement. I mean, you could improve it still further, but that would take real writing skill to do. But notice it didn't just spit out the output. It gave reasons for each of its suggestions. And that's vital if you want to learn and improve. Next step is Bing's ability to tell jokes and do creative writing. This is kind of a hit and miss affair. It's quite hard to get Bing to do what you want, but when it does, it works really well. Notice what I tried. I said, write five actually funny original jokes, and it found jokes from the web. Now, I think some of these are quite funny. For example, what do you call cheese that isn't yours? Nacho cheese. But these aren't original. It stole these. So I said, write five jokes about Twitter. And the first one's decent. Again, these aren't Bing jokes, though. They're stolen. First joke is, a man tells his doctor, Doc, help me. I'm addicted to Twitter. The doctor replies, sorry, I don't follow you. Not bad. Three of the jokes, by the way, aren't even about Twitter. Not sure what's going on there. But then when I asked it to do a comedy skit, I initially faced some problems. I was told that I was going to be a doctor. I was told that I was going to be a doctor. I was told that I was going to be a doctor. I was told that I was going to be a doctor. The first two times I asked, it simply refused. It said that topic is too sensitive and controversial for me to joke about. It was going to be about TikTok, Donald Trump, Elon Musk. I tried again, removing the brand name of TikTok, and just said social media, and again it refused. However, I tried one more time and made it fully generic, and it picked up on what I actually wanted and wrote something great. I asked, somewhat generically, write a funny and creative story about a billionaire buying a big social media company and using it to promote his posts. This time it complied. And you can read it for yourself, but I think it's quite entertaining. Elon Musk was bored. He had already conquered space, electric cars, tunnels, and brain chips. He wanted a new challenge. He wanted to own Twitter. It goes on and on, and then finally ends with, Twitter became Elon Musk's playground, and nightmare, and empire. The end. So it can do creative writing if you prod it in the right way. In the next step, more advanced now, you can use it as a kind of free consultant. A swap. Your analysis assesses the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of a given business. And Bing was able to do this for a startup I chose almost at random, Hugging Face. It's answers are detailed and interesting. Imagine this applied to your business. And of course you can continue the conversation or follow the links to find out more. Next, it could help on a more granular level. You can use it to respond to reviews. This is a real review, two stars, posted about the Peninsula Hotel in Paris. I'm going to let you compare the response that Bing provides with the actual response that the Peninsula Hotel Paris wrote on TripAdvisor. Essentially this person was complaining about lots of things, mentioning some positives, but complaining about quite a few things as well. And my prompt was, write a polite, professional, and detailed response to this review. I think this response is incredible. It goes into detail, addressing each of the points. And this was a mind blown moment. It actually uses a real email. I checked this. I'm going to read this and compare it to the official response. I mean the response is professional and it is polite, but it's far less detailed. There are some grammar issues and it doesn't address all of the points. If you could have a professional response ready instantaneously for any of your customer reviews, wouldn't that help your business? Next, you can use Bing AI to get into, or to get better at, coding. I'm a beginner at coding, but it was able to help me get better at coding. I think it's a great way to get better fast. Take this simple request. I've experimented with probably a hundred pieces of code, but I just wanted to give you a simple example. I asked, write Python code that will add 5% to a user's number and then divide by three. This is a simple math request that you can imagine being used for a restaurant, for example. If you're new to code, you can always try this out in an application like VS Code, or just run the code online as a fun experiment. I pasted it into online-ide.com, for example, which has quite a few coding languages to choose from, and then you press run. It will prompt you for a number. I entered a number and it gave me the correct result. Only your imagination can limit you in terms of what you can try out with coding, even for complete beginners, now that you have Bing and ChatGPT. Next step, you could use Bing Chat as a quick and easy review aggregator. Only if things you don't care too much about, for example, like TV shows, movies, restaurants maybe, anything particularly important, you want to check the reviews yourself. But here's what it came up with when I asked it for IMDB Rotten Tomatoes Metacritic Empire and Guardian reviews of The Last of Us in detail. Some of these numbers are a little off because I think it got confused with the game. And even when I clarified, it didn't give the most comprehensive result imaginable. But for quick and easy review aggregation, I think it might get really handy. Same for testing out any worries you might have about a restaurant or hotel. For example, I asked, are there any negatives for staying at the Peninsula Hotel Paris? I feel like I'm picking on that hotel. It is one of the best hotels in the world apparently. I'm definitely not trying to pick on it. But Bing was able to find some negatives that reviewers have pointed out. This saved the time of me scrolling through the reviews to find out what might be a slight issue. Skip straight to the positives and the negatives. Next step, simply using it as a tutor. And I say this as a tutor. But I certainly couldn't find you five peer reviewed studies on the link between career team consumption and cognitive performance, nor could I summarize the findings instantaneously. Here are the results. And of course, I could continue this conversation and ask about the molecules inside creatine, the sources of it, the cost of it, other reasons for taking it, reasons not to take it. Or let's say you don't care about creatine and you want to know about large language models, the models behind Bing AI and ChatGPT. You can use Bing to teach you. It can't quite explain advanced math and English. But it's free and can give you a great start on a topic. It's also never grouchy and doesn't need any coffee. So that's another plus. Finally a bonus step. You can use it to improve your own health. I said, write me a high protein vegetarian meal plan for a week and give me five tips on how to actually stick to it. The tips were decent. So I followed up by saying, give me this as a daily meal plan. Include protein shakes. It gave me a one day meal plan and even told me how to do it. I thought that was a great idea. But it was not. So I decided to do a few simple exercises. Think of it more as a source of inspiration rather than a final authority on any matter. If you think of it like that, Bing's utility is almost endless. If you want to find out more about just how smart the new Bing is, check out my Bing chat playlist. I detail Bing's current IQ. It's sometimes surprising conversations. If you check out my GPT-4 playlist, you can find out about 8 upgrades that may be coming to Bing AI in the near future. If you found these steps at all useful, please do let me know in the comments. It really motivates me to make more such videos. Have a wonderful day.</p></div></body></html>
