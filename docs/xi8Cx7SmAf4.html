So with a addiction, there's usually some sort of very powerful stimulus that becomes the driver for the addiction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi8Cx7SmAf4&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The feeling of intoxication, right.

And you have to figure, is this worth the anxiety? Is this one not?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi8Cx7SmAf4&t=447" target="_blank">00:07:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Things can fall apart. It's hard to do things at a high level. So there's negatives that come with it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi8Cx7SmAf4&t=451" target="_blank">00:07:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, I constantly have to make these decisions. There's things I, you know, television things I've turned down, for example, that may be in isolation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi8Cx7SmAf4&t=459" target="_blank">00:07:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You say, well, that's cool. Like I know that show. That would be really cool to go on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi8Cx7SmAf4&t=461" target="_blank">00:07:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's like, I can't do all of these things. And if I did, it's going to overwhelm me with time constraints.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi8Cx7SmAf4&t=467" target="_blank">00:07:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Anxiety, I have to be careful about how I make my path. So it's tricky.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi8Cx7SmAf4&t=472" target="_blank">00:07:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think it's a really good question, Ben. If you're going the route of let me just be exceptional, you can build depth around that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi8Cx7SmAf4&t=479" target="_blank">00:07:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And there are some real positives you're going to get, but there's also negatives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi8Cx7SmAf4&t=482" target="_blank">00:08:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I say that because I think that then when you get the scale between the quiet remarkability approach versus the exceptional, notable, famous remarkability approach, when you put the cons with the pros on this ladder, the scales become about balanced.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi8Cx7SmAf4&t=499" target="_blank">00:08:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you really if you're going the quiet remarkability approach, a life that, you know, it's Lorelei Gilmore and the Gilmore Girls, not famous outside of Star's Hollow, not like exceptional at anything, but in that world, you know, is really well known and has built this really interesting life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi8Cx7SmAf4&t=519" target="_blank">00:08:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And people really know her and appreciate her and she's involved in people's lives and having a positive impact on that town. But she's not famous outside of that small little town. That's quiet remarkability, not so bad of a path.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi8Cx7SmAf4&t=532" target="_blank">00:08:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, I don't want to say the other path, the sort of exceptional remarkability is bad. I'm just saying when you have the pros and the cons, it's no longer like, well, this is clearly better if you have the skill, you know, you have the whatever. I can shoot a really good jump shot. I could go that way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi8Cx7SmAf4&t=545" target="_blank">00:09:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If you have the possibility to go that way, it's not bad, but it's also not a no brainer. And if you don't see an obvious way to get to the exceptional remarkability, you shouldn't feel bad about it because, again, these things balance out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi8Cx7SmAf4&t=556" target="_blank">00:09:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Steph Curry versus Lorelei Gilmore, that old famous comparison like there's I don't know, there's plus and minuses to both. So neither should be dismissive of the other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi8Cx7SmAf4&t=568" target="_blank">00:09:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a weird I might be the first person in history to make that particular comparison. Probably. I mean, I can't imagine it's come up in the locker room, you know, the NBA finals stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi8Cx7SmAf4&t=581" target="_blank">00:09:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is your Lorelei moment, buddy. This is it. You got to just get out there. I want you to man up and Lorelei this. All right. I mean, you got to your dribbling should be like the fast speech cadence of Lorelei Gilmore confusing people with as you move back and forth verbally through various things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi8Cx7SmAf4&t=600" target="_blank">00:10:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is the Kirk of your town. But you need to get the ball to Luke. There's probably some basketball strategy metaphor. The end of that speech would be like, hold on one second. Someone's hand me a piece of paper and I'm fired. And then the coach just walks out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi8Cx7SmAf4&t=615" target="_blank">00:10:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that story ends. Like, yeah, that makes sense. And I was fired. All right. Nonsense. Stop the nonsense. Let's move on. What do we got next?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi8Cx7SmAf4&t=622" target="_blank">00:10:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. Great. Next question is from Samantha. How important are having friends in life? If it is important, how would you recommend an introvert go about finding some? Also, can you provide some advice on moving on from certain friendships that could be holding someone back?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi8Cx7SmAf4&t=637" target="_blank">00:10:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's a good compliment to Tanya's questions about being more social and confident. Friends, as I mentioned, there are critically important. And for a friendship to be real, it has to involve non-trivial sacrifice of time and attention. Otherwise, your brain doesn't treat it as real.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi8Cx7SmAf4&t=653" target="_blank">00:10:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So just texting someone all the time doesn't count. Commenting on their social media doesn't count. Being active in a WhatsApp channel with them also does not count. As far as your brain is concerned, they're not a friend until you're going places and doing things with them, doing things you might not otherwise want to do, but you're doing it because they're your friend.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi8Cx7SmAf4&t=672" target="_blank">00:11:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's when your brain begins to take the relationship seriously. So this should be a regular part of your weekly planning, especially if you're trying to build up friendships as something that's more important than a regular part of your weekly planning should be. What am I doing this week to strengthen or develop friendships? You have to be pretty systematic about it, especially if you're sort of getting back in the saddle, so to speak.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi8Cx7SmAf4&t=695" target="_blank">00:11:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So fortunately, I can point you towards a resource here. There was a segment we did a few episodes back on this notion of the friendship recession, this idea that Americans in particular have less friends than ever before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi8Cx7SmAf4&t=709" target="_blank">00:11:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There was a segment where I had my friend Jamie Kilstein come on and talk about what he went through to gain a new group of friends in his 40s as a male, where this is kind of difficult. So we got into the weeds in that episode about specific things you can do to actually find and cultivate friends.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi8Cx7SmAf4&t=725" target="_blank">00:12:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I won't repeat that all, but I will say find that segment on the friendship recession. That was a final segment on a relatively recent episode. Maybe Jamie you can look or Jesse. Jesse knows whenever Jamie's on, I begin just furiously messing up their names.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi8Cx7SmAf4&t=741" target="_blank">00:12:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because as Jesse has pointed out is maybe it's because Joe Rogan's podcast producer is named Jamie. So it's just in the collective conscious of like Jamie is what you call the other person on a microphone when you're podcasting. So it doesn't take much to tip me into that. He'll look that up. But anyways, I think it was 266, 266 take control of your technology habits.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi8Cx7SmAf4&t=763" target="_blank">00:12:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. Episode 266, deeplife.com/listen. You'll find that in the video for it's there as well. So look at that discussion with Jamie, because I think this is critically important, especially if you do not have a robust group of friends. Think about that, like getting in shape. It's going to require a lot of work on a regular basis with some tried and true tactics, but it is absolutely, absolutely worth doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi8Cx7SmAf4&t=785" target="_blank">00:13:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, Jesse. See, I almost said Jamie there. I'm telling you, it's like very difficult once you start thinking about that. Hey, if you like this video, I think you'll really like this one as well. Check it out.</span></div></div></body></html>
