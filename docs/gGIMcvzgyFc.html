He writes in and says this, "I'm a fighter pilot in the US Air Force, and the point you mentioned in episode 306 about possibly sending someone to hell by killing them sometimes weighs on me and other Christian servicemen I know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGIMcvzgyFc&t=48" target="_blank">00:00:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">For a Christian, how is defending your nation by killing and war different than defending your family by killing? Would you ever advocate Christians not serve in the military due to God commanding Christians not to repay evil for evil?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGIMcvzgyFc&t=62" target="_blank">00:01:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And related to this, Tyler Drummond in Pennsylvania asks, "In episode 306 you said that you would rather be killed than to kill another because for you it would mean instant joy and for him it would mean instant hell.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGIMcvzgyFc&t=73" target="_blank">00:01:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">How can capital punishment then be justified because killing a non-believer assures that they will not come to Christ?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGIMcvzgyFc&t=80" target="_blank">00:01:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's a mix of related follow-up questions here for you, Pastor John.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGIMcvzgyFc&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It seems to me, Tony, that there are two crucial queries here as to what I said about guns and my not having one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGIMcvzgyFc&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">One is whether there is a sufficient warrant for not killing him, and the other is whether the New Testament command not to return evil for evil is a sufficient warrant for a Christian not to be a soldier or a policeman.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGIMcvzgyFc&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it seems to me as I've thought about those two queries, we should probably split them up because they're both pretty heavy and complicated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGIMcvzgyFc&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So let me tackle the first one and maybe we'll give a second podcast to the second one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGIMcvzgyFc&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first question is the possibility of sending someone to hell if you take his life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGIMcvzgyFc&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When I said that I would rather be killed than kill, and then I mentioned that my assailant may not be ready to face eternity, and I am, I didn't mean that was my primary reason for not killing him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGIMcvzgyFc&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I would say the same thing, I think, if I knew that my assailant was heaven-bound as a Christian, that I would prefer to be killed than to kill.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGIMcvzgyFc&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the key here is how Jesus argues for not returning good, for returning good for evil.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGIMcvzgyFc&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">His main argument is not that our adversary will benefit from our behavior.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGIMcvzgyFc&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He may or he may not. Jesus doesn't make that the issue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGIMcvzgyFc&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The main way Jesus argues is that when we sacrifice ourselves and our goods for others, we show the value of God himself as our reward. And this would be true whether our enemy is a believer or an unbeliever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGIMcvzgyFc&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So Luke 635, "Love your enemies and your reward will be great. You will be the sons of the Most High."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGIMcvzgyFc&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's the motive. Or Matthew 546, "If you love those who love you, what reward do you have?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGIMcvzgyFc&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Or Matthew 511, "Blessed are you when you're persecuted on my account. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGIMcvzgyFc&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the reason we sacrifice our lives for our enemies, not only in the hope of saving themâ€”oh yes, we do. We pray for those who persecute us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGIMcvzgyFc&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But to show the world where our treasure is, where our reward is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGIMcvzgyFc&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I didn't mean to argue that I would rather be killed than to kill, because it's always wrong to take the life of a person who may go to hell.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGIMcvzgyFc&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I didn't mean to do that. If I gave that impression, I gave a misimpression.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGIMcvzgyFc&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, I think the Bible is pretty clear that there are situations in which taking the life of another person without even knowing his spiritual state is right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGIMcvzgyFc&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">One of those situations is in military defense against aggression and police defense of citizens against criminals, and another is capital punishment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGIMcvzgyFc&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">God has ordained that the state share in God's divine rights, for example, to take the life of murderers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGIMcvzgyFc&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Romans 13, 2, "There is no authority except from God. Those who exist have been instituted by God. The ruler is God's servant for good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGIMcvzgyFc&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He does not bear the sword in vain, for he is the servant of God."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGIMcvzgyFc&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the sword bearers, the billy club bearers, the gun bearers are servants of God, an avenger who carries out God's wrath on the wrongdoer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGIMcvzgyFc&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When the soldiers asked John the Baptist what they should do in response to his command to bear fruits worthy of repentance,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGIMcvzgyFc&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">he did not say, "Stop being a soldier, for goodness sakes, who carries a sword and goes to war."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGIMcvzgyFc&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He didn't say that. He said in Luke 3, 14, "Do not extort money from anyone by threats or by false accusation. Be content with your wages."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGIMcvzgyFc&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In other words, you've got a sword in your hand. Beware. Don't use it that way. It has a limited place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGIMcvzgyFc&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You are a servant of God to work His wrath on the wrongdoer. You are not to abuse your authority and your power in order to aggrandize yourself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGIMcvzgyFc&t=379" target="_blank">00:06:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So yes to policemen and yes to soldiers. And with regard to capital punishment, nothing in the New Testament that I can see overturns the principle of Genesis 9, 6,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGIMcvzgyFc&t=391" target="_blank">00:06:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGIMcvzgyFc&t=395" target="_blank">00:06:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Why? "For God made man in His own image."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGIMcvzgyFc&t=399" target="_blank">00:06:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In other words, the dignity of man and the value of man created in the image of God is not what hinders capital punishment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGIMcvzgyFc&t=408" target="_blank">00:06:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's what requires it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGIMcvzgyFc&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So here's the summary of what I've just said. Christian enemy love that sacrifices itself and official state enemy punishment that protects citizens both declare truths about God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGIMcvzgyFc&t=429" target="_blank">00:07:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Christian self-sacrifice declares that our God is all satisfying. He's our treasure. He's our reward. He will fully satisfy us in the end. He will settle all accounts in the age to come.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGIMcvzgyFc&t=441" target="_blank">00:07:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And secondly, state punishment declares God is God of justice. He ordains that there is a limit to evil.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGIMcvzgyFc&t=450" target="_blank">00:07:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Even in this world, He will not tolerate it to go beyond certain means, and He is a God of justice now and in the world to come.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGIMcvzgyFc&t=460" target="_blank">00:07:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Both of those are true, and Christians are involved in saying both with their lives in the ways that the New Testament prescribes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGIMcvzgyFc&t=471" target="_blank">00:07:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you, Pastor John.
