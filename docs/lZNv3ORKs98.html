And I'll walk by a hull of a strawberry. And I'm thinking, and I, this morning I thought,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=72" target="_blank">00:01:12.600</a></span> | <span class="t">oh my Easter is going to laugh at me.

I'm not just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=75" target="_blank">00:01:15.880</a></span> | <span class="t">scattering them around my home, by the way. But I'm like, like, what is it? Like we create these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.960</a></span> | <span class="t">barriers to doing the simplest of things. So what are some difficult things that we can introduce</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=85" target="_blank">00:01:25.340</a></span> | <span class="t">to our daily routine that have been shown to make us feel better besides exercise, sunlight,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.380</a></span> | <span class="t">and cold water?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So sort of my big picture answer here is my substack is called the 2% newsletter. And I'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=100" target="_blank">00:01:40.280</a></span> | <span class="t">tell you why it's called 2%. So there's this study that found that only 2% of people take the stairs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.900</a></span> | <span class="t">when there's an escalator available. 2%. Now, 100% of people know that if they were to take the stairs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">that would be better for them, right? They get a better long-term return on their health,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=117" target="_blank">00:01:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">on their wellbeing. And yet 98% of people do the easier thing that could actually hurt them in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=124" target="_blank">00:02:04.860</a></span> | <span class="t">long run in the context of this environment where we don't move enough. So this tells me that we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=129" target="_blank">00:02:09.500</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of wired to do the next easiest thing. But living better in modern life often requires doing these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">slightly uncomfortable things that are just so obvious and in front of us. And it's like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you have to get to the second floor. So which route are you going to take? You're going to take</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.540</a></span> | <span class="t">the one that's a little bit uncomfortable now, but improves your life in the long run? Or are you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">going to do the easy thing that might actually hurt you in the long run? So that to me is just a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">metaphor for like, how do you improve in daily life, right? In the trenches of daily life, how do you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.420</a></span> | <span class="t">improve? So I apply this, I try and apply this to as many different areas in my life as I can. It's like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.620</a></span> | <span class="t">if I can make something just a little bit more uncomfortable, I'm not talking about extreme,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">do the slightly harder thing that I know will give me a long-term return. I got to take that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So for me, it's like, okay, if I'm in my office, go through some examples, and I have a phone call,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.980</a></span> | <span class="t">I could sit here and take the phone call, or I could pop in my headphones and I could go for a walk and I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.840</a></span> | <span class="t">could take that call while walking. I would say for the vast majority of phone calls, unless you're like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">talking to the CEO, your big boss, right? Maybe sit behind the computer for that one. But like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you're getting in all these steps that are going to be beneficial. And steps are one of like the metric</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">that is most correlated to better health. Like people just need to generally walk more. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.280</a></span> | <span class="t">that's an easy way to do it. It's like, you got to take the call. Might as well get some steps in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.500</a></span> | <span class="t">as you do it, right? Things like that. Things like, could you even just carry your groceries</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.380</a></span> | <span class="t">at the grocery store? You get the basket, you're carrying stuff. You're getting in this like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">low load of carrying that's going to really help with back health, strength, all these different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.160</a></span> | <span class="t">things. Even things as simple as like, I'm going to park in the farthest spot away. Like people go,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.560</a></span> | <span class="t">roll their eyes and go, that's so obvious. Everyone says that. It's like, okay, but no one actually does</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.580</a></span> | <span class="t">it. And if you look at just non-exercise activity thermogen, it's neat. This is basically a dorky way of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.380</a></span> | <span class="t">saying all the movement in a person's life that isn't dedicated exercise. That often outweighs the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.240</a></span> | <span class="t">benefits of exercise in many studies. Certainly by calories burned. Certainly by calories burned.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Also, some data suggests even health outcomes in the long run. There's some Mayo Clinic data that says</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.480</a></span> | <span class="t">that people who just move around a lot more in their daily life, they're burning like 800 calories just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">from moving around, this incidental movement. It's like running eight miles or something. If you do some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">really rough back of hand math, right? And so I think looking for those opportunities, even beyond</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.440</a></span> | <span class="t">exercise, something like, so in the comfort crisis, I write about a value of silence, for example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.600</a></span> | <span class="t">We have increased the world's loudness fourfold as human beings. And yet silence is actually pretty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">good for us in this context of noise. So you put someone in silence and like, yeah, it's a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.300</a></span> | <span class="t">uncomfortable at first. People will generally report being like, oh, it's so quiet. This is weird.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, weirded out. But as time goes on, people tend to calm down. It's sort of like a nice reset. And so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.500</a></span> | <span class="t">can you even go, hey, like I go into my office and I just start blasting music immediately. Like most</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=316" target="_blank">00:05:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">people keep the TV on, who keep the TV on all day. It's not that they're watching it. It's that they just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.980</a></span> | <span class="t">need noise in the background or else they feel weird. But if you can sort of cut that out, even though</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">it's a little bit hard at first, it's probably going to improve you over the long run. Like how can we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.100</a></span> | <span class="t">apply this to different areas? I did a post. It's called the 2% manifesto on my sub stack. So I'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.420</a></span> | <span class="t">link to it in that link I mentioned. And it lists a bunch of different ways. I think it really is. It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">just like this mindset shift. Like how can I take this thing I have to do and maybe make it a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=345" target="_blank">00:05:45.820</a></span> | <span class="t">bit harder and get a benefit. And once you start to stack those things up, like things start moving,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.320</a></span> | <span class="t">things start changing. Yeah, I agree. I, um, you know, my trivial example about the strawberry</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=356" target="_blank">00:05:56.380</a></span> | <span class="t">hulls, which I always put like next to the bowl of strawberries and they'll just sit there.

And I think there's something about forward ambulation, uh, with other people that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=626" target="_blank">00:10:26.020</a></span> | <span class="t">is really, um, life giving. And there's something even sort of spiritual about it and the amount of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=631" target="_blank">00:10:31.980</a></span> | <span class="t">connection that you can get from people. So that's something that we definitely do. And I don't think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=635" target="_blank">00:10:35.340</a></span> | <span class="t">those conversations would come if we were like, let's sit on the couch.

I would also say there's a, there's a section in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=651" target="_blank">00:10:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">comfort crisis and I've written about this a little bit in my other book, scarcity brains.

It's like this hyper stimulating content. But I think that sort of sitting with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=715" target="_blank">00:11:55.300</a></span> | <span class="t">boredom and leveraging it to see where else it might take you beyond a screen can be really valuable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=720" target="_blank">00:12:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, it's uncomfortable.

What do people do? Everyone's on their cell phone. Like you can't just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=825" target="_blank">00:13:45.300</a></span> | <span class="t">like sit with our thoughts for more than three seconds.

Well, I'm chuckling because what were your thoughts on the brief appearance of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=846" target="_blank">00:14:06.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the raw dog flight experience that showed up last year? Did you see that? Where guys were posting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=851" target="_blank">00:14:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">online, it did seem to be guys, saying that they quote unquote raw dog, terrible use of language.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=858" target="_blank">00:14:18.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, I didn't pick it. Uh, they would do a 10 hour flight or a six hour flight with no media. Just sit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=867" target="_blank">00:14:27.300</a></span> | <span class="t">there as a, as a kind of sign of their toughness. I thought it was kind of interesting. Uh, here's what,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=874" target="_blank">00:14:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">here's what came out of that is my wife said, the hell these guys are weak. She's been doing that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNv3ORKs98&t=881" target="_blank">00:14:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">ever since I knew her.
