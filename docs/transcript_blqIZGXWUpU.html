house he has i love david's house what a house that made the biggest impression huh thank you sir i heard you have a pretty nice house too yeah i have a dealer in a nice house we like it's only worth 18 million right like i know the judge said 18 million people said palm beach has gone down a long way hello everybody oh thanks so much for sitting down with us mr president the all-in pods basically the four of us having conversations it's kind of a spectrum of different views we got sort of like a little bit of some fox news and then some msdnc at the same time so that's okay keeps it interesting yeah absolutely anyway chamath and i we we had a great time at the at the fundraiser that we did a couple weeks ago i think it turned out turned out great and i i heard the winkelvoss brothers are actually announcing that they're donating a million dollars each in bitcoin to you tomorrow so i think that's a great result to come out of it as well got to meet them for the first time at your house and uh terrific terrific they they did well like they might have started the whole thing i don't know i don't know i don't know if that court case was proper but uh they were very nice both of them absolutely really nice guys you know and i think maybe this is a good place to start in our conversation is you know one of the things i think we heard a lot at that dinner was just the the difficulty that people in business were having under this biden administration you got the crypto guys who just want a framework they just want the government to tell them how to operate and they can't get that you got no m&a happening right now in tech the real estate guys they can't get loans because the interest rates are through the roof and there's a credit crunch so i think one of the common themes we just heard across that dinner was that it was just so hard to do business right now and i guess maybe a good place to start would just be you know what what's the number one thing or maybe the top three things that you would do to kind of get things moving again you know if you're re-elected so i say regulation regulation and taxes okay you know i gave the biggest tax cut in the history of our country and a lot to business it took it down from look as you know they were paying people companies were paying 40 45 including state and city taxes in many cases and we got it down to 21 we'd like to get it down lower actually but we got it down and the revenues were were better than ever even with the lower rate we had a record record revenues which tells you a little bit about that but also the regulations and when i asked a lot of people a lot of big people a lot of corporate types big corporate types i said if you had your choice between just the taxes or just the regulations where did i do better he said the regulations i was the biggest cutter of regular in four years i cut more regulations than anybody by four nope by far not not even close and when i spoke to different people about the regulation versus the taxes i don't think i've ever had anybody say and the taxes were a massive cut you know from 37 38 if you look at it just there to 21 i don't think i ever had anybody say that the taxes were more important than the regulation cuts i made it possible to build i made it possible to do things to invest i was able to get companies with a lot of money outside of the usa to bring that money back in you know we cut the rate and it was crazy the rate was like 55 so that means if they bring the money back they lose half their money before they even start but it was also uh impossible from a standpoint a structural standpoint a legal standpoint it's very hard and they were able to bring back i mean apple's an example they brought hundreds of billions of dollars back from other countries into the united states and invested it here so uh but it's very interesting because i asked the question all the time which was more important and almost everybody said i did an even better job and i got the biggest tax cuts the biggest tax cuts bigger than the reagan tax cuts but they found regulations and the regulation cuts were even more effective and that's where we had the great economy and that's where we had the most jobs ever produced so there's this odd thing that happens in certain states where taxes keep going up and then you start to see the states break right productivity breaks crime goes up and quality of life goes down but then people don't understand that taxation and all of those things are correlated do you have an idea of why that is like why don't people understand universally that lower taxation is better for productivity well they don't understand it and it's such an interesting question because you look at some of these places like chicago and new york and and la and so many more you know i'd hate to even mention the three because there are worse examples than that you look at what's happened in oakland and you look at what's happened into some cities that are disappearing i mean they're literally just crime waves nobody lives there except for criminals because you can't live there you can't survive there physically you can't survive there and when you look at the kind of crime that we're talking about and then they take the power away from the police the police can't do anything if they do anything to stop it they end up losing their pension their house their family they end up losing everything they get put in jail and we're not talking about the rogue cops who do something really bad and should be taken care of badly you know be nasty you got to be nasty to them also but mostly i mean they these people they want to really like 99 they want to stop crime they hate to see it they're not allowed to even they're told not to do anything when you see a department store that was so proud they opened up a new store in a certain city and all of a sudden this over the last couple of years has happened this phenomenon where 500 usually young people walk into the store and take everything they have masks on they walk out with television sets air conditioners they walk out with everything this is a new phenomenon that's taken place and it's it's incredible uh look at drug stores look at what's going on like in new york you walk into a chain i've seen it twice i don't walk into too many drug stores but i used to love it i used to love to walk around and just look at what it is whether it's a drug store or department store but they told me just a little while ago i had a meeting with some people and they say you walk into a drug store in new york and everything's covered up with bars and glass and if you want just a little thing of aspirin or if you want to buy a toothbrush you have to wait a half an hour to get a clerk and they open up this vault and they give you a toothbrush or they give you it's how do you do business like that this is a phenomenon there's never been anything like this they didn't used to have theft of of even the most minor items they they had very little theft relatively speaking they didn't have theft but they had the police would arrest them if they did something today they don't they have limits sometimes if you steal less than two thousand dollars you don't get arrested so nobody steals more than two thousand dollars it's incredible when you see what's happened to the quality of life in our country and it's happened so quickly it's it's taken place so rapidly nobody's ever seen anything but you look at retail and i know the big deal it used to be a big deal when a department store moved into a city or you know a certain store opened up even in a town but it's usually the democrat run big cities where this problem is taking place and i don't say that as a republican i just say you look at the 25 cities the top problems they're just about all democrat the democrat run and they're also high tax high regulation states yeah no cash bail all these different things that have taken place they're phenomena it's a phenomena what's what's going on nobody's ever seen anything like it and it has to be stopped it's a horrible quality of life and on top of that you can't walk to a store you end up getting shot or mugged or something the level of crime in the cities in these big cities is is out of control nobody has ever seen anything like it mr president can i can i just ask on your point about the tax cut larry summers made a comment the other day and i thought maybe you could respond to his tweet that the tax cuts coupled with the tariffs that you've proposed would cause a massive i think he called it the mother of all stagflation where you would have kind of inflation because of the tariffs you would have economic decline because more money would start to fund an increase in prices with tax coming down tax cuts being put in place can you maybe just comment on on the comment made by larry summers and how we implement tax cuts without inflation well let me say that i respect larry summers a lot he's been right about a lot of things and obama and biden have been wrong uh certain things that he said turned out to be true certain things and uh he really i do have a good respect for him he's a different kind of a guy and he speaks his mind i happen to be a big believer in tariffs because i think tariffs give you two things they give you economic gain but they also give you political gain if if a country is out of control and something having nothing to do with economics or having nothing to do with with money coming in or money going out but other things that are very political because there are a lot of other things involved in countries you have tremendous power over a country now not everybody can say that but we can because we're the big piggy bank but our piggy bank is going to get smaller and smaller all the time because we're losing power we're losing a lot of you know countries on the dollar i mean they're going like flies if we ever lose that that's the equivalent of losing a war that would be an unbelievable that would really make us third world we have lost so many countries i looked the other day so russia's gone uh you you take a look ukraine doesn't sort of exist in a sense nobody knows what's going on there but when you look at china is essentially gone they're trying to get out of it they want they're a primary competitor uh iran is not there the other day i read where saudi arabia is willing to now go in various different currencies on set of the dollar this is a tragedy this is a big thing that's happening against our country and we cannot let that happen with tariffs it gives you a tremendous power as an example not to let that happen you say you want to do that we're going to put tariffs on your product coming into the united states but more importantly and that's a big importance but probably of more importance is they tax us we tax them reciprocal trade i think we should have a reciprocal trade act if china is going to charge us a hundred dollars tariff or a hundred percent tariff on a car then we should say you're going to pay a hundred percent to us you know i put on a large tariff on china cars coming in and it had a huge impact a huge positive impact but and biden only is doing the electric cars i don't know why that is because the electric cars are going to end up all being made in china by the way they're not going to be made here the united auto workers are going to take a blow like no unions are between that and people coming in pouring into our country unions are getting absolutely decimated absolutely trump but the reciprocal the reciprocal act is i think a very important thing when these countries and i don't mean just china we have other countries you could take the european union they don't want our farm product and they don't want our cars and they don't want anything we have a massive deficit right there but you could go with many countries and they essentially do things to us and we should do things to them basically it should be reciprocal one of the things we've talked about president trump on this podcast a lot is the deficit under your administration we added close to eight trillion under biden it's going to be paradoxically about the same number seems incredibly unpopular in washington to cut costs but that's something we're going to need to do what's your plan and it looks like you're going to win a second term here what's your plan in your second term to control spending can you get it under control is there the will in washington to allow you to do that well the biggest thing i think is growth because we can grow our way out as an example we have more liquid gold under our feet i use the term we have more oils we have more wells we have more everything than anybody else when i started we were number three now we're number one we were number one he's going to keep it that way until after the election if they ever won the election there's no more oil coming out there's no more oil they were going down oil is what caused the inflation you'd have nothing coming out it would be a disaster so they were intelligent enough to let the the oil wells continue to go they're not happy about it but if this election were won by them i can tell you right now you would be we would see oil go through the roof because they would really close it up already they're taken out of the strategic reserves just for politics because they want to try and keep the prices down as low as possible but the big thing we have tremendous growth potential and we have tremendous numbers of dollars that can be saved through efficiency the way we're spending money hundreds of billions of dollars what biden did with with the trillions of dollars that he borrowed for covet now i had a different situation we were getting ready to start paying off debt we were getting ready to make a lot we had the greatest economy in history i had to throw a lot of money at covet in order that we didn't end up in a 1929 type depression which we could still end up in now because of what they've done but i threw a lot of money in and we ended up not in a depression and then we ended up with a very strong you know we i ended up with a higher stock market than it was just previous to covet coming in which was pretty much of a miracle according to most but we had to throw money out there in order to keep our country going we would have ended up if i didn't do that we would have ended up in a depression the problem is when biden came in he took trillions and trillions of dollars for covet he didn't use it for covet he used it for other things but he took trillions of dollars out and that caused a lot of the inflation energy caused his energy policies caused inflation and his spending the unbelievable spending that they did caused inflation tremendous inflation and it's going to have an impact for a long time to come can you talk about your impoundment authority intention you mentioned that in the past that you could go in and reduce the bureaucracy and the spend i always tell people my position going into the election is less that i'm interested in knowing what the government's going to do for me and i'm more interested in knowing what the government's going to stop doing that doesn't do any good for anyone and there seems to be a lot of that and i'm really curious to hear sir how you think about using the impoundment authority vested in you as the president of the united states to reduce some of the bureaucracy wasteful spending and create accountability and what's the you know is there a team that you've built around you to help build a specific plan on backing out of some of these issues right we have a lot of money floating around that should be brought back into the government should be given back to dc to washington as you know there's a lot of money given out over the last couple of years especially over the last my money was given out to help us with covet then they took money and they have no idea what they're even doing with it that money can be given back and it should be given back and things can be done with that money that a positive but we have there are many many things i'll give you an example uh education we spend more on education per pupil than any other country we spend numbers that are and yet we're terrible at it we're down at the bottom of the list and yet we're at the top of the list i would give i am going to very early in the administration we're going to send education back to the states we're going to give them approximately half the number of dollars and they're going to have so much money that like they've never had before because they can spend a fraction of what we're spending right now and have much better school systems as an example you go to very you could name many you go to nebraska you go to iowa you go to many states we'll do a far better job that we're doing right now and they'll do it for a fraction of the cost we'll save a tremendous amount of money and have better some states i don't believe we'll do a very good job but they're going to have to learn to but we have uh i would say most of our states will do a much better job i think all of them will do better than you can't do worse than what we're doing right now but all of them will do better but some will be absolutely education a factory in a positive sense factories we are going to close up education we'll have a tiny little group to make sure everyone's teaching at least english and perhaps proper math etc etc but very little department of education goes and education goes back to the states and where it belongs i mean where it absolutely belongs and you're going to save a lot of money you can look at interior with that you can look at environmental with a lot of that where the environment can be controlled by the states instead of this big bureaucracy in washington dc i mean what do you do when china is burning all the coal and they're sending the they're sending the ashes over the united states because that's what happens takes three and a half days and it blows over the united states in the meantime we're keeping things good we produce clean coal we're going to produce clean energy but we have to get back to energy we're spending trillions of dollars on artificial weak energy that's not going to fire up our plants our plants have to be fired up we have a phenomena coming up right now and i was talking about it the other day to david and that's ai little things simple two little simple letters but it's big and i realized the other day more than anything when we were at david's house and talking to a lot of geniuses from silicon valley and other places they need electricity at levels that nobody's ever experienced before to have to be successful to be a leader in ai the amount of electricity that is like double what we have right now and even triple what we have right now they are they are it's incredible how much they need to be the leader and we're gonna have to be able to do that and a windmill turning with its blade knocking out the birds and everything else is not going to be able to make us competitive you'll have china what about what about nuclear mr president yeah so let me just give you a statistic 150 nuclear reactors and they're only spending about twenty five hundred dollars a kilowatt in the u.s we're not building any and our cost to build them is about ten thousand bucks a kilowatt and china's about to build as much capacity as twenty percent of the total u.s production in nuclear we clearly have a problem here in nuclear we do and nuclear is okay with me and what we're doing is you know if you look at alabama you look at a couple of states where they built these plants and they had cost overruns that are nobody's ever seen anything like it where they're costing 25 billion dollars to build a plant there were a couple of them built in the south i won't mention the places but you know the places and they came out at numbers that i think the most expensive things ever built in our country and the inspectors would go in they say those walls aren't thick enough knock them down and build another wall and you know the environmental people were brutal you know in france and in other places where they do have a lot of nuclear they build small plants all the same and if they need double the amount they'll build two of them as opposed to the nonsense that we've done where we build these massive plants and they never get built and they have cost overruns of of three four five hundred percent nobody's ever seen anything like it no i'm okay with nuclear but you have to do it in a way that makes sense and they they have nuclear applications today that can be built and can be built reasonably inexpensively but nuclear certainly is very strong power can i shift the conversation to foreign policy just for a minute just make sure we get we get time to talk about foreign policy is that okay with you guys yes mr president i really appreciate your your comments saying that you want to bring a peace deal to the war in ukraine so that people stop dying and i wholeheartedly agree with with that sentiment but i've seen that emmanuel macron the president of france is talking about actually putting nato troops or french troops in ukraine as potentially a next step and that could be a trip wire for more nato troops coming in can you guarantee that no matter what you're not going to put american boots on the ground in ukraine is that something you can say definitively i would guarantee it i wouldn't do it no it's different for france you know their neighbors more or less we have an ocean in between it's different for germany although germany is much less involved than they should be and other countries but uh you know we have a big ocean in between one of the things i think is so unfair david i think it's terrible is that we're giving probably we're at least a hundred billion dollars more than europe meaning europe as as a whole put together and the economies are similar size believe it or not that put together and us is about a very similar economy size but it's much more important for them it's important for everyone you have to have look this would have never happened if i were president it would have never put would have never done it and it happened for two reasons it also happened because oil went through the roof and he had he had all this money to prosecute the war but the oil was at a much lower level the price of oil he wouldn't have been able to afford the war all of a sudden when it hit almost a hundred dollars a barrel he said you know i mean he's one of the few to make money during a war because the oil has gone and it stayed very high it's extremely high right now and it's going up oil prices all over the country are going up as you probably have noticed but i will tell you that would have never happened ukraine would have never happened the israeli attack would have never happened and inflation would have never happened those are three big things inflation would have never happened but with ukraine and now it's very much uh look ukraine is now i read the other day where they don't have the soldiers they don't have the manpower they want to use children they want to use old people very old people people that are not really perhaps uh equipped to fight uh they're not the average age of their soldier is like 43 now so they're running out of they're literally running out of people to make a peace deal there would you be willing to take nato expansion off the table if that's what it took to get the russians and the ukrainians to make a deal would you be willing to do that though for 20 years i heard that nato if ukraine goes into nato it's a real problem for russia i've heard that for a long time and i think that's really why this war started i'm not sure that this war would have started uh biden was saying all of the wrong things and one of the wrong things he was saying no ukraine will go into nato that's one of the many things he said when i listened to him speak i said this guy is going to start a war because as you know for four years there was never even talk of russia going into ukraine that would have never happened russia was not going to attack ukraine as soon as i got out they started to form along the lines and i thought that putin maybe wilk he's a good negotiator i thought he was going to be doing that for negotiation purposes then all of a sudden they attacked and i said what's going on here but if you look at the rhetoric from biden uh he was saying the opposite of what in my opinion you had to say the things he was saying and he's still saying it he's saying things that are so crazy inflammatory yeah i 100 agree and you know it turns out that the month before the russians invaded blinkin told lavrov that the administration was not only going to bring ukraine into nato but that they thought it was okay for the united states to put nuclear weapons in ukraine so no wonder the russians hit the roof i mean you talk about uh provocation well let's say you were running russia you wouldn't be too happy and that's always been off the table you know there it's a border and it's always been that you know i don't think that they would have if they thought that that was going to remain sort of a territory where you don't have nato but they don't want to have soldiers right on their border they don't want to have it it's always been understood and that's even before putin it's always been understood that that was a no-no and now you can go against their wishes and it doesn't mean they're right when they say that but that was very provocative and now it's even more provocative and they're talking about uh i hear routinely they're now talking about ukraine entering nato and now i hear france wants to go in a fight well i wish him a lot of luck i think good luck so can i ask you about israel palestine so after october 7th what's the right path to just resolve this once and for all and just move forward again it's so sad to me because it would have never happened iran was broke they had no money i sanctioned countries that wanted to buy oil from iran and i would have made a fair deal with iran i was going to get along with iran i was going to get along with everybody we did the abraham accords i think eventually iran would have been in the abraham accords we had four strong countries go in and nobody went in since i got out that whole thing should have been loaded up right now would have it should have been full they did nothing with the abraham accords that everybody said were great they said we're going to get the ultimate prize because of that it was amazing if anybody else did it if a democrat did it they would have they would have gotten what they would have gotten every prize in the book every prize in the book but i did it and it was a great thing that we did it was a phenomenal thing but when you look at what happened now and you see what's going on it's very very very very sad that attack would have never happened in a million years iran didn't have the money for hamas they didn't have the money for hezbollah they didn't have the money for any of the 28 other cells of terror or whatever you want to call them iran was broke i say respectfully they had no money and they weren't given money and actually it was a big story when i was uh toward the end of my term there was a lot of big stories that there was no terror going on because iran didn't have the money they had to survive we would have made a deal good for everybody everybody would have been happy the main thing is iran can't have a nuclear weapon that was my main thing the deal was a simple deal iran can't have a nuclear you know it can't have a missile can't have a nuclear missile it cannot have that nuclear capability other than that we talk about everything they would have been very happy it would have been fine and you would have had peace in the middle east the problem is i had them at a point where you could have negotiated a child could have made a deal with them and biden did nothing he did nothing a child like to negotiate a young man that do nothing or a young woman that do nothing in kindergarten could have made a deal with iran at that time because they wanted to make a deal and biden never took advantage of it now they put back no sanctions all of the different things that they gave them china buys billions and billions of dollars of oil every month many billions of dollars a month other people are buying so iran now has 250 billion dollars cash they made it all in three and a half years and now they're much tougher to deal with and i will tell you i got along great with kim jong-un we solved that problem nobody was in danger but this is a big problem this is a real problem and within 90 days or so they're going to have and could have very well a nuclear weapon and israel is a big is a big difference in israel between iran with a nuclear weapon and iran without a nuclear weapon and lots of luck in that negotiation that's going to be a much more difficult negotiation president trump i i wanted to ask you a question about roe v wade you promised uh your base that you would overturn roe v wade you added three people to the supreme court and you delivered on that promise this might be the issue that determines the election and many people believe it is are you going to do a national abortion ban would you support that yes or no so i don't need a national ban because it's up to the states right now what i did is something that people have wanted to do for from day 151 years it's been going on and if you remember over the years you're too young but over the years all they wanted to do is they wanted to make take it out of the federal government and move it into the states and i got that done with the selection of three great justices i got it done and it was a big thing but i will say over the last 10 years or maybe a little bit more than that they started talking about the number of weeks and this and that a lot of different subjects came in it was no longer just simply bringing it back every legal scholar from democrat to republican liberal conservative they all wanted it brought given to the states because from a legal standpoint from a lot of other standpoints including even a moral standpoint they wanted it brought back to the states and what i did is i got it back to the states and now the states are in charge and the people are voting and some votes are coming out the way certain people wanted and some votes aren't coming out the way certain people wanted i mean if you look at ohio i would say it was a more liberal vote than people would have thought and you could say that for kansas and then you look at texas it was a different story but the people of the states have got that issue now and they're voting and the one thing that we have to remember that there's been a lot of radicalism talked about and the radicalism is really on the left because they're willing to do abortions in the eighth and ninth month month and even beyond that i mean we have some people the governor take a look at the governor of virginia the former governor of virginia where he talked about we will kill the baby after the baby is born that's a very radical stance and hopefully that's all going to be taken off the table now but just to put it simply it's now up to the states and like ronald reagan i'm a believer in the exceptions the three exceptions as you know and rape incest life of the mother uh the danger for the life of the mother and we have a situation now where it's in the state's hands and the states are going to be voting the last thing people want the people are going to be voting the last thing people want is for that to go back into the federal government it was always fought and very importantly and people wanted it they wanted it back in the states where it belongs legally and for a lot of other reasons so you wouldn't support a national ban no i wouldn't support a national ban no i would not just shifting back to foreign policy for a moment mr president on the relationship with china it's funny how democrats and republicans seem to have a unified voice and banging the drums on the the rise of china do you think that war with china is inevitable and if not how do we avoid it i think it's not inevitable i think it's unlikely i know president xi very well and we got a long great until covid then i wasn't so happy with him because they gave it to us i said it came from the wuhan lab i was right about that they said then it started in italy and then it started in france it started everywhere but there but it started in china and it was a many many millions of people died all over the world and cost the world probably 60 trillion dollars which is more money than china has and more money than anybody has the death and destruction has been unbelievable but i think it's i think it's high if you have the right president uh we can live at peace with china we can do very well with china compete with china but we don't have the right president right now he's not respected by china he's being laughed at by china and he's a manchurian candidate i mean he's received money from china his family and that makes him to me uh somebody that shouldn't be negotiating he's got a conflict of interest uh but no i don't see war with china as being inevitable at all president trump do you think that fauci and our government funded gain of function research and do you think we should really be pursuing the investigation deeply into that and if we did fund gain of function research what does that say about our government and taking ownership of it because a lot of us lost a lot of years kids didn't go to school and uh it caused economic damage as you pointed out earlier the amount of money you had to spend to try to avoid a depression was really severe and if we funded that what does that make you think about our government and then fauci covering it up if that is in fact true what does that make you think about our government so if you remember i'm the one that stopped it and i stopped it maybe for a lucky reason or an unusual reason i said why are we paying money to china it wasn't about gain of function or anything else it was why are we paying money to china china got a lot of money and they're doing fine you know we're considered like uh they want us to consider them a growing nation a nation in distress all sorts of things because they always take advantage of every treaty by saying that they need you know they're uh an improving nation i heard the other day they have all different terms for changing but they're a growing nation well we're a growing nation too we're a nation that's becoming a third world nation based on what we're seeing but i was the one that stopped that when i saw that i was the one that stopped that the fauci thing is an interesting phenomena uh he's a much i was not a big fan of his as you know he said no let everybody come in from china i overrode him on that i overrode him on a lot but he wanted the people from china when i heard about this i stopped it we had a room loaded up with people and nobody could even believe it but i stopped it we would have lost hundreds of thousands of people more maybe more much more maybe over the millions but hundreds of thousands of people more had i not stopped people coming in from china did he lie to you about the origin of coven well i've always said the origin was uh you know where it came from where it originally came from was the wuhan lab i happen to think it escaped from the wuhan lab i mean i don't believe it came from uh the bats in 2 000 miles away caves i don't believe it came from other countries as china tried to convince people it did uh i thought it should have been called the china virus because it was a very much more accurate term than covet nobody knows what covet even means why is it covet uh but uh no i was always uh but did fauci lie to you i guess is what the american people want to know did fauci lie to you and if he did should he be prosecuted i don't think uh i dealt you have to understand fauci was a much bigger factor in the biden administration than he was in the trump administration i didn't rely on him that much because i didn't trust him uh i would say got along with him fine not really but i didn't trust him and again i was the one that stopped the money going to china i didn't like it i didn't stop it because of covet i didn't stop it because of anything other than why are we paying money to china it was strange they should pay us money we shouldn't pay them money one of the things i can tell you the world health organization so we pay them almost 500 million dollars and china pays them 39 million dollars and so i got out of the world health organization they did absolutely nothing they called it totally wrong i got out they called me and they said we'll do anything to keep you in anything anything i said well why are they paying 39 million we're paying almost 500 million and they said well we'll work out a deal where you can pay much less i said well now you're starting to talk but even that it was very popular when i got out it was a very politically it would have been very hard to go back in people were thrilled that i got out i could have made a deal to go in for 39 million they offered me a deal to go in for 39 million and i actually turned it down i said you know it should be a third it should be if you look at we're 350 million they're there at 1.4 billion people right so it should have been 25 or less than that but i didn't want to quibble but i could have gone back in immediately for 39 million dollars as opposed to 500 then a horrible horrible election which helped destroy our country took place in 2020 and they went back in and they're paying more than 500 million dollars and they knew i could have made a deal now it's a lot of money not when you talk about the world but it's still a lot of money in it but it shows you the stupidity of the whole thing they could have made a deal for 39 million instead they're paying much more than they paid even before and that's the way the mindset of our country is and here's the big part china totally controls the who china totally controls them we have very little control over them and now they want to give control over a whole country to them which would be a terrible mistake fauci brings up sort of the kind of deep state personality that you talked about in 2016 that's kind of like riddled all over the government how much progress do you think you made and how what do you want to do if you become president november and do you have goals around the deep state this time around and what are they well i have a lot of things i mean i did a lot of things in the fbi i fired a lot of their top people including comey who's terrible at what he did a terrible person and terrible at what he did uh i fired mccabe and you know i don't have to go through lisa and struck you know all of the lovers and i fired the whole group of people i got rid of them and uh and you know so many of the agents are so incredible in the fbi down below but uh we got rid of a lot we uh you take a look at the world health again we got out of the world health we got out of the this is a similar thing that you know this is really similar to your answer but we got out of the world health organization which was a tremendous thing we got rid of the paris accord the paris accord was a disaster for us we were going to pay a trillion dollars and other countries were paying nothing russia was paying nothing china was paying nothing it didn't even kick in for china until 2030 whereas with us it kicked in immediately so i got rid of the paris accord i did a lot of things having to do with not only people but tremendous amounts of money because the paris accord was so unfair and i said you know when i do this people are not going to like it but i have to do it because it's right people loved it the public understood it they loved it and now they've gone back into the paris accord at the same terms and even worse than the terms i got out it's really a shame it's so many things it's so sad to see so many things i i mean the who the paris accord you take a look at these things they could have gone back if they wanted to go back if they had it they could have gone back for a fraction of what they were doing and they're very unfair to the united states we're like a lap dog for every other country mr president i know you're running out of time here so about we haven't had a chance to for you to speak to the border situation yet so i want to give you a chance to to address that because that's always been really one of the your main issues since always since 2016 you wanted to build a wall the democrats everything they could to thwart that you built the wall but then biden left a bunch of holes in it and then sold off the parts for scrap metal and now we've had the pro and repealed your executive order so i want to give you a chance to speak to that just but one piece i want to just add in as a follow-up question is a lot of tech ceos say uh if we fix the border can we get more h1 b's for tech workers so can you address that as well as what's going on at the border yes so we built hundreds of miles of wall david as you know and we're very proud of it we did it as per specification by the border patrol they wanted exactly the wall that we did with the climb paddle on top with steel concrete and then rebar and all of the things that they wanted they wanted to have vision through it clearly through it and because i thought about concrete plank frankly going up 40 or 50 feet and they they didn't like that they wanted to have vision through and i understood that too uh i sort of disagreed with it but that's okay we actually brought climbers in mount everest climbers to climb and and we built a very hard wall to climb it's a very effective wall uh and we built uh hundreds of miles and then we were going to add quite a bit at the very end and we we bought about 200 additional miles and it was ready to be put up could have been put up in three weeks maybe four weeks and areas that were rough areas that were people coming in because as you build the wall they go in different areas right they go further out uh the it was so effective it was so effective mexico gave us a lot of troops for free because of a certain negotiation that i had with them you heard that but it was so effective the wall but biden they didn't want to put up those slats that were going up routinely by us that means you had gaps you had as an example you had gates in certain area that we put up we were going to put up big powerful gates that we could open and uh you could let equipment through etc etc if you needed it and they got rid of everything they sold it for five cents on the dollar much of it five cents on the dollar i said i can't believe it and that's the first time that i said they're serious they actually want open borders they want an open border nobody could believe it i couldn't believe it because i never believed they wanted an open border because who would be stupid enough to want an open border look what's happened with an open border i was very proud of that we built we had the safest border in the history of our country and now we have the worst border in the history of the world we had a safe border i had a remain in mexico policy uh catch and release in mexico not in the united states everything was so good but the remain in mexico was a big deal not easy to get but it was a big deal they were in tijuana hundreds of thousands of people they had to be approved to come into our country and now you look at what's happened we've been overrun it's an invasion of our country by people many people come out of jails and prisons they come out of mental institutions insane asylums and we have terrorists coming into our country at a level that we've never seen before it's a very sad i never understood why the wall was so controversial you know every country needs to have a border and a wall is a really good way to enforce a border i never understood why they were so animated about stopping you from building the wall after you ran on that issue in 2016 they held you up for years with litigation and then like you said they wouldn't just finish the little pieces of it and they left big holes in it and i think you're right the only conclusion is they want an open border i mean how else do you explain it they want to destroy our country you know the fact is it's it's incredible the big mistake i made i should have said i will not build a wall we do not want a wall and that wall would have gone up in 15 minutes the more important point i think mr president is we need high skilled workers in this country yes we need to recruit the best and brightest from the world every time we get somebody super intelligent from india or europe any country that's one of our immigrants sir yeah and three of the four here are immigrants um the ones without the ties and we can get these great people into our country and that's a loss for our adversaries and our competitors and it's a game for us but i've never heard you talk about this can you please promise us you will give us more ability to import the best and brightest around the world to america i do promise but i happen to agree that's why i promise otherwise i wouldn't promise let me just tell you that it's so sad when we lose people from harvard m.i.t.</p><p>from the greatest schools and lesser schools that are phenomenal schools also and what i wanted to do and i would have done this but then we had to solve the covid problem because that came in and you know sort of dominated for a little while as you perhaps know but what i want to do and what i will do is you graduate from a college i think you should get automatically as part of your diploma a green card to be able to stay in this country and that includes junior colleges too anybody graduates from a college you go in there for two years or four years if you graduate or you get a doctorate degree from a college you should be able to stay in this country and you know more stories than i do but i know of stories where people graduated from a top college or from a college and they desperately wanted to stay here they had a plan for a company a concept and they can't they go back to india they go back to china they do the same basic company in those places and they become multi-billionaires employing thousands and thousands of people and it could have been done here and a bigger example is you that you need a pool of people to work for your companies you have great companies and they have to be smart people not everybody can be uh less than smart you need brilliant people and we force the brilliant people the people that graduate from college the people that are number one in their class from the best colleges you have to be able to recruit these people and keep the people it was such a big deal somebody graduates at the top of the class they can't even make a deal with the company because they don't think they're going to be able to stay in the country that is going to end on day one that's fantastic yeah that's great well i think we all wholeheartedly agree with that being in the being in the tech industry we understand the importance of that they're telling us that you have to go to dinner mr president so thank you so much for spending so much time with us we really appreciate it it's been great having this conversation i'm sorry i have to ask one question sir when you got elected in 20 in the 2016 election you said the first thing or one of the things you wanted to do was release the jfk file and then you said later i saw it and i just i wasn't really ready to do it and then i saw a clip where you changed your mind and you said i think we're ready to see this file and i'm just curious what's in it what i don't know what happened like what i actually did do it i released a lot as you know but when it came to the whole thing i was hit by some people that worked for me that are great people that you would respect and they asked me not to do it and i'm saying why tell me why and they said sir i think it needs a little more time and i released a lot but i said if they feel so strongly i respect the people and would would have done that again but this time i'm just going to do it rfk says the cia killed his his uncle do you believe that well this wasn't cia that asked me but i think cia was probably behind it but they didn't they would have preferred that i not release the rest of it so we we did give quite a bit uh it's going to be done early on a lot of people want to see that and whatever it may say i won't say i sort of have an idea but uh whatever it is it'll be very interesting for people to see and we're going to have to learn from it promise us you'll come back again you know there are other things we're going to release too we're going to release what what else do you got we'll talk to you about it off aliens by the way i generally speaking and there are reasons not to release certain things obviously but i generally you know it's transparency and i i think it's important that we release that and there are other things too there are other things that you know about but people more than anything else they want the jfk files we're going to release that immediately you have a prediction for the debate next week what's going to happen well all i can say is this i watched him with paul ryan and he destroyed paul ryan paul ryan with the water he was chugging water at a left and right i didn't think a human being would be able to drink so much water at one time and he beat paul ryan so i'm not underestimating him i'm not underestimating him we it is what it is uh we'll see what happens but you take a look at the last one uh i happen to think he's incompetent for a lot of reasons i think he's incompetent because he has gotten the worst policies both foreign policy and internal policy i mean who would not want to have a wall who wants to have millions of people pouring in who wants to have high taxes you know taxes are going to raise by four times if this guy has this plan is he in cognitive decline do you believe he's in cognitive decline mr president i shouldn't be the one to say that but i don't think he's doing particularly well but i didn't think he was well 25 years ago i thought he was not a smart person and that was told to me by a certain member of the kennedy family who was actually very friendly with me through a palm beach relationship and he i was told that very strongly but so i was never a fan of his but i will say he beat uh he beat paul ryan it was still years ago but he beat paul ryan pretty badly and uh i assume he's going to be somebody that will be a worthy debater yeah i would say i think i don't want to underestimate him all right i think that's smart well your your team is telling us that uh they need you to go to a dinner mr president obviously we could keep going for hours and hours but it's been great we could uh it's been great uh great to have you for the last hour here and it's been great to getting to know you with the dinner that we did and we hope that you'll come back on our show podcasts are getting bigger and bigger so hopefully in your second term you'll come on here uh and uh talk to us again i think biden would do this interview i don't absolutely not i don't think so one question i don't think he's doing these interviews so that's it's an honor to be with you all very good question we appreciate it sir thank you very much sir thank you thank you sir there you have it wow that was some hour boys what do we think let's do a wrap up huh okay do a do a little wrap here whoo jk what are your what are your big takeaways well i'm undecided as you know we did we had a limited amount of time with him and obviously i'll just say it just say you like him you didn't you were just say it just say it because it's written all across your face just say you like him you're confused i have some questions no he crushed your questions you asked great questions and he just dealt with them head on just admit it you like him you like him i told you you'd like this is my point whether you whether you come out of it wanting to vote for the president or not sure everybody needs to i think just sit in a room and just hear him out if you're if you if you want me to answer the question what i'll say is there there are some blockers i have that we didn't get to january 6 obviously i did you know one of the blockers i have is obviously roe v wade and i think he handled that question really well and i think we may have gotten a little bit of breaking news there in terms of him saying he would not do the national ban and i think that's a big concern people have and i think that's maybe the issue according to a lot of experts i'm starting to sound like i have a lot of experts people believe that could be the deciding issue uh of the election and so i think he handled it really well by saying the states are going to choose and he's not going to do the federal exemption he was very unequivocal about that really clear that he would not do a national ban really clear that the states would decide and furthermore he understood that the states are deciding there's been a bunch of referenda at the state level and they are generally coming out on the pro-choice side and he indicated that he understood that some of the votes are not turning out the way the people which is what 80 percent of people want right 80 percent of people he's going to respect democracy yeah he's going to respect democracy on that issue yeah so i think he he nailed that that question i think he was very definitive about ukraine not entering nato and i think he was very definitive about an h1b policy that's pro productivity and immigration that was the part i like best if i'm being giving grads green cards that's like such a that's breaking news too by the way i think we elevated the discussion about immigration beyond the wall and into recruitment which is what i have been trying to do on this podcast for a couple years here now so to hear the president say i will do that for you because i want that that to me was palatable and you know there's a lot of things i agree with him on and the january 6th up we didn't get to so apologies to the audience on that i know a lot of people have feelings about it but you know you can only get so much from 50 minutes of interview i think you did a great job the whole town hall on that issue i mean quite frankly i felt like we dealt with a lot of substance here so but chamath i agree with you he was really clear on ukraine he went further than he has in the past in the past he said that he'll get a peace deal very quickly and then he wants the people to stop dying but in this interview he went further he said that if france or other european countries send in troops the u.s definitely will not participate in that we are not going to send american boots on the ground the biden administration i don't think has said that definitively the way that president trump said it moreover he understood that a major cause of the war was the desire to bring ukraine into nato and i've never heard i've never heard anyone in the administration say that and he went further and said they keep saying these provocative things about you know even now they keep repeating that ukraine's gonna be part of nato so he understood he understood the provocation there faber where's your take on him you haven't come out and said who you're voting for but this is your first time interacting with him i'll be it for 50 minutes in a group setting but what are you what's your impression it's a diff it's a difficult forum because we can't go deep and ask responsive questions and we don't have a lot of time and there's four of us trying to ask questions so the format is a little difficult to get to the heart of the matter on some of these complicated topics like federal spending yeah we need two hours dead yeah and and i think you need to just be able to like hone in on the question you know his response on how are we going to reduce kind of the bureaucratic overhead and the wasteful spending and the federal government and he kind of pivoted to the department of education that's three percent of the federal budget i want to talk about the rest of it and you know we're at it took us 200 years as a country to add a trillion dollars to our federal debt to go from zero to a trillion and now we're adding a trillion every hundred days and it's going to take a lot more than just one to three percent cuts in spending to get us out of the you know the spiral that we're in i also am concerned very um i think very rightly so and i think he acknowledges the concerns that were mentioned by larry summers that tariffs plus tax cuts could lead to uh serious inflation and economic contraction those are really difficult things to do together unless you have a very clear plan for massively cutting spending at the federal level so i don't feel like i got to the heart of the matter on those points and as you guys know that's what i care so deeply about i think we need to fix the machine to be able to do the things we want the machine to do over time and i'm very deeply worried about that you know i had a couple of reactions to that so number one is i thought it was interesting how he reacted to the question about larry summers because he knows larry summers and he actually said several very things towards him so he may not agree with him on everything but he said that larry had gotten a bunch of things right and he's an interesting guy and and larry did get the inflation call right remember at the very beginning right of the biden administration so it was interesting i thought that president trump handled that question very tactfully i think it's not like do we wasn't looking to attack anyone or anything like that we really buy he's going to do this terrorist thing anyway like it seems like that's a bit of pandering maybe to the voter base it sounds like a great solution right but i don't think he's going to do it yeah once the economic advisors get together and look at the analysis and what this will do to costs of things inflation will go up etc you know maybe there's a rethink ultimately on how that's implemented and on what particular slices of the economy it's implemented so i'm sure as you point out it probably gets toned down for this to you know to even become a reality uh it seems yeah just on the on the second piece on the the deficit you know jake how you asked a pretty tough question there where you basically said look your your your depth the debt has grown as much under your first term as it does under biden remember that the eight trillion i mean it's almost exactly going to be the same 6.5 to date from biden 7.8 trillion but i think he had a pretty good answer which was that look at the first year of covid we were dealing with you know a depression a potential depression yeah you mentioned that the economy gdp was down 30 yeah he talked about 1929 yeah yeah exactly so he basically explained that we had to do that but then after that we shouldn't have kept going and i do think that trump is just not as big a spender as biden i mean look biden's been in washington for 50 years he thinks government's the answer for everything he loves spending money and he spent trillions on covid even after we didn't need to so i get the sense that trump was a reluctant spender i'm not saying he didn't spend whereas biden i think is a eager spender and yeah i think i think any modern politician wants to spend because it's popular i just think it's their nature i think if trump had the power by himself to rein in spending i think he would i think the issue is that the president by himself can't do that much which is what my follow-up question was right i was trying to ask him can you actually do it as president or not like is there the wherewithal to do it i think the other aspect i wanted to see i'm really glad he talked about de-dollarization and i he mentioned it up front and so that to me really resonated it really rings true to the effect of u.s spending u.s foreign policy so much of this is driving and i'm concerned about right driving the saudis into the arms of the chinese and and other foreign adversaries to the united states and i would have really liked to have spent a little time with him on the saudi relationship where he sees that headed how the saudi relationship will affect the middle east and how the saudi relationship could affect the u.s dollar and and dollar reserves around the world but i think he's acutely aware of de-dollarization and uh foreign reserves in dollars being sold down and that the there are serious effects to that i didn't hear a follow-up on like what the specific responses will be uh you know to to the drivers there which i i would have loved to spend a little more time off what do you think will be the viral moments to come out of this if any what do you think the mainstream media or social media will take from this any moments you think we're breaking news or notable well i think there's a lot of clarity on a couple of important points one is no federal ban on abortion i think that that's important news for a lot of people the second is this clarity on h1 bs which is very different from what has to be done at the border and i think that was very clear and new and i think it's very positive for our community meaning the tech absolutely i think yeah that's why we we need that clarity because we're trying to hire these people and we are losing them every day and then the third was i think the clarity on nato was also very definitive and i think that that's important the fourth which was an implication of what he said which is a little depressing is i think there's a lot of us that want to see this is really palestine conflict resolved and i think what he's saying is we can't because we've let the genie out of the bottle we have an adversary now with a quarter of a trillion dollars of excess cash who has no incentive to negotiate iran that's iran so that's really depressing and then the fifth one was around this jfk thing i the reason why i asked the jfk question is not necessarily that i have a specific interest in jfk but it's emblematic of it's a proxy for this deep state this idea of secrets or this idea of there's a layer of people that are embedded in the united states government that decides on behalf of all of us and i think when you have somebody who can push back against that and use transparency and sunlight as the cleansing function that is what we need if we're going to rebuild trust in our government and institutions we're going to need a lot more transparency and if that one's hanging out there why not resolve it i mean i did he say he thinks the cia cia did it i think i heard him say that i think what i heard was he said the people that were influencing him not to know i think what he said was we should be clear about that because it could be it could be quoted out of context we're going to need to see the transcript on that he did not say that he thought the cia he did not say he didn't come anywhere close right he said that he thought the cia was behind influence that we're telling him yeah to not do it and he listened to them out of trust and respect for them which i think that's a reasonable judgment in the moment but my point is that transcript my point is exposing that is a very important way of giving the influence and power back to the people you know i've mentioned this quote from mike pompeo which is really powerful but it's something to the effect of you know the people on the top floor of the cia do not believe it's a democrat or a republican that runs america but that they do and he said that in the context of being asked what is the one regret you have or some of the biggest regrets you have in running the cia and pompeo said that he didn't fix that so i think that there's a lot of embedded versions of this establishment class that lurk in many institutions whether it's the epa whether it's the cia whether it's the nih and if there are ways in which the president can unlock the data that's necessary or the information for all of us to have a little bit more clarity on what's happening i think it's important and i think for many people that the gfk file is representative of a lot of well and then dovetailing that sacks the fauci discussion where he said i don't trust i didn't i never trusted fauci and then kind of pushing it on like hey do you think it should be prosecuted did we fund it or not seems pretty clear he believes we funded gain of research his position was i just didn't want to spend the money which i appreciate about it with china with china yeah spend the money in china yeah yeah and so what did you think of that point yeah well i i thought that his response on that was similar to a lot of his responses which is he did not take the edgy position that he was sort of being teed up to take i mean kind of like same thing with like the larry summers thing you know he he had mild criticism i thought for fauci but he didn't go scorched earth at all on fauci there and trust him he said yeah absolutely nobody nobody nobody trusts fauci you asked him whether fauci should be prosecuted he did not take the bait on that that's my he was very respectful actually i was very surprised to hear how he respected fauci and how he framed the his response to that question and i think that says a lot but can i tell you why you're surprised because i think we have been fed this is what i'm saying we have been fed a narrative of what president trump looks like now in fairness we're also being fed a narrative of what president biden is like and this is why you have to see these men up close and personal for yourself because david the fact that you're surprised is less about the fact that donald trump has changed right it's more the fact that you've been told a narrative and you've believed it and so now when you see the actual truth you have to re-underwrite hold on a second he's actually pretty thoughtful he's pretty presidential he doesn't go off on people that's not what you probably thought going in because that's not what the mainstream media portrays about what you should be thinking about in fairness he has gone in on people pretty hard over the last eight years he's a counter puncher i don't think he hits people unless they hit him first i mean that's his pattern but look i i agree with chamath here that my overall take on this and look my position is is clear because i wrote a long post on x endorsing trump a couple weeks ago but everything i heard here in this interview was consistent with the reasons why i stated i want to support him he clearly favors a pro-growth agenda he wants to keep taxes low or and reasonable he wants to reduce regulations he wanted to increase the number of h1b's get the dream team over here for tech while sealing the border while cutting down on crime in blue cities he talked about how crime was out of control he wants to negotiate peace deals he i think understands very well why we have this war going on in europe overall i heard a lot of reassuring things and i didn't hear anything that i would put in the category of a grievance or a desire for revenge you know the media is trying to portray him as like seeking vengeance or something like that well that's because he says he is didn't get didn't get that over and over again let's be clear he said over again i will be your retribution so he may not have said it on this podcast did you get any of that in this interview no i've just heard him say it 50 times in the last 60 days so but sax where would you like to have seen him be maybe the same clip played over and over again on where would you like to have seen him be stronger or different on any of his major positions what would you as his advisor advise him to shift or double down on a bit well i mean i think jamaath is right that with respect to the middle east the i think his position isn't perfectly clear because it's not only about iran in the middle east right um yeah but the truth of the matter is politically i don't know that he could say more and you know i think that's just a very very tough issue where you're bound to alienate and polarize one side of the other and so i think he's sort of definitely walking a tightrope there yeah when he says it would never have happened like i'm always like you know like it would never happen to me i would like to have a little more of the why why do you believe that and he never gets into the details he just says that over and over but maybe he's right you know like when i hear maybe talk what i hear is someone who's a deal maker he was a deal maker in business now he's a deal maker politically he's willing to have conversations with anybody there was even a moment when he's talking about iran where he said maybe he could have worked out a deal um but in any event he's somebody who i think is willing to negotiate which i think is a positive thing because once last time biden negotiated anything he doesn't seem interested at all i mean i didn't get to ask but you know one of the things i had chewed up was you know i just think you've done a phenomenal job in talking to people who most people feel are difficult people to get along with you know kim jong-un g putin i think it's a superpower is talking to dictators despots people who are cantankerous and difficult and he always seems to get the better of them or at least get he at least gets our interests as americans aligned with whatever their interests are so i think let me ask you give him a plus on that yeah i don't want to be insulting i'm asking like in the past you said that he was embracing the dictators and he was kowtowing to that i think you've said comments like that in the past where no i don't know if i said yes or something that felt like he was more trying to embrace and engage with them in a way that's like why i've always felt you should talk to everybody all the time um you know that that's not my issue with trump you know it's never been an issue with him i think that's a superpower the fact that he went into north korea and stepped over in the dmz you saw the look on kim jong-un's face he just kim jong-un just wants a little attention he wants a little recognition and this idea like we're not going to give him any recognition is stupid because if you give him a little recognition now you're sort of tilting him towards hey maybe you could be part of this like maybe you could come to the west and see a movie premiere or come to the nba finals as opposed to start lobbying you know dysfunctional missiles over japan like maybe we can kind of you know that video where they're like setting up the little press shooting in the in the conference room and he oh my god that video is smile on kim jong-un's face when trump says video you want me to go over i'll go should i go over should i do it now i'll go over okay i'm gonna walk and kim jong-un is beaming and you're like he just played him he played him like he walked 10 feet into north korea and now kim jong-un's like you know what i don't need this i guess my my big unanswered question i did want to ask him about like dalio's prediction of like the cycle of empires 500 years things that i was obsessed with that well let's play counterfactual freebrook what do you what do you how do you compare the answers you've heard to what you have heard or what you think president biden's answers would be to the things that you care about i honestly feel like there's a little bit of a blinders to the question like there's a pivot back to what i've done what i'll do versus the like let's actually talk about where we are in the debt cycle and this is exactly what like history repeating itself at the time that you take on all the debt you drive internal conflict january 6 is a great like data point you drive external conflict we've had two or three wars start in the last four years how do we reverse those things so that we don't repeat history and we sat down with dolly and we asked him this question is there a way to not repeat history and he said yes there is and we talked with graham allison about this and all these guys believe that there's a way to avoid it there have been moments where we've nearly had the external conflict and that's why i asked him about war with china but i want to understand if there is this broader kind of construct of what is going on because he he hits on all the data points correctly de-dollarization increased spending bloated bureaucracy conflicts around the world without taking it all into perspective and saying man like this is where empires die i guess he does say that right he he does actually highlight exactly what dalio doesn't do what he does though right like malay has said to the populace that's exactly yeah he just needs to take that next step and say i will cut half the people working at these places he kind of did say it when it came to education i don't know what your interpretations were gentlemen back to an entrepreneurial economy right allow capitalism i think he did say around regulation and then with respect to the bureaucracy he pointed to education yeah that was a good example energy he pointed to the epa the right things are on his radar screen you know uh i just hope he gets the right people around him sax like yeah i mean i need you and no more juliani's and stupid people you gotta if you're gonna put him put smart we need we need a cabinet cabinet and advisors here's a nuclear on the regulation and nuclear on ai like yeah in 2016 there was not the kind of people that for example were at this fundraiser that david and i organized was i think entirely different than what you saw in 2016 and i do think there is an opportunity where if you dipped your hand like there was a young man in the audience who answered this ai question and he talked about public key private key cryptography it was beautiful it was amazing very technical person but there are all these people that are coming out of the woodwork to your point free bird if he can figure out how to build a cabinet with those people meaning these extremely technical thoughtful people then there's a real shot that you can change i hope that's right i pulled up some some data going into our conversation i just want to read this to you guys totally off topic but i i just want to say we can cut it out if you want but you know construction for the francis scott key bridge which is 1.6 miles long when it was built in 1977 was 141 million bucks about 740 million in today's dollars today they're estimating to repair you know that's the bridge that collapsed in baltimore they're saying it's going to cost you know two billion dollars or more to repair that bridge now you know 40 years later california's bullet train project in 2008 was supposed to cost 40 billion we're 15 years into this thing we've spent 18 billion they're now asking for 140 billion total to build 171 mile track that's a billion a mile that's a billion a mile let me just tell you this other fact china tracks are in the middle of nowhere yeah and china just spent 300 billion to build 16 000 miles of high-speed rail they're spending 18 million a mile that's two percent of the cost of the california high-speed rail system two percent per mile we are 50 times more expensive than china that is where superpowers shift that is where that is the fundamental premise of the shift that we've seen five six times in the last 500 years that's the question yeah i mean is it just time to privatize all this stuff it's layers it's layers of you know yeah these two men trump or biden which one do you think is going to be more skeptical of big government spending and which one is going to be more interested in being conducive to the private sector solving problems i mean to me there's no comparison well which one which one do you think obviously trump is is his all of his instincts are let's empower the private sector let's cut regulations let's make taxes reasonable let's get the smartest people in the country let's have peace deals let's have growth what do you think friedberg i have heard conversations that there is an economic argument i don't know if i buy it that one of the reasons that they're trying to leave the border open is there is a um low cost labor pool that grows that actually is is beneficial to economic growth that um there's just not enough in the workforce today to like think about the cost of building that railroad in china versus the u.s you know the the average income in the u.s is is a a couple turns on what it is in china you can also say you don't want to answer the question between the two yeah man um ask this question more specifically yeah ask me yeah honestly who do you think is closer to your desired outcome trump or biden i i think trump hits on it like way more than biden does yeah he definitely hits on the concerns that i have i don't know if he has like the path that makes me feel like great let's you know like this is gonna work biden does biden and and i think the other thing i worry about is the leadership problem with trump meaning i don't mean him as a leader in terms of effectiveness but just this like trump derangement syndrome is not something to be ignored and to be disparaging of the people that we all you know that not we all the people say have trump derangement syndrome it's a fundamental like tilting that he does and he tilts half the people in the country he tilts them and i think that that is really and maybe the other side as well maybe it's a psychological problem that a lot of people have it doesn't mean we should have a worse president no so that's what that's one argument or yeah or maybe he when he tried maybe there's a way to use unifying speech instead of divisive speech and that is my other concern is just like or or you speak directly to the people and you end up where jake ellis at and where you're at which is you've heard him face to face really for the first time i want to hear biden face to face i want to have a long conversation we don't have none here we invited biden on here too and we're waiting breathlessly for him to accept the invitation you got to give trump credit for coming on the show like he said yeah and took all questions yeah so you got to give trump a lot of credit for that but freeberg to your point about the tds for a second look when biden ran in 2020 he promised a return to normalcy that was basically his sales pitch we had just gone through covet you know there were a lot of people who had tds who were tilted by trump and what biden said is we're gonna have normalcy what actually happened well i think biden began this incredibly partisan and vindictive program of lawfare of trying to prosecute not just trump but a lot of other people we had the border basically opened up i mean biden repealed all those executive orders on day one and did create those holes in the wall there was absolutely no reason for that we had this war in ukraine that was easily avoidable if they just said the right things back in 2021 and i mean i could go on i mean on on the issue of tech like we talked about everyone feels frozen right now crypto can't get a regulatory framework no one can do mna so have we gotten the normalcy that we were promised i don't think so and on the other hand what i heard from trump in this interview was like it was sort of softened he did not go scorched earth when even when he invited him to he did not say i will agree he did not he had nice words to say about larry summers yes he was you know i thought this was a very moderate sounding trump maybe it's a different approach and i'm wrong and i'm just referencing the history with him and i do agree with you that the way he spoke today about people that have been antagonistic about him or to him like larry summers and fauci did surprise me particularly after years of him sending out these tweets every morning about people that are antagonistic about him and it was quite refreshing honestly and it felt different so you know i will give him credit on that point i will i will like agree with you on that sex for sure the point is i think that we had an opportunity to interview the president of the united states and that was congrats i think we talked about a broad spectrum of issues i wish we had more time i think he answered them precisely and i think he was candid and i think that he gave us new information which i think is important and i think it allowed you guys to see what i saw which is if you're an independent or not a republican quote-unquote by name and you have a preconceived notion of what president trump is like it's very difficult to keep that notion is my point after you hear him and after you meet him and i think that that's a very important thing to keep in mind because i don't think it says as much about president trump as it does about the lens with which we are taught to think about all of these people including president biden so i would just say you got to think for yourself and that's the most important takeaway and i think that we are giving people ground truth data to underwrite your own opinion all right everybody this has been another amazing episode of the all in podcast thank you david sachs for getting president trump to come on president biden you are of course invited to come on we encourage you to come on give us 50 minutes give us an hour and a half whatever you got no we've asked we've asked we're waiting i'm just restating it for the record had if you by some means somebody in this group says we should you know talk to the all in team since they're a top 10 podcast and every other presidential candidates been on who knows maybe somebody decides he's going to be able to keep up with the group i don't think he can keep up that's the big challenge for the rain man david sachs chamath palihapitiya your chairman dictator and the sultan of science david rupert i am the world's greatest moderator you didn't moderate today i'm sure i guess sex great job we'll see you next time great job love you boys rain man david sachs and it said we open sources to the fans and they've just gone crazy with it love you queen of quinoa we should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they're all just useless it's like this like sexual tension that they just need to release somehow what you're about to be i'm doing all in you</p></div></div></body></html>
