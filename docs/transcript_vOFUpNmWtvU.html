I see a lot of that. It's a terrible idea because nobody wants your story to be wordsmith for them, right?</p><p>They want to get to the point, they want to get to the point. If I'm there to be entertained, okay, wordsmith me, make it fun. But if I want something from you, or you want something from me, can we just get to the point, right? Here's what it is.</p><p>Then you want to know how it works. Then once you understand it, you want to know, could that be real? Would that actually do what you think it is? Oh, yeah? Okay, well, how do I get that? Or how does this actually get there? Like, that's what a story builds, right?</p><p>That's how storytelling in Hollywood works. You inform people and lead them to the conclusion. That's all Hollywood storytelling is, is leading people to the conclusion you want.</p></div></div></body></html>
