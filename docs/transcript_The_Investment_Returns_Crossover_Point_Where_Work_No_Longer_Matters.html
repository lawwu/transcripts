And in this episode, we're going to talk about investment returns versus active income. And what happens when investment returns beat your active income every year. So I don't know about you folks, but I'm pretty tired. And I know a lot of people who are growing more and more apathetic to work, because they're tired, but also because their investment returns have been so good.</p><p>We've been in a bull market technically since 2009. So that's about 12 years of generally upward momentum, except for what 2018, maybe one more year, not so good. But in general, we've been making money every single year. And you might find that one day, your investment returns are greater than your annual active income.</p><p>And you're going to feel giddy and excited. But you're probably not going to quit your job just yet, just in case it was a fluke. However, after several years of investment returns surpassing your active income, you'll develop a lot more courage to do something new. You might finally ask for that well-deserved sabbatical without fear of your year-end bonus getting slashed.</p><p>You won't fear as much not getting that promotion because you got the investment returns. So who cares if the company screws you? Well, of course you will care because you obviously want to get what you deserve. But once those investment returns surpass your active income, it becomes harder and harder to care as much about your career.</p><p>And it becomes harder and harder to get as motivated. So that's where I find myself, folks, as I transition back to retirement by 2022, when there's hopefully herd immunity, although who knows, I've been trying to justify my decision to no longer work so much, you know, no longer write as much do business development deals, all that stuff that I promised I would do once the lockdowns began because, hey, you're stuck at home, I'm stuck at home, why not try to make some money?</p><p>As a father of two young children, not working feels like a sin. It really does. It is very hard not to feel responsible for your family. You know, if you're a parent, work is part of what you need to do. You need to make money, you need to stay healthy so you can live a long enough time before your kids become adults, and so forth.</p><p>However, my investment returns have been greater than my active income returns for the majority of years since 2012. Now that's relatively easy to do when you don't have a day job. But of course, I've got financial samurai revenue coming in, and the site has grown over time. But I will say that since 2012, the majority of the years, my investment returns have been greater than my last year of working in finance.</p><p>As a result, I've really begun to question whether it's worth spending any time to make any active income. I've spoken to friends who make from $50,000 to 10 plus million dollars a year, and a lot of them are becoming more and more apathetic to work, partly because their investment returns are grading a greater and greater amount.</p><p>And so they're also thinking to themselves, why bother working so hard? In addition, the active income I do make doesn't do much to stem any losses. For example, let's say I lose 10% on a $5 million portfolio. That's a $500,000 loss. Ouch. Yikes. Even if I worked really, really hard, however, for the next several months to make, let's say $50,000 online, I'd still be down $450,000.</p><p>Losing $450,000, at least on paper, feels the exact same as losing $500,000. It's a terrible feeling. I would say the breakpoint would be maybe around, I think losing $200,000 would feel better than losing $500,000. But anything after $200,000, it just feels bad. It's about the same. Therefore, if I spend any time trying to make money, that precious time to make the extra $50,000 online, I think it would make the situation worse because I would still feel bad about losing $450,000, and yet I would also have spent precious time trying to make that $50,000, which I could have used to do something more enjoyable with my life or spend time with my family.</p><p>And then on the flip side, let's say I return 20% on a $5 million portfolio in one year. It's feasible because in 2020, that's almost what happened. And in 2021, the markets are up about 20% and it's only September 1st about. So that's a $1 million gain, which is amazing.</p><p>Now even if I take on some consulting projects to make, let's say $100,000 over the next several months, a $1.1 million gain doesn't do anything to change our happiness or our lifestyle one bit. And the reason is we comfortably live on much less each year. I don't know what to do with that extra money if I ever had that.</p><p>Maybe I'd buy a fancy car, maybe a Lamborghini. Probably not. I live in San Francisco and the hills are hilly. Would I go on an awesome luxury cruise? I would if there wasn't any COVID, but I'm not going to get on a cruise with my family during the time of COVID.</p><p>So I'd probably just reinvest it and it would make no difference to the quality of our lives and our happiness. Therefore, there has to be some sort of crossover point where spending any amount of time making active income becomes a waste of time. So the only way you would spend time making active income is if you truly love your work.</p><p>So I truly love writing and now podcasting on Financial Samurai. If I didn't, then you wouldn't see me writing random posts about things that would make me no money. You know, the post on if you want to naturally be nicer, get richer. That's not going to make me any money.</p><p>Posts that are going to make me money are sponsored posts or if I do a review on some new product, which you see a lot of other personal finance blogs do, is because that focuses on making money. My focus is on writing and connecting and discussing important real life topics that we all experience.</p><p>And that's one of the reasons why I want to write my book with Penguin Random House because I'm going to cover some of the big life scenarios that we all will face or most of us will face at some point. And I want to decide between help you decide between this choice or that choice.</p><p>So let's talk about the investment returns crossover point. I believe there are two conditions an investor must achieve before they can drop active income due to investment returns. And I want to point out that we are talking about investment returns, not investment income. Investment income is passive income that I've been trying to build to live off.</p><p>But thinking about investment returns is a different way of thinking about trying to retire with the money you have. So investment returns is about what your portfolio will return every single year to pay for your desired living expenses. So the condition number one is at least three years of outperformance.</p><p>If your investment returns are greater than your active income for at least three years in a row, or four years out of the last five years, I think you have the green light to take things down a notch, retire early, change careers, work at a job that doesn't pay well because you love it.</p><p>Now, three years helps minimize the chances that your investment returns are not a fluke. We just don't want to confuse our brains with a bull market. We're in a bull market. So of course, it's easier to make money in our stocks and bonds and real estate investments and so forth.</p><p>And given bear markets, which are defined as a 20% plus sell off, happen every about four years, I use the benchmark of four years out of five years to account for a couple of potentially bad years. The second condition is investments equal to at least 10 times your annual active income.</p><p>So in order for your investment returns to generate more than your active income for three years or longer, you likely need a sizable investment portfolio that is 10 times or greater than your annual active income. And it's really fun how to analyze this because you just run the numbers and you can realize that 10x really is kind of the key benchmark.</p><p>Let's say you make $100,000 a year, you would likely need at least a $1 million portfolio for a chance to generate $101,000 a year. So that's where your investment returns beat your annual active income. To generate $101,000 in investment returns on a $1 million portfolio would require a 10.1% return.</p><p>And that is bang in line with the historical S&P 500 average of about 10.2% since about 1926. So if your entire portfolio is in the S&P 500 and the S&P 500 returns its historical average, you've made it. However, the caveat is investment returns could be much lower in the future.</p><p>So Vanguard in August 2021 came out with their 10-year return assumptions for stocks and bonds and it's very low. Vanguard is assuming a 4.02% return in stocks and even less in bonds. So if Vanguard's return assumptions come true, you're probably going to need at least 20x your annual income until you no longer have to work.</p><p>And there is this debate between what metric to use as a multiple. A lot of people use expenses. I think that's fine. But I like to use annual income as a multiple for net worth targets because it's harder and it allows you to focus more. When you use your annual expenses as a multiple, it's easy to just cut costs and cheat so you don't have to save and invest so much.</p><p>But if you use the income, you just can't cheat. You just have to go with the flow. And since most people make more money over time, using the income will keep you disciplined as you make more money. So the next obvious question is how long will it take investment returns to surpass active income?</p><p>Now, the length of time will depend on your saving rate and your rate of return. Obviously, the higher your saving rate and higher your rate of return, the greater your chance of succeeding. Given I believe your capital needs to reach about 10x your annual gross income in order for your investment returns to regularly have a chance to surpass your active income, let's use two examples.</p><p>The first example is using a 20% saving rate. If you start with nothing and save 20% of your annual gross income each year, in 18 years, one eight, at a 10% compound annual return, you will have accumulated 10x your annual income. In the 19th year, if you continue to get a 10% return, your investment return will have surpassed your static annual income.</p><p>Now, if your rate of return is only 5%, then you will accumulate 10x your annual income in 25 years. If a 5% rate of return continues, then you're really going to have to work about 36 years to finally see your investment returns surpass your annual income. The second example, if you use a 50% savings rate, which I think is the ideal savings rate everyone should shoot for, eventually, I think you're going to have to try to get there if you want to retire early or retire very, very comfortably.</p><p>With a 50% annual gross income each year and 10% compound annual return, you'll reach 10x in about 11 years, and then on the 12th year, you'll succeed. Now, if the rate of return is only 5%, then you will accumulate 10x your annual income in 14 years, again, with a 50% savings rate.</p><p>And if a 5% rate of return continues, then you will have to save and work for 22 years to finally see your investment returns surpass your annual income. Therefore, in conclusion, with a 20 to 50% saving rate and a 5% to 10% annual return assumption, it will likely take between 11 to 25 years until your investment returns steadily surpass your active income.</p><p>Personally, it took me about 15 years to start regularly earning a greater return from my investments. So, the fun part about Financial Samurai is that I'm writing out this analysis using basic math and assumptions, but I'm also living it. I'm living it, folks, and I'm using my situation to double check whether the numbers are reasonable.</p><p>And I do think it'll take 11 to 25 years for the average person if they save 20 to 50% of their annual gross income. And I do want to differentiate again between investment income and investment returns. In normal times, I think generating enough investment income to cover your desired living expenses may be harder than generating high enough investment returns to cover your living expenses.</p><p>Let's just do the math again. Let's say we're in a raging bull market. You've got a $1 million portfolio and it's returning 25% a year. So that's $250,000 in investment returns. To get $250,000 in investment income at a 2% yield requires a $12.5 million portfolio. And obviously, if you withdraw at 4%, it requires half that amount.</p><p>But still, that's a lot more money than $1 million. So the reality is investment income and investment returns are intricately tied together. And the logical thing many people do who no longer want to work is change their investment composition towards less risky, more stable, higher income producing investments once they've achieved their ideal number of retirement.</p><p>And that's different for everyone. It all depends on your lifestyle desires. And let me conclude by saying there is a dangerous level of capital where if you get that amount, nothing matters. You might completely check out and lose all interest in any type of money making endeavor. And it could be a little dangerous.</p><p>It could be a little dangerous. And that level, I believe, starts at when your net worth is equal to over 20 times your annual income or over 50 times your annual expenses. The apathy starts really creeping in and taking over. And then once your net worth gets to over 40 times your annual income or 100 times your annual expenses, I think that's when you start completely checking out.</p><p>And I found myself thinking a lot just in my head like, "F this BS. Screw this. I'm not going to do this because I just don't care anymore." And so that's dangerous. So if you want to stay motivated, let's say you have children to take care of. Let's say you want to be very productive in society.</p><p>You want to produce something. I'm in the middle of writing a book and I got to stay motivated. You might ironically have to keep inflating your lifestyle. So instead of the base model car, you might want to get the luxury supreme model car. Instead of flying economy class, maybe you'll live it up and fly first class.</p><p>Maybe you're going to go private. Whatever the case may be, you can always spend more if you want to stay more motivated. Or you can just give more money away and help other people. And of course, you can do both. So there's a big interesting phenomenon going on right now.</p><p>And that is the greater the investment returns, the more apathetic workers get, or at least investment workers get. So if the strong returns and risk assets continue, eventually productivity will decline. And in that case, the only people left to do the work will be non-investors and new graduates. So I'd love to hear your thoughts on how to use investment returns, if at all, as a gauge to how much you should work and how long you should work.</p><p>I'm also curious to hear from you whether you are getting demotivated as well. And if you don't agree with my multiples, I'd love to hear what your multiples are and why. All right, that's it for this episode, folks. I hope you enjoyed it. And if you liked it, please leave a positive review and share it with all your friends.</p></div></div></body></html>
