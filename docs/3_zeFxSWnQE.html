retire with pensions, especially, or some other form of income can be in a higher tax bracket or in the same tax bracket when you retire.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=2998" target="_blank">00:49:58.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the idea of doing rough conversions because your taxes will be lower when you are 65, 67, all the way to social security, that may not happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3012"

conversions don't really help you in that direction either.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3023"

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3104" target="_blank">00:51:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">We used to spend a lot of time hiking in the mountains.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3107" target="_blank">00:51:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And we moved from, you know, suburban DC to a community out in the Shenandoah Valley to be closer to the mountains.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3115" target="_blank">00:51:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But an important thing for us was a community.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3120" target="_blank">00:52:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">We wanted to have access to clubs with similar interests, you know, to be honest, we're both introverts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3129" target="_blank">00:52:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And so being able to go to whatever would be exercise classes, a conservation group, book clubs, kayaking, hiking, whatever you name it, you know, to form a connection.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3142" target="_blank">00:52:22.360</a></span> | <span class="t">We thought that was very important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3144" target="_blank">00:52:24.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, yeah, we moved out to a new development and I think it's worked out pretty well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3156" target="_blank">00:52:36.440</a></span> | <span class="t">How did you select your place to move to?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3160" target="_blank">00:52:40.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Partly proximity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3164" target="_blank">00:52:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">We love the area.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3166" target="_blank">00:52:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We kind of vacationed nearby for a long time in the general area and it was kind of like an hour and a half closer to the mountains where we like to hike with our dogs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3177" target="_blank">00:52:57.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And the other factor was, particularly for my wife, was not to be too far from our kids who are still in the DC metro area.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3185" target="_blank">00:53:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So could you suffer from having too much to do at a place like that where there's so many activities?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3195" target="_blank">00:53:15.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I mean, I'm a kind of pessimist, Irish glass is half full kind of thing or half empty, I should say.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3205" target="_blank">00:53:25.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm actually incredibly busy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3208" target="_blank">00:53:28.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I have two interests that are outside of the community.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3212" target="_blank">00:53:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm involved in coaching and also involved in conservation work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3215" target="_blank">00:53:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And those are both kind of maybe were a little bit of a surprise to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3219" target="_blank">00:53:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">When I was younger, I used to play a sport very competitively that I now coach.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3226" target="_blank">00:53:46.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And also I was a chess player and an astronomy nerd.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3231" target="_blank">00:53:51.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And those are two things where I feel like I need to dedicate more time to in a retirement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3236" target="_blank">00:53:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So, yeah, I have I'm not really taking advantage of all the happy hours and the food and drinking options, which may be a good thing for my health.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3246" target="_blank">00:54:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But I'm finding this where we're living is not very isolated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3252" target="_blank">00:54:12.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the fact I can coach the university and be involved in the local naturalist group is very fulfilling and, you know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3263" target="_blank">00:54:23.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Very occupying.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3264" target="_blank">00:54:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And did you find it very inviting, you know, moving there where did you know anybody where you moved?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3271" target="_blank">00:54:31.960</a></span> | <span class="t">No, no, we didn't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3273" target="_blank">00:54:33.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'll be honest, I retired young.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3277" target="_blank">00:54:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I did feel a little bit on the younger side of the community.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3281" target="_blank">00:54:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I probably still do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3283" target="_blank">00:54:43.720</a></span> | <span class="t">But, yeah, it wasn't too far from we're ready to move from our home.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3291" target="_blank">00:54:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And like I say, the location made sense to us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3295" target="_blank">00:54:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">My wife knew some people, but it wasn't like some people over here have multiple, you know, family or friends that they're connected with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3305" target="_blank">00:55:05.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But then, you know, it's typical in a lot of these communities and to be honest, where we lived in Northern Virginia, everyone is a transplant and everyone's looking to make new connections.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3316" target="_blank">00:55:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Do you find many people leave the community?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3321" target="_blank">00:55:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And there has been some turnover, some due to personal situations, I think we have seen some people moving in who are relocating because they were somewhere else and they realize they want to be closer to family and a lot of people from around the country, their kids are working in the D.C. area.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3339" target="_blank">00:55:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have quite a few people from all over the country.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3343" target="_blank">00:55:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I have seen some people move out more for the motivations they want to go back to family.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3349" target="_blank">00:55:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, there was a some kind of balance between the family close to here and the family where they came from.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3356" target="_blank">00:55:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that's been the primary factor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3360" target="_blank">00:56:00.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So what activity is the biggest surprise to you that you would have never predicted, let's say 20 years ago, that you'd enjoy?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3372" target="_blank">00:56:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I haven't really done anything like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3374" target="_blank">00:56:14.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I'd been developing hobbies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3376" target="_blank">00:56:16.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I had a runway where the company I worked for was acquired and I kind of had about three years where I knew I wasn't going to be working forever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3387" target="_blank">00:56:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It could have been as long as five, but I thought three years is probably my runway.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3393" target="_blank">00:56:33.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I got back into and some of it was Covid related, you know, sitting on the deck doing photography, I learned to do photography, taking pictures of birds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3402" target="_blank">00:56:42.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's been a fulfilling thing, doing a wide variety of nature photography, but other things have been, you know, resurrecting stuff I did when I was a teenager, a competitive chess player and coaching the sport that I used to play.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3418" target="_blank">00:56:58.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Those are probably the two big things I found it very enjoyable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3423" target="_blank">00:57:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm part of two, you know, special interest book clubs, and that kind of forces me to read at least two books a month that I probably wouldn't have read otherwise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3430" target="_blank">00:57:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's been broadening of the kind of things you might focus on, you know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3434" target="_blank">00:57:14.520</a></span> | <span class="t">You feel like the community lets you have a healthier lifestyle?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3442" target="_blank">00:57:22.600</a></span> | <span class="t">We moved here because of the hiking and my wife also is very active in the exercise classes and they have very good instructors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3456" target="_blank">00:57:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's been important to her.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3457" target="_blank">00:57:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">But no, I mean, I think if you, you know, you can take advantage of the fitness facility or you can sign up for every happy hour, depending on what your focus is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3469" target="_blank">00:57:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I do worry a little bit for the people who are having their five course tequila meals and things like that, you know, quite how that's going to end up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3476" target="_blank">00:57:56.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's no shortage of

One other thing I should say is our local college, I don't know if they still do it, was offering photography, nature photography classes that people found very, very fulfilling as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3722" target="_blank">01:02:02.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know if they still offer them those before COVID.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3728" target="_blank">01:02:08.600</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, Keith, I actually signed up for two classes at our local, we have a, Purdue University has an extension near me, and it was close enough I could ride my bike to it in the fall, and it was quite enjoyable in some regards. Sometimes the teaching,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3745" target="_blank">01:02:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I really have gotten used to a lot of self learning through my career and using resources like YouTube and others.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3752" target="_blank">01:02:32.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And what I noticed, and there was a bunch of international students in the class, some of the teachers on YouTube are world renowned. You know, if you see a session on YouTube about, let's say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3767" target="_blank">01:02:47.720</a></span> | <span class="t">shortest path first algorithms, which is a very specific topic, and there's 5 million views, you know that this teacher probably has their act together. So, for example, there was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3780" target="_blank">01:03:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">a teacher from India, and I had mentioned it to a couple of the Indian students there, and they love this person. And the quality of the teaching</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3790" target="_blank">01:03:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">on YouTube was, in some respects, 10 times better than the local university professor. So, there's a lot of stuff out there that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3799" target="_blank">01:03:19.400</a></span> | <span class="t">is really good, really good, that's available for free, or you can pay for it too, there's some of those courses. But I found the going to school was interesting because it forces you to do stuff, forces you to do the homework.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3812" target="_blank">01:03:32.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I learned a bunch of stuff that I got my eyes open to on a bunch of things that I didn't never expected, for specifically, and we talked about in a previous meeting,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3822" target="_blank">01:03:42.040</a></span> | <span class="t">some of the AI stuff that came along, kind of under my radar, and it just woke me up to that. So, even though I was taking a class on databases and algorithms,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3834" target="_blank">01:03:54.520</a></span> | <span class="t">what I think is, I learned more about was artificial intelligence issues, which was great for me, it was very surprising. So, I really enjoyed that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3841" target="_blank">01:04:01.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Thanks, Jim.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3843" target="_blank">01:04:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Lady Geek, you have your hand up?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3849" target="_blank">01:04:09.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, about courses. I took every possible course I could when I was in college, self-study. I'm very disciplined on that, so I follow what Mark Twain says, "I never let school interfere with my education."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3863" target="_blank">01:04:23.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So, what I did, now that I'm retired, I wanted to learn about something. I just went online to Coursera,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3872" target="_blank">01:04:32.760</a></span> | <span class="t">found a couple of stuff at University of Massachusetts, programming courses, language courses, went through this, looked at that, machine learning algorithm,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3882" target="_blank">01:04:42.200</a></span> | <span class="t">before the chat TPT, the generative AI stuff came out. I went through the course, and, okay, that's nice. So, what are you going to do with the class? I don't know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3891" target="_blank">01:04:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I went to something else, and it just didn't do anything. I mean, if you want to go in person and learn, go to Meetup.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3899" target="_blank">01:04:59.600</a></span> | <span class="t">If you like photography, just put "photography" in the search box, and a half a dozen photography groups will show up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3907" target="_blank">01:05:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">There's one, like, for hiking and photography. If you want to learn nature, go, I mean, instead of a class, which is structured, and you have homework, which I really hate homework, and I really hate writing a paper, so spreadsheets are fine, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3923" target="_blank">01:05:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">just do what you want, and look in Meetup for activities to do in person. If there are social gatherings, take walks with people, and that's how you learn live. I like to call it live training. So, I just walked through the park. I'm listening to birds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3940" target="_blank">01:05:40.600</a></span> | <span class="t">At least when I was doing that, but now I'm playing pickleball, and the fact that I had one red-tailed hawk was watching me play pickleball a couple of weeks ago, sitting on top of a light post.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3952" target="_blank">01:05:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So, instead of -- because everybody thinks, like, when you're in school, when you're in college, when you're in work, what do you do? You get sent to a class. Forget the class environment, just do it for real, go to Meetup, and work with -- just find an activity you like to do, find a group in person, just join. That's how I found pickleball, because I was -- I joined Meetup and found hiking, and then pickleball found me through Meetup, and it turns out that the pickleball course was within walking distance, I knew, and I was like, okay, I'm going to do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3981" target="_blank">01:06:21.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And it turned out that the pickleball course was within walking distance. I never knew it was there until Meetup pointed it out. So, that's --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=3988" target="_blank">01:06:28.520</a></span> | <span class="t">>> Is there anyone on this call who can speak to retirement as a child-free couple? Is there anything that you tend to do differently than a couple with kids or grandkids?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=4003" target="_blank">01:06:43.560</a></span> | <span class="t">>> I have one comment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=4017" target="_blank">01:06:57.800</a></span> | <span class="t">>> Yeah, go ahead.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=4018" target="_blank">01:06:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">>> Just because I don't have any kids, I can't comment -- I'll say my lifestyle hasn't changed, but I do know of one person, when she retired, she moved out of state to be with her kids.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=4032" target="_blank">01:07:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then what happens if you move to be with your kids -- your grandkids, what happens when they don't want you around? You go to all this effort to move, and then all of a sudden, they're fine for a year, and then all of a sudden, it turns out the place you move to, to be with the grandkids, the parents are moving to another area out of the area for work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=4056" target="_blank">01:07:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, there's a double-edged sword there, and she's not in a good position right now. I know another couple who live -- they maintain two homes, but they understand that they love and take care of their grandkids, but they understand that the grandkids may not like them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=4075" target="_blank">01:07:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They just don't want them around. Situations change, or they'll move out of the area. So, just be careful if you retire to be with the grandkids. That might not be a long-term situation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=4095" target="_blank">01:08:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, we have an acquaintance that went through that. And lately, there's been a thread on the site about go-go years, go-slow years. I forget what the name of the title is. It's from one of those books. And it's about, you know, you have the ability to travel, go on a very adventurous vacation, things like that in your early retirement that you may not be able to do when you're 90.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=4116" target="_blank">01:08:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this person we know gave up her best years, really, to raise her grandkids. And there was no appreciation for it. And they didn't treat her very well at the end. And she was very resentful. It wasn't just go see the grandkids every other week. It was full-time daycare-type stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=4142" target="_blank">01:09:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. Let's see if there's anybody else that would like to speak. Otherwise, I think we can call it on this meeting. We'll be publishing the chat. We'll anonymize the chat. And we are also going to put the audio out there.

target="_blank">01:27:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">>> Yep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=5264" target="_blank">01:27:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">>> And also, remember what Mike Piper said, which is retirement sometimes is something that happens to you, not a decision that you make.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=5274" target="_blank">01:27:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">>> Yeah.</span></div><div

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=5298" target="_blank">01:28:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Put that down as your glide path into retirement and then do it on your terms, not on other people's terms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zeFxSWnQE&t=5307" target="_blank">01:28:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">>> I'm making
