Pydantic is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=35" target="_blank">00:00:35.920</a></span> | <span class="t">used in general Python development everywhere, but also in Gen.ai. So it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=40" target="_blank">00:00:40.120</a></span> | <span class="t">used in all of the SDKs and agent frameworks in Python basically. Pydantic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=46" target="_blank">00:00:46.360</a></span> | <span class="t">became a company beginning of 23 and we have built two things beyond Pydantic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=52" target="_blank">00:00:52.260</a></span> | <span class="t">since then. Pydantic AI, an agent framework for Python built on the same</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=58" target="_blank">00:00:58.100</a></span> | <span class="t">principles as Pydantic, and Pydantic Logfire observability platform, which is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=64" target="_blank">00:01:04.740</a></span> | <span class="t">the commercial part of what we do. I'm also a somewhat inactive co-maintainer of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=72" target="_blank">00:01:12.100</a></span> | <span class="t">MCP Python SDK. So MCP is all you need. It's obviously a play on Jason Lu's talks, Pydantic is all you need. He gave at AI engineer, I think first of all, nearly two years ago, and then the second one, Pydantic is still all you need, maybe this time last year. And it has the same basic idea that people are overcomplicating something that we can use a single tool for. And I guess also,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=99" target="_blank">00:01:39.940</a></span> | <span class="t">similarly, the title is completely unrealistic. Of course, Pydantic is not all you need. And neither is MCP for everything. But it has that we have the I think where where we agree is that there are an awful lot of things that MCP can do and that people are overcomplicating the situation sometimes trying to come up with new ways of doing agent to agent communication.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, I'm talking here specifically about autonomous agents or code that you're writing, I'm not talking about the, um, uh, Claude desktop or cursor, uh, Zed, windsurf, etc. Use case of coding agents. Those were what MCP was originally primarily designed for. Um, I don't know whether or not David Pereira would say that, that what we're doing using MCP from Python is that, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.940</a></span> | <span class="t">he definitely wouldn't say it was the primary, uh, use case for, um, for MCP. So two of the, of the primitives of MCP prompts and resources probably don't come into this use case that much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.940</a></span> | <span class="t">They're very useful or should be very useful in the kind of cursor type use case that don't really apply in what we're talking about here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, but tool calling the third primitive is extremely useful for what we're trying to do here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, tool calling is a lot more complicated than you might at first think.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.940</a></span> | <span class="t">A lot of people say to me about MCP are, but couldn't it just be, uh, open API? Why do we need this, uh, custom protocol for doing it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and there's a number of reasons. The idea of dynamic tools, the tools that come and go during an agent execution, depending on the state of the server logging.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So being able to return data to the user while the tool is still executing sampling, which I'm going to talk about a lot today,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.940</a></span> | <span class="t">perhaps the most confusingly named part of MCP, if not tech in general right now, uh, and stuff like tracing observability.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and I would also add to that actually, uh, uh, uh, MCP's way of being allowed to operate as effectively a sub process over standard in and standard out is extremely useful for lots of use cases.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And open API wouldn't, wouldn't solve those problems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is the kind of prototypical image that you will see from lots of people of what, uh, MCP is all about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.940</a></span> | <span class="t">The idea is we have some agent, we have any number of different tools that we can connect to that agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the point is that like the agent doesn't need to be designed with those particular tools in mind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And those tools can be designed without knowing anything about the agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And we can just compose the two together in the same way that, uh, I can go and use a browser and the web application that the website I'm going to doesn't need to know anything about the browser.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.940</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, I know we live in a kind of monoculture of browsers now, but like at least the ideal originally was we could have many different browsers all connecting over the same protocol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.940</a></span> | <span class="t">MCP is following the same idea, but it can get more complicated than this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.940</a></span> | <span class="t">We can have situations like this where, uh, we have tools within our system, which are themselves agents and are doing agentic things, need access to an LLM.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And they of course can then in turn connect to other tools over MCP or directly connecting to tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.940</a></span> | <span class="t">This, this works nicely. This is elegant, but there's a problem. Every single agent in our system needs access to an LLM.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we need to go and configure that. We need to work out resources for that. And if we are, um, using remote MCP servers, if that remote MCP server needs to, um, use an LLM, well now it's worried about what the cost is going to be of doing that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=322" target="_blank">00:05:22.940</a></span> | <span class="t">What, what if the, uh, remote agent that's operating as a tool could effectively piggyback off the, uh, the model that the original agent has access to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=334" target="_blank">00:05:34.940</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what sampling gives us. So as I say, I think sampling is a somewhat, uh, not making that any bigger, unfortunately.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, is that clear on screen? I may, maybe I'll make it bigger like that. Um, sampling is this idea of all of a way where within MCP, the protocol, the, um, server can effectively make a request back through the client to the LLM.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So in this case, client makes a request, starts in some sort of agentic query, makes a call to the LLM.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.940</a></span> | <span class="t">LLM comes back and says, I want to call that particular tool, which is an MCP server. Uh, client takes care of making that call to the MCP server.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=374" target="_blank">00:06:14.940</a></span> | <span class="t">The MCP server now says, Hey, I actually need to be able to use an LLM to answer whatever this question is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So that then gets sent back to the client. The client proxies that request to the LLM, receives the response from the LLM, sends that, uh, onto the MCP server.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And the MCP server then returns and we can continue on our way. Um, sampling is very powerful, not that widely supported at the moment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, I'm going to demo it today with Pydantic AI where we have support for sampling. Well, I'll be honest, it's a PR right now, but it will be soon. It will be merged.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, we have support for sampling both as a, uh, as the client. So knowing how to proxy the, those LLM calls and as a server, basically being able to register, use the MCP client as, as the LLM.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So this example is obviously like all examples trivialized or simplified to be, to fit on screen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=432" target="_blank">00:07:12.940</a></span> | <span class="t">The idea is that we, we're building a like research agent, which is going to go and research open source, uh, packages or libraries for us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=439" target="_blank">00:07:19.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And we have implemented one of the many tools that you would in fact need for this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=444" target="_blank">00:07:24.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And that tool is, um, making, uh, I will switch now to code and show you, uh, the one tool that we have, uh, I'm in completely the wrong file.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=458" target="_blank">00:07:38.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Here we are. Um, so this tool is querying Big Query, the Big Query public dataset for, uh, PyPI to get, uh, numbers about the number of downloads of a particular package.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=472" target="_blank">00:07:52.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is, this is pretty standard Pydantic AI, uh, Pydantic AI code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=477" target="_blank">00:07:57.940</a></span> | <span class="t">We can pick a log file, which I'll show you in a moment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=479" target="_blank">00:07:59.940</a></span> | <span class="t">We have the dependencies that the, uh, that the agent has access to while it's running.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=485"

target="_blank">00:08:07.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So if the agent returns, if the LLM returns the wrong data, we can send a retry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=491" target="_blank">00:08:11.940</a></span> | <span class="t">A big system prompt where we give it basically the schema of the table, uh, tell it what to do, give it a few examples, yadda yadda.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=499" target="_blank">00:08:19.940</a></span> | <span class="t">But then we get to this is the probably the powerful bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=502" target="_blank">00:08:22.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So as an output validator, we are going to go and, first of all, we're going to strip out, uh, markdown block quotes from the SQL.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=510" target="_blank">00:08:30.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, if they're there, then we will, uh, check that the table name is right, that it's querying against and tell it that it shouldn't, if it shouldn't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=518" target="_blank">00:08:38.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we're going to go and run the query.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=521" target="_blank">00:08:41.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And critically, if the query fails, we're going to, uh, raise model retry within Pydantic AI to go and retry, uh, making the, um, uh, making the request to the, um, LLM again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=537" target="_blank">00:08:57.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Saying, asking the LLM to, uh, attempt to, to retry this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=541" target="_blank">00:09:01.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And what we're, the other thing we're doing throughout this, you'll see here, is we have this context dot depth dot mcp context dot log.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=547" target="_blank">00:09:07.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So you'll see here when we define the depth type, we said that that was going to be an instance of this MCP, uh, context, which is what we get when you call the MCP server.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=557" target="_blank">00:09:17.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So what we're doing here is we're having a, we're providing a type safe way within, in this case, um, the agent validator, but it could be in a tool call if you wanted it to be, to access that context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=570" target="_blank">00:09:30.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we can see here that we know, uh, um, in the type hint, uh, uh, uh, the, the, the type is, uh, MCP context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=579" target="_blank">00:09:39.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we have this log function and we know it's signature and we can go and make this log call.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=583" target="_blank">00:09:43.940</a></span> | <span class="t">The point is this is going to return to the client and ultimately to the user watching before the, the thing is completed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=591" target="_blank">00:09:51.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can get kind of progress updates as we go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=593" target="_blank">00:09:53.940</a></span> | <span class="t">MCP also has a context, a concept of progress, which I'm not using here, but you can imagine that also being valuable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=599" target="_blank">00:09:59.940</a></span> | <span class="t">If you knew how far through the query you were, you could show an update in progress.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=603" target="_blank">00:10:03.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So the idea that I think the original principle of, uh, logging like this is that you have the, the cursor style agent running.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=610" target="_blank">00:10:10.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And we want to be able to give updates to the user.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=613" target="_blank">00:10:13.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Don't worry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=614" target="_blank">00:10:14.940</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm still going before it's finished and exactly what's happening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=617" target="_blank">00:10:17.940</a></span> | <span class="t">But you could also imagine this being useful if you were using MCP.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=620" target="_blank">00:10:20.940</a></span> | <span class="t">If this was research agent was, uh, running as a web application, you wanted to show the user what was going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=626" target="_blank">00:10:26.940</a></span> | <span class="t">This deep research might take, you know, minutes to run.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=629" target="_blank">00:10:29.940</a></span> | <span class="t">We can give these logs while the tool call is still executing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=632" target="_blank">00:10:32.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we're just going to take the, the output, turn it into a list of dicts and then format it as XML.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=639" target="_blank">00:10:39.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So you get a nice, uh, models are very good at basically reviewing XML data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=645" target="_blank">00:10:45.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So we basically return whatever the query results are as that kind of XMLish data, which the LLM will then be good at, uh, interpreting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=652" target="_blank">00:10:52.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Now we get to the MCP bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=655" target="_blank">00:10:55.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So in this code, we are setting up an MCP server using fast MCP.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=660" target="_blank">00:11:00.940</a></span> | <span class="t">There are two versions of fast MCP right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=662" target="_blank">00:11:02.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Confusingly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=663" target="_blank">00:11:03.940</a></span> | <span class="t">This is the one from inside the MCP SDK.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=667" target="_blank">00:11:07.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, we, the doc string for our function.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=671" target="_blank">00:11:11.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're registering one tool here, PI PI downloads.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=674" target="_blank">00:11:14.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And our doc string from that function will end up becoming the description on the tool that is ultimately fed to the LLM that chooses to go and call it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=682" target="_blank">00:11:22.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and we're going to pass in the user's question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=686" target="_blank">00:11:26.940</a></span> | <span class="t">I think one of the, one of the important things to say here is of course you could set this up to generate the SQL within your, uh, central agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=697" target="_blank">00:11:37.940</a></span> | <span class="t">You could include all of the, um, uh, description of the SQL, the instructions within your, within the description of the tool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=707" target="_blank">00:11:47.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, models don't seem to like that much data inside a tool description, but more to the point, we're just going to blow up the context window of our main agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=714" target="_blank">00:11:54.940</a></span> | <span class="t">If we're going to ship all of this context on how to make these queries into our main agent, that's just all overhead in all of our calls to that agent, regardless of whether we're going to call this particular tool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=724" target="_blank">00:12:04.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So doing this kind of thing where we're doing the inference inside a tool is a powerful way of effectively limiting, uh, the context window of the, of the main running agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=733" target="_blank">00:12:13.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we're just going to return this output, which will be a string, the value returned from, from here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=739" target="_blank">00:12:19.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And we'll just run the, run the MCP server and by default the MCP server will run over standard IO.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=745" target="_blank">00:12:25.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and then we come to our main application.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=748" target="_blank">00:12:28.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So here we have a definition of our agent and you see we've defined one MCP server.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=754" target="_blank">00:12:34.940</a></span> | <span class="t">That's just going to run the, the script I just showed you, the PI PI MCP server.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=760" target="_blank">00:12:40.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and so then this agent will act as the client and has that registered as the tool to be able to call.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=766" target="_blank">00:12:46.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, we're also going to set the, give it the current date.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=769" target="_blank">00:12:49.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, so it doesn't, uh, assume it's 20, 2023 as they often do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=774" target="_blank">00:12:54.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and now we can go and ultimately run our main agent, ask it, for example, how many downloads Pydantic has had this year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=783" target="_blank">00:13:03.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm going to be brave and run it and see what happens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=786" target="_blank">00:13:06.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, and it has succeeded.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=787" target="_blank">00:13:07.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And it has, uh, gone and told us, uh, that we had whatever 1.6 billion downloads this year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=793" target="_blank">00:13:13.940</a></span> | <span class="t">But probably more interesting is to come and look at what that looks like in Logfire.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=796" target="_blank">00:13:16.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you look at, is it going to come through to Logfire or are we having a failure here as well?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=801" target="_blank">00:13:21.940</a></span> | <span class="t">This, I will admit, this is the run from just before, uh, I came on stage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=805" target="_blank">00:13:25.940</a></span> | <span class="t">But it would look exactly the same.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=806" target="_blank">00:13:26.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm not going to talk too much about observability and how we do, uh, how MCP observability or tracing works within MCP.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=816" target="_blank">00:13:36.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Because I know there's a talk coming up directly after me talking about that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=818" target="_blank">00:13:38.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So think of this as a kind of, uh, spoiler for what's going to come up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=822" target="_blank">00:13:42.940</a></span> | <span class="t">But you can see, we, we run our outer agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=825" target="_blank">00:13:45.940</a></span> | <span class="t">It decides to, it calls, uh, uh, QPT 4.0, uh, which decides, sure enough, I'm going to go and call this tool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=834" target="_blank">00:13:54.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, it doesn't need to think about regeneration with SQL.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=836" target="_blank">00:13:56.940</a></span> | <span class="t">It can just have a natural language description of the query that we're trying to make.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=840" target="_blank">00:14:00.940</a></span> | <span class="t">We then, uh, this is the MCP client.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=843" target="_blank">00:14:03.940</a></span> | <span class="t">As you can see here, MCP client then calls into the MCP server.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=847" target="_blank">00:14:07.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, makes the, which then again runs a different, uh, Pydantic AI, uh, agent, which then makes a call to an LLM, which happens through proxying it through the client.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=859" target="_blank">00:14:19.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's where you can see the service going client server, uh, client server.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=865" target="_blank">00:14:25.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Ultimately, if you look at the top level, uh, exchange with the model, you'll see here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=870" target="_blank">00:14:30.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, the, the, the, the ultimate output was it, which had the, the return response from running the query was, was this kind of XML data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=879" target="_blank">00:14:39.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the LLM was able to turn that into a human description of what was going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=884" target="_blank">00:14:44.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I think the other interesting thing probably is we can go and look in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=887" target="_blank">00:14:47.940</a></span> | <span class="t">We should be able to see the actual SQL that was called.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=890" target="_blank">00:14:50.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is the agent call inside, uh, MCP server.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=894" target="_blank">00:14:54.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can see here the SQL it wrote.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=896" target="_blank">00:14:56.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can confirm that it indeed looks correct.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=899" target="_blank">00:14:59.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, I am going to, uh, go on from there and say, um, thank you very much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=907" target="_blank">00:15:07.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, we are at the booth, the, the pedantic booth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=910" target="_blank">00:15:10.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So if anyone has any questions on this, wants to see this fail in numerous other exciting ways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=914" target="_blank">00:15:14.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Very happy to, to talk to you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=915" target="_blank">00:15:15.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWZk9vTze0&t=916" target="_blank">00:15:16.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Come and say hi.</span></div><div class="c"><span
