So Devon is an AI software engineer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=42" target="_blank">00:00:42.140</a></span> | <span class="t">But we are really focused specifically on working within existing codebases.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=48" target="_blank">00:00:48.140</a></span> | <span class="t">There's lots of amazing AI tools out there for coding, and what we found is that as the codebases get larger, the problem gets harder.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=55" target="_blank">00:00:55.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And most of our customers and

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=64" target="_blank">00:01:04.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And so today I want to talk a little bit more about what Devon is, but more importantly, how we built it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=69" target="_blank">00:01:09.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm going to share some new sort of technical information we're releasing on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=73" target="_blank">00:01:13.140</a></span> | <span class="t">exactly how this works, and I'm really excited to the present to you all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=77" target="_blank">00:01:17.140</a></span> | <span class="t">First, what are we seeing in AI for coding?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=81" target="_blank">00:01:21.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Obviously, this is a really fascinating field.</span></div><div

first large-scale successful applications of Devon AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.140</a></span> | <span class="t">It started in many ways with co-pilots, real-time text completion inside your editor that makes you as an engineer go a bit faster.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=101" target="_blank">00:01:41.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And now we also have AI ITEs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=104" target="_blank">00:01:44.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, a development environment for you as an individual engineer to get even more letters</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=109" target="_blank">00:01:49.140</a></span> | <span class="t">for sometimes delegating entire tasks or snippets and really coding in flow with AI systems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.140</a></span> | <span class="t">We see Devon as part of the third wave of AI technology tools, which is on the fully autonomous agent end of the spectrum.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=124" target="_blank">00:02:04.140</a></span> | <span class="t">more AI teaming than AI programming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=129" target="_blank">00:02:09.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Companies around the world are using Devon like another member of their engineering team,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.140</a></span> | <span class="t">going directly from Tingle to pull requests, collaborating with Devon in Slack or Jira or Linear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And we see the large majority of Devon samples and Devon PRs are starting from within these other tools,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.140</a></span> | <span class="t">the same way we might interact with another human request engineer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So architecturally, this is really different from something that runs locally on your computer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Devon is a cloud AI agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And what we've seen is that it's very daunting to these local AI policy tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.140</a></span> | <span class="t">When you are coding yourself and you want to stay in flow and get that stable,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.140</a></span> | <span class="t">you use a local AI policy tool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Where people use Devon is when they're ready to delegate their tasks entirely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is a very different set of capital trade-offs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.140</a></span> | <span class="t">You get large-scale parallelism, asynchristness, and the ability to completely delegate individuals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.140</a></span> | <span class="t">In the team setting, this also means that Devon is not remotely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And so they share the same environment across different tasks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can try many different things in parallel, combined with Devon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And the teams of engineers who use Devon will break up large-scale engineering outcomes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.140</a></span> | <span class="t">to small individual tasks, delegated into a fleet of Devon,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.140</a></span> | <span class="t">and then coalesced together inside of Devon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And maintain how you look for it for that focus that we created.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.140</a></span> | <span class="t">It also changes the learning model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.140</a></span> | <span class="t">In the cloud AI agent setting, Devon is not just for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.140</a></span> | <span class="t">It's for your team and for your organization.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And so as Devon learns from your interactions, those learnings are not only with you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.140</a></span> | <span class="t">But instead, they're incorporated as part of the team and as part of the organization.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And this reliance on organizational knowledge is something that we've seen</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.140</a></span> | <span class="t">is really important for working with existing large-scale offices.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.140</a></span> | <span class="t">because working with large-scale offices is really hard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I'm going to go into some more detail on exactly how we do this unlimited.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Part one is all about context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.140</a></span> | <span class="t">If you want to build an AI software engineer, you need to understand the existing code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.140</a></span> | <span class="t">You don't want your AI code contributions to be a new framework, adding new dependencies,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.140</a></span> | <span class="t">or being done in isolation of what you already have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And code-based understanding is pretty hard.</span></div><div

often a lot lower than the advertised context window.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.140</a></span> | <span class="t">We have a series of internal benchmarks that measure effective easing capacity across the context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And we find very consistently that the advertised context window is much higher than the effective easing context window.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.140</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:05:07.140</a></span> | <span class="t">You can expand multiple services, multiple repositories, and they can be intertwined in very complicated ways, even for humans.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.140</a></span> | <span class="t">There are huge variations in

of the code base you want them to emulate, and some parts you really want them to stay away from,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.140</a></span> | <span class="t">when it's learning how to be harassing a member of other teams.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Same thing is true for documentation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.140</a></span> | <span class="t">The code might have comments, might have missing comments, might have documentation

target="_blank">00:05:36.140</a></span> | <span class="t">The last critical piece of the code base is that the larger the code base, the more custom it tends to be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Teams and companies build their own proprietary

tool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=396" target="_blank">00:06:36.140</a></span> | <span class="t">The Devon used to get time-level context about the code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=399" target="_blank">00:06:39.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And what we realized is that human engineers wanted to see this information, too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we decided to release it as a standalone project service.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=407" target="_blank">00:06:47.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can take any GitHub URL today and just change the GitHub to deepwiki.com.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=413" target="_blank">00:06:53.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And for any open source

target="_blank">00:07:01.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I looked at the LinkChain in Fabrico.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=424" target="_blank">00:07:04.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And we have a full updated, up-to-date documentation page for LinkChain that has not only the pros of how it's organized, the key concepts in LinkChain's code base, but also architectural diagrams, data flows.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=437" target="_blank">00:07:17.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And we've gotten a lot of feedback from the community that these diagrams are, in some cases or in many cases, actually better than the diagram of the official documentation of very popular open source projects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=449" target="_blank">00:07:29.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=450" target="_blank">00:07:30.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Whether it's folks who are on the TypeScript steering committee, the DLM maintainers, or others.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=455" target="_blank">00:07:35.140</a></span> | <span class="t">We're getting lots of ways to repeat that on how great DLM is before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=459" target="_blank">00:07:39.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And we've had, you know, thousands of code bases start from DLM to DLM as part of their official documentation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=464" target="_blank">00:07:44.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So definitely check this out if you're working on open source code yourself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=470" target="_blank">00:07:50.140</a></span> | <span class="t">How does this work under the hood?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=472" target="_blank">00:07:52.140</a></span> | <span class="t">We just said that LMs are really bad at raising about large code bases.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=476" target="_blank">00:07:56.140</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll give you the algorithm of what we're doing under the hood to generate these pieces.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=481" target="_blank">00:08:01.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Step one, it's actually not about the code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=484" target="_blank">00:08:04.140</a></span> | <span class="t">It's about the concepts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=486" target="_blank">00:08:06.140</a></span> | <span class="t">What are the key principles inside this code base that are going to form our table of context for how we lay out the matter of context of this code base?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=496" target="_blank">00:08:16.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And what we've found is that in many cases those concepts, you don't just get them from the source code itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=503" target="_blank">00:08:23.140</a></span> | <span class="t">There's extremely rich information in the library around the source code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=507" target="_blank">00:08:27.140</a></span> | <span class="t">For example, was that source code added in as part of the full request?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=511" target="_blank">00:08:31.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, which member of the team added that full request?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=513" target="_blank">00:08:33.140</a></span> | <span class="t">What else did they contribute into?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=515" target="_blank">00:08:35.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Was there a discussion in that full request about the code?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=518" target="_blank">00:08:38.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Are there comments?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=519" target="_blank">00:08:39.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Is there documentation?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=520" target="_blank">00:08:40.140</a></span> | <span class="t">The gate to make history.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=522" target="_blank">00:08:42.140</a></span> | <span class="t">All of this metadata is a really useful source for building these high context pieces.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=529" target="_blank">00:08:49.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Once you have those concepts, then you can connect them to the code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=533" target="_blank">00:08:53.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So what are the connections between the various code files and the proprietary or specific concepts inside this code base?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=541" target="_blank">00:09:01.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And after you have that, you need to connect the code itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=545" target="_blank">00:09:05.140</a></span> | <span class="t">There's different sections of the code base.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=547" target="_blank">00:09:07.140</a></span> | <span class="t">There's some files that are more related, less related.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=551" target="_blank">00:09:11.140</a></span> | <span class="t">There's small cases and flows.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=553" target="_blank">00:09:13.140</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a specific way that these different components of the code base connect to each other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=559" target="_blank">00:09:19.140</a></span> | <span class="t">You can look at things like the symbol graph.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=561" target="_blank">00:09:21.140</a></span> | <span class="t">You can look at the call graph.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=563" target="_blank">00:09:23.140</a></span> | <span class="t">You can look at how these files can be used together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=567" target="_blank">00:09:27.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And once you have those code to code connections, then you can actually generate a loop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=572" target="_blank">00:09:32.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And for each concept, what we do is we use an agent to go research that concept in the context of the specific code base.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=578" target="_blank">00:09:38.140</a></span> | <span class="t">We generally engage about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=580" target="_blank">00:09:40.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And when you put this all together, you get very rich representations of code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=590" target="_blank">00:09:50.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And we use graphs as a critical part of those representations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=593" target="_blank">00:09:53.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this is a graph of the LangStream code base where you can see at a high level that different files are more or less related to each other with a lot of logic before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=603" target="_blank">00:10:03.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And then maybe outskirts that are motivated to test artists, documentation, specific integrations with third parties, etc.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=611" target="_blank">00:10:11.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And these data structures power a lot of how they actually work inside a large, you know, million, multi-million, like code base.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=618" target="_blank">00:10:18.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So we've got our region.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=622" target="_blank">00:10:22.140</a></span> | <span class="t">But we also need to be able to search for them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=624" target="_blank">00:10:24.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is another feature that's now mainline in Devon but started as an integral tool for Devon, the AI software engineers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=632" target="_blank">00:10:32.140</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the trend we're seeing, is to make Devon a great software engineer to these building tools that are so useful that human engineers want to use them too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=641" target="_blank">00:10:41.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we have Devon Search, which is essentially deep research on your proprietary code base.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=646" target="_blank">00:10:46.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, whether it's open source or internal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=649" target="_blank">00:10:49.140</a></span> | <span class="t">You can ask questions about the code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=651" target="_blank">00:10:51.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Devon will scan through that code, try to understand what's going on, using both the micro code in individual files, but also the background context it has from this VGA structure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=661" target="_blank">00:11:01.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we'll find this information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=662" target="_blank">00:11:02.140</a></span> | <span class="t">For example, I ask, how do I enforce structured output in microchains?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=665" target="_blank">00:11:05.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And Devon will have found the right section of the documentation for microchains as well as the actual implementation code for what to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=673" target="_blank">00:11:13.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Devon Search gives Devon context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=677" target="_blank">00:11:17.140</a></span> | <span class="t">It's an essential part under the hood of how Devon, the autonomous AI agent, can actually make useful changes inside the larger team-like code bases.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=686" target="_blank">00:11:26.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Once you get a query, you need to do re-processing, and of course, RAG is a component of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=691" target="_blank">00:11:31.140</a></span> | <span class="t">But we end up doing a lot more under the hood than just RAG, including junk removal, some RGS, filtering of less relevant information, and re-ranking multi-hop search,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=701" target="_blank">00:11:41.140</a></span> | <span class="t">to end up with this set of context that we think is very, very knowledgeable in the script.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=706" target="_blank">00:11:46.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And that context, again, includes good source files, but also wiki pages.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=710" target="_blank">00:11:50.140</a></span> | <span class="t">You need the micro and macro context to provide really useful, really useful recommendations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=715" target="_blank">00:11:55.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And from that, you can get the grounding answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=718" target="_blank">00:11:58.140</a></span> | <span class="t">People don't want hallucinations in their vikings, and they don't want hallucinations in their search.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=722" target="_blank">00:12:02.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So the grounding is essential for this to actually be useful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=725" target="_blank">00:12:05.140</a></span> | <span class="t">The second part of how we optimize and customize to existing code bases is a bit more research-oriented.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=734" target="_blank">00:12:14.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm excited to share a little bit more of some of the post-training RL that we do under the hood to make Devon work well inside specific narrow domains.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=744"

It's quite hard to write for optimal CUDA kernels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=857" target="_blank">00:14:17.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And, for example, uh, what we see in practice in the ML community is that a lot of progress in machine learning is really driven by performance on the hardware.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=867" target="_blank">00:14:27.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, even if your algorithm for your new paper is big O, optimal, like a linear tension mechanism, uh, under the hood, if your implementation is not efficient,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=876" target="_blank">00:14:36.140</a></span> | <span class="t">cache-friendly, uh, perform it on actual GPU hardware, it tends to not be at least. So, this is a really active research domain for our ML researchers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=884" target="_blank">00:14:44.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And we want, uh, Kevin to be good at regulating these optimized CUDO kernels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=890" target="_blank">00:14:50.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So, how does this work? Uh, the first step is to define your reward machine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=894" target="_blank">00:14:54.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of the great things about software, and in particular, the CUDO kernels, is that it's often easy to get automatically verifiable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=903" target="_blank">00:15:03.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Can you verify the correctness of your code automatically?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=906" target="_blank">00:15:06.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, in this case, we have a less performance reference implementation that we can use to check the records.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=912" target="_blank">00:15:12.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, whenever Kevin, uh, which is our host-trained, uh, for MLM for this project,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=918" target="_blank">00:15:18.140</a></span> | <span class="t">whenever Kevin writes a kernel, we run through a series of checks, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=922" target="_blank">00:15:22.140</a></span> | <span class="t">First of all, does that code parse? Uh, is it actually valid CUDA? Does it compile? Does it run? Uh, and then after all of that, is it correct?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=929" target="_blank">00:15:29.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And only if it's correct, do we then rate it for performance. How much faster or slower is it than the reference implementation?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=935" target="_blank">00:15:35.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So, with this reward function, notice we don't need a machine learning model here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=939" target="_blank">00:15:39.140</a></span> | <span class="t">This is barely a set of, uh, automatically verifiable steps, uh, which makes, which makes this very, very friendly for high compute RL.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=949" target="_blank">00:15:49.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Once you have a reward function, you can use it for multi-term retainer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=953" target="_blank">00:15:53.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we use multi-term GRBO.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=955" target="_blank">00:15:55.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, and for those who aren't familiar, what's going on here is we're taking multiple different trajectories in sequence for this model to get better at writing CUDA code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=965" target="_blank">00:16:05.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So, on the left here, we have an initial prompt, which results in a chain of thought from the model and output.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=972" target="_blank">00:16:12.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Now output may or may not be correct. Uh, when we move to the second, the middle of this diagram, we provide eval info back to the model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=980" target="_blank">00:16:20.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And this eval info is the results from trying to run that kernel in a real-world GPU environment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=985" target="_blank">00:16:25.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, there's a lot of work you have to do in terms of sandboxing and isolation to make sure these incorrect CUDA kernels don't mess up your training process</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=992" target="_blank">00:16:32.140</a></span> | <span class="t">or crash, which you use, and then you're getting accurate performance benchmarks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=995" target="_blank">00:16:35.140</a></span> | <span class="t">But we package all that up into almost like a struct of eval information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=999" target="_blank">00:16:39.140</a></span> | <span class="t">With that model, you can see as it tries again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1002" target="_blank">00:16:42.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And it tries again with the second chain of thought and the second kernel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1005" target="_blank">00:16:45.140</a></span> | <span class="t">That gets passed to another step.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1007" target="_blank">00:16:47.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And this process works over several steps.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1010" target="_blank">00:16:50.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And the result is hopefully correct and confirmed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1014" target="_blank">00:16:54.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Then you have to distribute the rewards to train this information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1017" target="_blank">00:16:57.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And what we found is that you don't want to just reward based on the final object and its correctness or non and its performance or lack of performance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1027" target="_blank">00:17:07.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Actually, the path to get there is also non.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1030" target="_blank">00:17:10.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you'll notice in red at the bottom here, we have this sum of different rewards discounted by gamma over time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1038" target="_blank">00:17:18.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And what that's showing is the very first trajectory, the very first step of that trajectory, gets a reward even if it wasn't correct itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1047" target="_blank">00:17:27.140</a></span> | <span class="t">If it led to a correct solution and a performance solution downstream.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1051" target="_blank">00:17:31.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Are you marking up the red tree?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1053" target="_blank">00:17:33.140</a></span> | <span class="t">It's basically a reward in one view.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1055" target="_blank">00:17:35.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And what we found in this project is that being able to do this over multiple iterations for these discounted reports was really important for this to work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1063" target="_blank">00:17:43.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And once you do this, you can find that it's not impossible to very deeply optimize for these narrow problem domains.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1079" target="_blank">00:17:59.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So, in this graph, we have the correctness on the left of how many other kernels were written correctly on this log.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1088" target="_blank">00:18:08.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And Kevin32B is getting 91% correct on this session on the kernel benchmark that we're focused on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1095" target="_blank">00:18:15.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can see that compared to even in 04 mini or 03, this is a significant improvement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1101" target="_blank">00:18:21.140</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a narrow domain where high-QRL lets you outperform existing models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1107" target="_blank">00:18:27.140</a></span> | <span class="t">On the right, you see performance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1109" target="_blank">00:18:29.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we rewarded that proportional to how much speedup Kevin got in this project.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1115" target="_blank">00:18:35.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, as the kernels got faster and faster, it got more and more reward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1119" target="_blank">00:18:39.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And what we found is that even from a performance standpoint, Kevin32B is able to outperform a larger scale.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1126" target="_blank">00:18:46.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And this was a really interesting result to us because it kind of flies in the face of many, many sort of broad discussions that, oh, these foundation models are going to be the best at everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1140" target="_blank">00:19:00.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And we don't use them exclusively for everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1142" target="_blank">00:19:02.140</a></span> | <span class="t">But what we see internally all the time is that for any given narrow domain, if you can set up your environment to do high compute RL in that domain, it's very feasible to outperform an out-of-the-the-box application model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1154" target="_blank">00:19:14.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Especially as the open source base models that you start with have improved.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1159" target="_blank">00:19:19.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So, to actually make this work in practice, it's important that you keep your model doing what you actually want it to do and not cheating along the way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1168" target="_blank">00:19:28.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is called word hacking in RL.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1171" target="_blank">00:19:31.140</a></span> | <span class="t">In many cases, it's actually challenging for events.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1173" target="_blank">00:19:33.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I want to show you a few ways that Kevin misbehaved when he had to sort of steer back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1178" target="_blank">00:19:38.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So, one is Kevin realized that he could write the CUDA and then wrap the whole thing in a triangle set block.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1184" target="_blank">00:19:44.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's all mapped to the existing high portion limitations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1187" target="_blank">00:19:47.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, they would always score 100% correct in that case.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1191" target="_blank">00:19:51.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And it had some chance of being faster than average, but it wasn't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1194" target="_blank">00:19:54.140</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a result to the 1x.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1196" target="_blank">00:19:56.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So, that was a very uncorrupted direction for Kevin to go down during the RL process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1200" target="_blank">00:20:00.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And we had to make sure that we updated the word function to recognize this type of word hacking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1206" target="_blank">00:20:06.140</a></span> | <span class="t">The second is even a bit more subtle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1209" target="_blank">00:20:09.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And, so, the test partners to make sure that Kevin's code was correct had a class, in this case called model view, that inherited from the model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1219" target="_blank">00:20:19.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can see here what Kevin realized is that it could implement the model as a subclass of an end.module, which is attempt to optimize the code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1230" target="_blank">00:20:30.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you can just overwrite that classroom in the namespace.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1233" target="_blank">00:20:33.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And, so, you can see you can find a second model view, that this, in this case, just generates directly from the correct model view.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1239" target="_blank">00:20:39.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So, these models got very great at all about how to sort of get around your attention.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1244" target="_blank">00:20:44.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And, this is a challenge in RL.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1246" target="_blank">00:20:46.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So, making sure you directly define your environment is really critical to success.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1251" target="_blank">00:20:51.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And, for those of you who have used any really popular commercial models, like some really popular models for coding,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1256" target="_blank">00:20:56.140</a></span> | <span class="t">you might have seen that as the models get better, sometimes they're more aggressive at doing things like commenting out your test cases</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1263" target="_blank">00:21:03.140</a></span> | <span class="t">to make sure the laws still pass.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1265" target="_blank">00:21:05.140</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what's going on in the hood.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1267" target="_blank">00:21:07.140</a></span> | <span class="t">This is, this is a smell of reward hacking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1270" target="_blank">00:21:10.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And, so, it's a constant term path between the researchers who are trying to steer these models to do what we actually want,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1277" target="_blank">00:21:17.140</a></span> | <span class="t">and the models are trying to exploit every possible way to get this high quality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1281" target="_blank">00:21:21.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So, what we learned from this, custom post training,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1288" target="_blank">00:21:28.140</a></span> | <span class="t">again, it does not perform frontier problems on specific variable domains.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1293" target="_blank">00:21:33.140</a></span> | <span class="t">For reinforcement learning specifically, especially in code, it's more compute now than data now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1298" target="_blank">00:21:38.140</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, KernelBetch, the subset of KernelBetch that we trained on, only had 180 tasks,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1303" target="_blank">00:21:43.140</a></span> | <span class="t">which is really not that many people think about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1305" target="_blank">00:21:45.140</a></span> | <span class="t">But, by applying IPvRL, all that directories again and again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1309" target="_blank">00:21:49.140</a></span> | <span class="t">there is very, very rich rewards that we can learn from.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1311" target="_blank">00:21:51.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And, that's really good at the same software.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1313" target="_blank">00:21:53.140</a></span> | <span class="t">We have an order that can help these rewards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1315" target="_blank">00:21:55.140</a></span> | <span class="t">We actually have the environment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1316" target="_blank">00:21:56.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And, this, in my opinion, is one of the reasons that software, and coding specifically,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1325" target="_blank">00:22:05.140</a></span> | <span class="t">has accelerated particularly fast as AI capability.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1328" target="_blank">00:22:08.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Is that code is one of the few things where this property holds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1332" target="_blank">00:22:12.140</a></span> | <span class="t">I used to be a machine learning that scale,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1335" target="_blank">00:22:15.140</a></span> | <span class="t">which provides close range of data for many of the .</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1339" target="_blank">00:22:19.140</a></span> | <span class="t">and it gets really hard to label by hand, high-quality, high accuracy data, as it all gets hard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1348" target="_blank">00:22:28.140</a></span> | <span class="t">But, code doesn't have that quality because you can seemingly scale based on automatic signals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1352" target="_blank">00:22:32.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And, that's really the third key.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1354" target="_blank">00:22:34.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Automatic verification allows you to scale.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1357" target="_blank">00:22:37.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So, if you want code bases in your own process, putting in the CI systems, putting in the test coverage, putting in the harnesses that allow the operator infusion,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1366" target="_blank">00:22:46.140</a></span> | <span class="t">is going to future-proof your code as RL, as AI gets better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1369" target="_blank">00:22:49.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And, we see many of them, they first take their code base with Debit and go fix all the test coverage issues.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1376" target="_blank">00:22:56.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And, now, they have full test coverage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1378" target="_blank">00:22:58.140</a></span> | <span class="t">It's even faster if you've got it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1380" target="_blank">00:23:00.140</a></span> | <span class="t">The last big point here is, I just showed you the example on .</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1387" target="_blank">00:23:07.140</a></span> | <span class="t">But, to me, the more interesting, deeper application of this research is, every code base is, in some sense, a narrow domain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1395" target="_blank">00:23:15.140</a></span> | <span class="t">There are specific things to your code that don't exist in anyone else's code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1399" target="_blank">00:23:19.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And, that's more and more true to the larger code bases.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1401" target="_blank">00:23:21.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you can imagine a future where high-to-cube RL, and preferred code-based customization, leads to significantly outperforming agents on each individual domain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1411" target="_blank">00:23:31.140</a></span> | <span class="t">The equivalent of hiring a software engineer and giving them millions of years of experience working specifically in your environment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1418" target="_blank">00:23:38.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So, this is some of the research work we've been doing in this conversation that powers Debit around the hood.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1422" target="_blank">00:23:42.140</a></span> | <span class="t">If you'd like to play around and try this yourself, you can use, you can go to Debit.ai and sign up your account.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1428" target="_blank">00:23:48.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Connect it with your distinct code, give it a task, and go from taking it to PR.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvouMXe51sk&t=1432" target="_blank">00:23:52.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you so
