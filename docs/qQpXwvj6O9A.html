target="_blank">00:26:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Jonathan Goldberg is a secular therapist who defines CBT or cognitive behavioral therapy in this way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQpXwvj6O9A&t=1610" target="_blank">00:26:50.600</a></span> | <span class="t">He writes, "With CBT, a clinician works with an individual to understand how automatic negative thoughts can contribute to emotional feelings,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQpXwvj6O9A&t=1621" target="_blank">00:27:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">as well as physical feelings, and how the individual can engage in positive behaviors that help to manage these feelings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQpXwvj6O9A&t=1630" target="_blank">00:27:10.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Behaviors can be adaptive or maladaptive, meaning behaviors can lead to healthier levels of functioning or can lead to poorer levels of functioning."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQpXwvj6O9A&t=1645" target="_blank">00:27:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, what you see just in that brief statement that cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on three basic things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQpXwvj6O9A&t=1654" target="_blank">00:27:34.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I think this would be just a summary.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQpXwvj6O9A&t=1657" target="_blank">00:27:37.240</a></span> | <span class="t">It focuses on thoughts and then the relationship of thoughts to emotions, the relationship of thoughts to behaviors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQpXwvj6O9A&t=1668" target="_blank">00:27:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So the entire presupposition of cognitive behavioral therapy is that the reason you behave the way you do is because you have thoughts about your life and about what is happening to you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQpXwvj6O9A&t=1686" target="_blank">00:28:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, this particular secular approach is going to be a little more nuanced.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQpXwvj6O9A&t=1693" target="_blank">00:28:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">You have to be a little more

would say that there are some similarities between cognitive behavioral therapy and biblical counseling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQpXwvj6O9A&t=1706" target="_blank">00:28:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to be quick to add that there are also massive

that you will see that perhaps cognitive behavioral therapy echoes some of the truths that we've been learning in our biblical counseling class.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQpXwvj6O9A&t=1723" target="_blank">00:28:43.800</a></span> | <span class="t">We teach in biblical counseling that the source of your behavior are the thoughts and the intentions of your heart, that it's out of your heart, the flow, the issues of life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQpXwvj6O9A&t=1734" target="_blank">00:28:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of the characteristics of the heart is that the heart is always thinking, the heart is always evaluating, the heart is always having a certain perspective, interpretation on the events of life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQpXwvj6O9A&t=1746" target="_blank">00:29:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It is what is going on in your heart affects your emotions and ultimately expresses itself in outward behavior.</span></div><div

And God is the most important subject in the Bible. God is the most important subject in biblical counseling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQpXwvj6O9A&t=2169" target="_blank">00:36:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you do all this work with thoughts, emotions, and behavior, but you leave out how those thoughts, emotions, and behavior are relating to the true and the living God,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQpXwvj6O9A&t=2178" target="_blank">00:36:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">you have fallen short of helping a person move toward biblical sanctification.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQpXwvj6O9A&t=2186" target="_blank">00:36:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So, a biblical evaluation here, there are some similarities to the concepts of biblical sanctification, the relationship between thoughts and behaviors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQpXwvj6O9A&t=2199" target="_blank">00:36:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">There is some similarity to the put-off-put-on concept in sanctification. One major shortfall of CBT is that it does not seek to replace a person's thinking with scripture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQpXwvj6O9A&t=2212" target="_blank">00:36:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It simply seeks a person, to help a person replace negative thoughts with constructive thoughts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQpXwvj6O9A&t=2220" target="_blank">00:37:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But we are seeking to help people replace ungodly thoughts with true thoughts from scripture.

move to the third secular approach, and this is the biogenic theory of mood disorders.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQpXwvj6O9A&t=2382"

disorders are due to imbalances of chemicals in our brain like dopamine and serotonin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQpXwvj6O9A&t=2402"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQpXwvj6O9A&t=2408" target="_blank">00:40:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Elliot Valenstein is a secular therapist who writes of this perspective, and he actually does some critique of this perspective.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQpXwvj6O9A&t=2419" target="_blank">00:40:19.840</a></span> | <span

cause mental illness, and that drug treatment works because it corrects this underlying imbalance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQpXwvj6O9A&t=2443" target="_blank">00:40:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And as one resource defines, the biogenic amine hypothesis of depression postulates that depression is due to a reduced functional activity of one or more brain amines.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQpXwvj6O9A&t=2459" target="_blank">00:40:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you have this theory that there are imbalances in the brain, imbalances in serotonin or norepinephrine.</span></div><div
