And the first is just to check in before you get to the airport. - 1000%. We always check in 24 hours or sometimes 30 hours, depending on the airline, in advance to make sure that we have boarding passes in hand.</p><p>We understand if our known traveler numbers or our fast track security or our premier access or whatever is showing on the boarding pass. And if it's not, that's the time to troubleshoot it. It's a day in advance. You definitely don't want to be at the airport with very little time to spend and you've got to wait into a line at the counter to talk to somebody to actually get a boarding pass.</p><p>You're not doing it right. So check in 24 hours in advance. For some airlines like Southwest, that's almost a requirement, right? If you don't check in and get a better boarding pass, you will be waiting in line in the back of the B's or the C's in a bad boarding position, which is never what you want.</p></div></div></body></html>
