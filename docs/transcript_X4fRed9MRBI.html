But within the health and fitness world, I think there are a handful of diagnostics that might make sense to give someone. So, for example, high cholesterol runs in our family. So I gave a lot of people in our family a LP little a blood test.</p><p>And I just ordered it up at LabCorp Quest, whichever was closer to a lot of people, so they knew that kind of reminds me of how lots of people were giving out 23andMe kits back in the day. But some of the interesting things to consider as gifts are getting someone a DEXA scan.</p><p>I did mine at DEXA Fit, and they have locations all around the country. And that was a really cool experience. So that would be a cool one. Not that expensive. Just a blood panel, right? InstaLab has a longevity panel that's about $300. There's Function Health. There's Inside Tracker. I'll include links to all of these, but that's something super interesting.</p><p>I know that depending on your insurance, some of these tests might be covered, but some of them might not be.</p></div></div></body></html>
