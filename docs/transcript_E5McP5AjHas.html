Just to be clear, I don't think I've ever spent the $5,000 to $20,000 those business class flights take, right?</p><p>This is not me speaking out of a desire to spend on that level of luxury. It's just that if you figure out how to use these tools, if you figure out how to time the card bonuses and your spend, you end up getting to a point that you're somewhat spoiled to the fact that you can find a way to do it in a premium cabin at a very reasonable price almost every time.</p><p>Exactly. The points and miles, it's amazing. It lets you do things like this routinely that you would have never even considered forking out the cash to do.</p></div></div></body></html>
