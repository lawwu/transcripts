What I expect, many of you are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=61" target="_blank">00:01:01.300</a></span> | <span class="t">expecting, is for me to start talking about what AI engineering is. And so to kind of try</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=69" target="_blank">00:01:09.300</a></span> | <span class="t">try to help with this, I made a little simple chatbot. I call it AI leader GPT. And I figured,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=75" target="_blank">00:01:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">let's have it answer your questions. I'm pretty lazy. I have a lot of stuff on my plate. I figured,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">just hand it over to AI. That's kind of our goal anyway. So I asked my little chatbot that I want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=85" target="_blank">00:01:25.980</a></span> | <span class="t">ask some questions. I asked it, what does AI engineer mean? Unfortunately, this is one of those moments where,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.840</a></span> | <span class="t">clearly, the intelligence isn't there yet. Despite a lot of improvement on MMLU, we yet can't define</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=100" target="_blank">00:01:40.020</a></span> | <span class="t">this term. So unfortunately, I'll have to do this myself. Okay, so let's start with the question,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.440</a></span> | <span class="t">what? Building an AI product requires a team. But what does this role really look like? I'm going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=114" target="_blank">00:01:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">tell you what my very first job posting looked like. And I'm going to talk you through it to try to give</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.340</a></span> | <span class="t">you some sense of what this actually should be. I was looking for a senior engineer. That senior</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=124" target="_blank">00:02:04.500</a></span> | <span class="t">engineer could come from SWE or MLE. And we wanted them to rapidly expand our capabilities for greenfield</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.840</a></span> | <span class="t">applications. That should sound very normal, should sound very expected. Unfortunately, while we respect</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.740</a></span> | <span class="t">ML researchers, we are explicitly not looking for this. This was in the job posting. For those of you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that are putting up job postings, I highly recommend that if this is not what you're looking for, that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=155" target="_blank">00:02:35.820</a></span> | <span class="t">tell them. It is both a waste of your time and their time for them to apply hoping to go to ICLR based on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.020</a></span> | <span class="t">work they're going to work they're going to do at your company. Once again, this is not for lack of a deep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.180</a></span> | <span class="t">interest in their work. This is just not the stage we're at. I would love to hear from you if you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.740</a></span> | <span class="t">experience getting ML or AI capabilities into production and serving real users. If you have a lot of that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">enthusiasm for applications of AI to business problems. And if you have a core understanding of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.660</a></span> | <span class="t">architectural things, maybe you've read one of the books on MLOps. Maybe you've read previous discussions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">about MLOps. Maybe you've worked in some infra adjacent things as a back-end engineer. That all sounds</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">wonderful. And here we start to get a little controversial. You should be comfortable working in both Python</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and TypeScript. It's okay if you are only strong in one, but you should be open to both. Our application</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.440</a></span> | <span class="t">is built in TypeScript. I need people who are going to be willing to get into the details that get into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.660</a></span> | <span class="t">the nitty-gritty there. I don't need you to come in as an expert on React, but I do need you to be able</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.420</a></span> | <span class="t">to interface with those people in a really productive way. So I went back to my little GPT and I said, I'd</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.800</a></span> | <span class="t">really like to understand the when, the why, the who, and the how of all of this process. And so let's go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.580</a></span> | <span class="t">through those things. First up, when? Well, it actually kind of depends. It depends where you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">are in your journey. If you're early in your journey, you need SWE skills, you need data profiles, and you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.200</a></span> | <span class="t">need product competency. If you're middle stage, you need SWE some more, probably some more infra. You need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">data profiles, but you also need some design. This last one is the number one thing that I see teams</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">under-investing in. If you're later stage, you definitely need infra. You need all the above,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.940</a></span> | <span class="t">but a little bit scaled. And now you need to start actually thinking about machine learning engineers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.420</a></span> | <span class="t">This is when you want to start. Yeah? Yeah, totally. So data scientists, data analysts, people that have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.200</a></span> | <span class="t">lot of experience looking at distributions of data and saying, wait a minute, that's strange. Looking at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.340</a></span> | <span class="t">user output and saying, hmm, this is actually quite different than we were expecting. Looking at sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.180</a></span> | <span class="t">like product analytics and saying, you know what? This retention is pretty poor. One thing that I would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.500</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of ask everybody in this room to do for yourself right now is how good should retention be on an AI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=329" target="_blank">00:05:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">product? If you don't know that about your product, both what the comparables are for other products,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.500</a></span> | <span class="t">you're missing an opportunity. You're missing an opportunity to hire people who have been doing this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">for a long time. They will up-level your team. So in the later stages, now you need to start talking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.760</a></span> | <span class="t">about MLEs. Maybe because you need to fine-tune a model. Maybe because you need to fine-tune an embedding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.020</a></span> | <span class="t">you should start early. However, it is extremely dangerous to accidentally fall into the trap of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=367" target="_blank">00:06:07.660</a></span> | <span class="t">mythical man month. This is true in all software's, all product development. It is somehow magnified in AI. I see more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.020</a></span> | <span class="t">people overdoing this in AI than I do in other domains. So if the AI demo only takes one week and the AI product</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=387" target="_blank">00:06:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">clearly takes only four weeks if you throw 20 engineers at it. I don't have 20 engineers, but even if I did, I certainly wouldn't be putting them on the same AI product.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=398" target="_blank">00:06:38.540</a></span> | <span class="t">There is a very, very, very important reminder that nine women cannot give birth in a single month.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=409" target="_blank">00:06:49.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Because all AI products are early by definition, the mythical man month is especially true for early products. You really, really, really need to be careful here. When I speak to my peers, this is the number one mistake that I'm hearing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=427" target="_blank">00:07:07.540</a></span> | <span class="t">The hiring schedule should reflect the development schedule. So you should start with an early product that you get in front of users. Then you should start by building evals. Then you should get user feedback. And then you should iterate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=443" target="_blank">00:07:23.100</a></span> | <span class="t">If you want more details about this, you can either consult this paper that we released, what we learned last year of building LLMs, or you can come to our talk later today to get more information on this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=453" target="_blank">00:07:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">This development schedule, this is not just my opinion. It's not just six of our opinions. This is tried and tested, speaking to a lot of other people. This is what works. This order of operations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=465" target="_blank">00:07:45.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So if this order of operations works, then your hiring had better be well aligned to it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=469" target="_blank">00:07:49.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Data needs to come much earlier than in traditional product engineering efforts. You asked the question about, like, what do data profiles look like?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=479" target="_blank">00:07:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the things that is very, very true about AI, partly because of this development schedule, but also because of the type of products that we're trying to build, you really need to be looking at your data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=491" target="_blank">00:08:11.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And all of us can look at data, but some people are literally professionals at just looking at the data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=497" target="_blank">00:08:17.460</a></span> | <span class="t">That intuition takes a long time to build and will level up your team.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=502" target="_blank">00:08:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So, unfortunately, why is a little bit of a harder question existentially.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=510" target="_blank">00:08:30.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So we'll try to scope it down a teeny bit to just be why hire for these teams.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=515" target="_blank">00:08:35.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Why not just use your existing resources?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=518" target="_blank">00:08:38.120</a></span> | <span class="t">The hiring theses for this initial team is going to look like the following.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=526" target="_blank">00:08:46.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reason I wanted to kind of give you these theses is because ultimately your leadership is probably asking you, what's your hiring thesis?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=533" target="_blank">00:08:53.320</a></span> | <span class="t">What's your hiring thesis?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=534" target="_blank">00:08:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">We have this person on this other team.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

target="_blank">00:18:19.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1100" target="_blank">00:18:20.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Could you maybe at like a high level give an example for data intuition and the product design sort of prompts that you're doing?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1110" target="_blank">00:18:30.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Because I find I think the coding one's a little bit more deterministic and easy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1114" target="_blank">00:18:34.200</a></span> | <span class="t">With those I'm not really sure where to start but it sounds like an excellent way to conduct the interview.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1118" target="_blank">00:18:38.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so this is specifically for getting data intuition signaled during the interview process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1123" target="_blank">00:18:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so for me it is actually part of the interview process like I'm giving them a large set of data and I'm asking them to like form some opinions about some of the data contained there in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1134" target="_blank">00:18:54.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So, roughly a clustering problem but the secret is there's like no actual good clusters, there's no actual like objective way to cluster that data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1144" target="_blank">00:19:04.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So, what I'm hoping that they're going to do is be able to pull out some sort of like latent meaning in that data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1151" target="_blank">00:19:11.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I do this as a take home because one, I think people, I mean we all know that people program substantially worse during an interview process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1160" target="_blank">00:19:20.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And also like how often is your manager staring over your shoulder when you're doing data analysis?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1166" target="_blank">00:19:26.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Not that often.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1167" target="_blank">00:19:27.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So, like I don't see a lot of value in that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1169" target="_blank">00:19:29.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I give them seven days to complete a take home challenge, they get to look at the data, they get to write up a little report, and then I do a live interview with them where I give them feedback on their proposal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1178" target="_blank">00:19:38.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So, this gives me a couple things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1180" target="_blank">00:19:40.100</a></span> | <span class="t">One, I get to see how well did they do and I get to really like talk to them about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1185" target="_blank">00:19:45.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Two, if I misunderstood something about their approach, them talking through that notebook with me is a really good opportunity for me to say, oh, actually I misunderstood what you did.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1196" target="_blank">00:19:56.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Three, I'm going to give them a lot of feedback.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1199" target="_blank">00:19:59.100</a></span> | <span class="t">This has two important effects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1202" target="_blank">00:20:02.100</a></span> | <span class="t">One, they're going to learn what it's like to give feedback from me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1206" target="_blank">00:20:06.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Am I an asshole?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1207" target="_blank">00:20:07.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I guess we'll find out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1209" target="_blank">00:20:09.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And they'll know by the end of the interview if getting feedback from me sucks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1212" target="_blank">00:20:12.100</a></span> | <span class="t">That's really important for them to make a decision about working for me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1216" target="_blank">00:20:16.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And then on the flip side, I get to learn what they're like to interact with when I'm giving feedback.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1220" target="_blank">00:20:20.100</a></span> | <span class="t">If they did a really great job, a lot of my feedback will like, this is really cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1224" target="_blank">00:20:24.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Where could we go next?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1226" target="_blank">00:20:26.100</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the things that your responsibility is as a leader is to always have feedback, period.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1233" target="_blank">00:20:33.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it's your responsibility during the interview process to show them what that experience is going to feel like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1239" target="_blank">00:20:39.100</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a big part of the matching problem for hiring.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1242" target="_blank">00:20:42.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And then finally, this interview is an opportunity for us to talk about sort of like how do they think through what is the minimum deliverable on some given task.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1253" target="_blank">00:20:53.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And we give them four hours over seven days.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1256" target="_blank">00:20:56.100</a></span> | <span class="t">If they turn something in that's clearly 15 hours worth of work, that's a red flag.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1262" target="_blank">00:21:02.100</a></span> | <span class="t">If they turn something in that's like really well scoped for four hours, that's a green flag.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1268" target="_blank">00:21:08.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And frankly, if they turn in something that's like overly simplified, I have the opportunity to say, hey, I think this is maybe like a little bit like under what I was expecting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1278" target="_blank">00:21:18.100</a></span> | <span class="t">What was your logic?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1279" target="_blank">00:21:19.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And sometimes, and frankly, I've hired one of these people, the feedback was, I really didn't see much value in going any deeper until we reviewed this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1289" target="_blank">00:21:29.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Talk about a green flag.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1290" target="_blank">00:21:30.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Talk about a green flag.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1291" target="_blank">00:21:31.100</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a, fuck yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1292" target="_blank">00:21:32.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, get in here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1293" target="_blank">00:21:33.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, so that is why I think the style of interviewing is so important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1298" target="_blank">00:21:38.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And getting that like data intuition out of it is the core goal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1304" target="_blank">00:21:44.100</a></span> | <span class="t">But this format allows me to sort of like tag on a lot of extra signal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1308" target="_blank">00:21:48.100</a></span> | <span class="t">That one's a little bit harder for me to get into, but basically we ask you to like design a physical product and they meet with our design team and it's incredible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1320" target="_blank">00:22:00.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I did it

that like strong engineers, strong software engineers should be constantly thinking about sort of like the adversarial nature of humans interacting with software and be thinking about like where they're bringing up risks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1377" target="_blank">00:22:57.100</a></span> | <span class="t">But I tend to think a lot about security is lying outside the team.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1382" target="_blank">00:23:02.100</a></span>

target="_blank">00:23:05.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'd like to ask, tell me why you think I'm wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1387" target="_blank">00:23:07.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I've heard of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1397" target="_blank">00:23:17.100</a></span> | <span class="t">It's blowing up lately.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1399" target="_blank">00:23:19.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So where we've had the most success is bringing security people to be part of our internal product teams at the beginning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1408" target="_blank">00:23:28.100</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1413" target="_blank">00:23:33.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And we don't have to retrain everybody outside in a separate security team.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1418" target="_blank">00:23:38.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's why I raised my eyebrow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1420" target="_blank">00:23:40.100</a></span> | <span class="t">We've seen that pattern work to grab a smart and engaged security person to be part of that effort rather than trying to hold on for a veteran.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1431" target="_blank">00:23:51.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I love that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1432" target="_blank">00:23:52.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that's really like insightful and really like meaningful in sectors that are a little different than mine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1439" target="_blank">00:23:59.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that makes 100% of sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1442" target="_blank">00:24:02.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And like even in my domain where we have a lot of like sensitive customer data, we sign BAs with every like provider that we work with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1450" target="_blank">00:24:10.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Like I do, I mean bluntly, like I take on a lot of that responsibility personally as the team lead.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1457" target="_blank">00:24:17.100</a></span> | <span class="t">But I can absolutely see value in what you're talking about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1462" target="_blank">00:24:22.100</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:24:28.100</a></span> | <span class="t">You guys have security as a product.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1470" target="_blank">00:24:30.100</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like they can.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1471" target="_blank">00:24:31.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1472" target="_blank">00:24:32.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1473" target="_blank">00:24:33.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1474" target="_blank">00:24:34.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1475" target="_blank">00:24:35.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Hi.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1476" target="_blank">00:24:36.100</a></span> | <span class="t">You're talking about creating new teams and hiring teams.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1479" target="_blank">00:24:39.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And now I see another very important aspect is that upskilling or reskilling existing teams.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1487" target="_blank">00:24:47.100</a></span> | <span class="t">What would be your advice as well because in my, in my, I mean, it's, you're not always like creating new teams.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1495" target="_blank">00:24:55.100</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, always doing with like human depth, you know, like existing teams and software engineer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1500" target="_blank">00:25:00.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, most of them can be reluctant or can be, you know, this kind of routine software engineer being there for years and years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1508" target="_blank">00:25:08.100</a></span> | <span class="t">What would be your two cents about like re-screening, upskilling and making all these mayonnaise work with the new team, you know?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1516" target="_blank">00:25:16.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1517" target="_blank">00:25:17.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I think this is really important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1518" target="_blank">00:25:18.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm going to repeat back to the question, make sure I totally understand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1521" target="_blank">00:25:21.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So your point is I focus a lot on zero to one for teams, but when you want to take an existing product team and you want to like add AI capabilities and make sure that they're set up for success.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1533" target="_blank">00:25:33.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Is that correct?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1534" target="_blank">00:25:34.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Perfect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1535" target="_blank">00:25:35.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1536" target="_blank">00:25:36.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So, um, really, really good point and really important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1538" target="_blank">00:25:38.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, I think, I believe that the AI capabilities at any given company should have at least one team who's responsible for building the infrastructure to make that easy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1550" target="_blank">00:25:50.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't, I know Netflix is like very divergent and thinking from what I'm about to say.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1556" target="_blank">00:25:56.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'll caveat with that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1557" target="_blank">00:25:57.100</a></span> | <span class="t">But what I do want to add is like in most companies, every individual product team should not be going up and setting up the relationship with open AI separately.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1568" target="_blank">00:26:08.100</a></span> | <span class="t">They should not be going and figuring out how to like build a prompt, like, uh, infrastructure in your software.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1575" target="_blank">00:26:15.100</a></span> | <span class="t">They should not be understanding what the evaluation system is going to look like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1579" target="_blank">00:26:19.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I really think all of that should be coalesced for every given company.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1584" target="_blank">00:26:24.100</a></span> | <span class="t">There should be one team responsible for that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1586" target="_blank">00:26:26.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And then what I believe works very well is to have other teams like you're talking about product teams then say, we're going to treat you like a different infra team.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1596" target="_blank">00:26:36.100</a></span> | <span class="t">We're going to ask certain things of you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1598" target="_blank">00:26:38.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we're going to have very similar to the profile that we talked about one person who's really responsible on that product team for interfacing with the platform team.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1608" target="_blank">00:26:48.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I worked at Citrix for a long time where the data scientist had access to a data platform team.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1613" target="_blank">00:26:53.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And the data platform teams charter was do whatever they possibly can so that data scientists can move as fast as possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1621" target="_blank">00:27:01.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I really believe in that model and I've seen it personally as a consumer be incredibly powerful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1627" target="_blank">00:27:07.100</a></span> | <span class="t">We were trying to like build new models, deploy them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1630" target="_blank">00:27:10.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is not so different.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1634" target="_blank">00:27:14.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I really believe that like having a centralized like platform team for AI at your company has so much leverage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1642" target="_blank">00:27:22.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's a little bit of my like opinion here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1645" target="_blank">00:27:25.100</a></span> | <span class="t">The one caveat is again, I know Netflix disagrees with this persona and every individual product team at Netflix has the like open like opportunity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1654" target="_blank">00:27:34.100</a></span> | <span class="t">If they just want to go do it from scratch, go ahead, have fun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1657" target="_blank">00:27:37.100</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's a little bit of like reason why that makes sense for Netflix and not for most of us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1661" target="_blank">00:27:41.100</a></span> | <span class="t">We're at time, but this is going to be our last question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1664" target="_blank">00:27:44.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1665" target="_blank">00:27:45.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Hey, Brian.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1666" target="_blank">00:27:46.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Thanks for the great talk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1667" target="_blank">00:27:47.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Thanks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1668" target="_blank">00:27:48.100</a></span> | <span class="t">What I was hoping to get your opinion on is when you're hiring or maybe not reskilling your team.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1673" target="_blank">00:27:53.100</a></span> | <span class="t">You mentioned a lot of great attributes that you should look at like data literacy, your urgency and your general enthusiasm for I guess generative AI products in general.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1682" target="_blank">00:28:02.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So I was wondering when you're doing hiring, what do you think are some of the attributes that are non-negotiable and what do you think are some attributes that are trainable?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1689" target="_blank">00:28:09.100</a></span> | <span class="t">The sense that if you hire a software engineer who has a lot of enthusiasm and a lot of skills that could benefit but doesn't really have the data literacy, do you think that's okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1698" target="_blank">00:28:18.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Or if you hire a data scientist who might not have the urgency but the background?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1701" target="_blank">00:28:21.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I think all three of the attributes I mentioned, there needs to be some kernel there that I can develop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1707" target="_blank">00:28:27.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Zero on any of them scares me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1710" target="_blank">00:28:30.100</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's one latent feature that I didn't mention that I've never personally successfully trained and is a really big, powerful feature in my model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1719" target="_blank">00:28:39.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's curiosity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1720" target="_blank">00:28:40.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Actually, I think that's a fantastic way to end.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1724" target="_blank">00:28:44.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Give it up for Brian.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXMKT2FDRk&t=1726" target="_blank">00:28:46.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you.</span></div><div
