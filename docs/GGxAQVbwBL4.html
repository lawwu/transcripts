You may have, well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=69" target="_blank">00:01:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">no, I'm gonna just go like you didn't do that. Okay. So this is our repo that we're gonna be working with today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=75" target="_blank">00:01:15.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It has, yes.

Sorry about that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, so you can actually see. Yeah. I'm always in dark mode. Sorry. Can we do, can we do that? I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.320</a></span> | <span class="t">know. Just these lights along here? Yeah. Just the lights in front of the video screen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.400</a></span> | <span class="t">We'll work on that. I love that people are raising their hand. This makes me very excited. I love talking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to people. I love being in the room with folks. So this is good. So I'll tell you a little bit about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.480</a></span> | <span class="t">what our goals are for our next, you know, 120 minutes together. What we're focusing on, obviously,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.320</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of you went to the intro to GraphRag this morning. How many people have been working on RAG</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.520</a></span> | <span class="t">applications already? Yes, yes, yes. Excellent. How many people have been working on GraphRag already?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.960</a></span> | <span class="t">A good number. Okay. So what I'm going to be doing today is talking specifically about how you can use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.280</a></span> | <span class="t">graph data science to improve what you're working on in your applications. The reason that we are doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.840</a></span> | <span class="t">this is because one of the beauties of having a Graph is you now get access to new ways of thinking and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.280</a></span> | <span class="t">understanding about the data that you have. And so my goal today is to have everybody feel comfortable</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.960</a></span> | <span class="t">with some of the basics of the algorithms of Graph. And, you know, hopefully while you're working through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.520</a></span> | <span class="t">this, you can see something that's going to be of interest. There might be something that you want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.840</a></span> | <span class="t">try when you get back to your application. I do this a lot, and I will say the most successful workshops</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.960</a></span> | <span class="t">we have are when people bring their real-world scenarios to bear. So we will be going over the code,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.240</a></span> | <span class="t">but a lot of what we're going to be doing is talking through the concepts and around</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Graph as a tool for managing your RAG. And we're really just going to be talking about Graph algorithms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Anybody here come from the data science side of things? Oh, all right, we got a few, we got a few.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.840</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the things that I think is really interesting about the term AI engineer is, you know, somebody</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.240</a></span> | <span class="t">said, "Oh, it's just engineering. Like, it's still pipelines." I'm like, "No, it's not. It's different."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? I came initially from the AI side, and I can tell you that none of us, none of us look at things the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.880</a></span> | <span class="t">same way that we did, you know, a few years back. It isn't the data scientists on one side and people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.160</a></span> | <span class="t">putting things into production on the other. You know, we work really closely. And so what my hope</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.320</a></span> | <span class="t">now is like the, there's this concept that people say all the time that, you know, developers are just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.680</a></span> | <span class="t">building the pipes and that the data scientists are worried about the quality of the water inside the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.480</a></span> | <span class="t">pipe. But with AI engineers, we're all worried about the pipes and the water, right? So what I really want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.040</a></span> | <span class="t">is to give you as much as I can about the algorithms and about the data science and get us rolling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=328" target="_blank">00:05:28.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So let me see. Where's my repo? Where's my repo? Okay. Um, yeah. So just clone this repo. You can,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=334" target="_blank">00:05:34.760</a></span> | <span class="t">you'll have it. We'll, we're going to walk through it. It's, um, it's, it's really just like a click</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.160</a></span> | <span class="t">through of a number of Jupyter notebooks. Um, but really like, it's all mostly about the conversation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=345" target="_blank">00:05:45.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that we're going to have today is where we're going. So obviously everybody here, like we always start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.160</a></span> | <span class="t">with the basics, right? I call them the, the GPS moments that let's review all the things everybody knows</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=355" target="_blank">00:05:55.560</a></span> | <span class="t">first. Um, we know that in our rag applications, what we're really trying to do is we're really,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=361" target="_blank">00:06:01.240</a></span> | <span class="t">we're getting better answers, right? That's what everybody here is struggling with. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.200</a></span> | <span class="t">like some of the common things I hear people struggle with are, um, am I getting the right data? Do I have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=372" target="_blank">00:06:12.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the right chunking strategy? Um, how do I handle temporal data? How do I handle data quality? Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=379" target="_blank">00:06:19.880</a></span> | <span class="t">what are, what are some of your biggest like rag challenges? Anybody want to share?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.920</a></span> | <span class="t">That what just irks you about what you've been working on? Everybody's so quiet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I should have signed up a Slack channel. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=391" target="_blank">00:06:31.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're definitely going to talk about, we're going to talk about that today. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=407" target="_blank">00:06:47.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I think one of the things that we found is that the management is, um, what? Oh, sorry. Um, the,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=414" target="_blank">00:06:54.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the comment was, um, how to handle the volume of the data was a really big one. And the other element</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=421" target="_blank">00:07:01.240</a></span> | <span class="t">was understanding the relationships among the data. So did you go to this morning's workshop?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=427" target="_blank">00:07:07.240</a></span> | <span class="t">No. Okay. Well, you'll, we have lots of video on it, so we can, we can definitely get that to you.

Yes. Yeah. Temporal is a really interesting thing. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=439" target="_blank">00:07:19.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't, I didn't, I don't have temporal in the slides, but we can definitely talk about temporal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=443" target="_blank">00:07:23.960</a></span> | <span class="t">because it's really important for sure. Um, one of the things that we find is, you know, I, I will,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=449" target="_blank">00:07:29.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I will give you my apologies up front. I get super excited about graphs. So I apologize in advance if I am</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=456" target="_blank">00:07:36.760</a></span> | <span class="t">overly enthusiastic about what I do because I love graphs. And there's so many times where something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=463" target="_blank">00:07:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">comes up and you're like, Oh, well, if you use graph, you could address it this way. So I just want to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=467" target="_blank">00:07:47.880</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, keep bringing these things up and let's talk through all of them. But what we're really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=472" target="_blank">00:07:52.920</a></span> | <span class="t">looking at is how do we give this complete and curated response, right? What are we using for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=479" target="_blank">00:07:59.560</a></span> | <span class="t">the external data? I mean, initially everybody drops their stuff into Pinecone or WeVA, you hit a vector</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=485" target="_blank">00:08:05.480</a></span> | <span class="t">store. Um, is anybody now working with multiple databases feeding into their RAG system? A little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=492" target="_blank">00:08:12.840</a></span> | <span class="t">bit. Yeah. Still primarily vectors, primarily vectors. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, everybody uses vectors</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=499" target="_blank">00:08:19.880</a></span> | <span class="t">because they work right. Um, and that's the starting point. But the thing about the vector</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=504" target="_blank">00:08:24.600</a></span> | <span class="t">is the vector really is, I, the analogy I always say is it's like you have a bunch of little index</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.960</a></span> | <span class="t">cards. And so imagine if I'm the, my first day on the job and everything there is to know about my,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=514" target="_blank">00:08:34.760</a></span> | <span class="t">is that what I have to do is on an index card. And I say, Oh, well, what do I know about this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=519" target="_blank">00:08:39.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And then somebody finds the index card with this little blurb. And so like, I've just got these little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=523" target="_blank">00:08:43.800</a></span> | <span class="t">things, but I don't understand how it all puts together. Right. We don't understand what is it connected</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=528" target="_blank">00:08:48.600</a></span> | <span class="t">to, right? What is it connected to? What context do we need? And so what I want you to start thinking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=535" target="_blank">00:08:55.320</a></span> | <span class="t">about is what are the projects that you've already been working on? When you're getting those answers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=540" target="_blank">00:09:00.760</a></span> | <span class="t">back, what are some of the pieces of information that you wish your vector had? Right. Anybody have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=548" target="_blank">00:09:08.200</a></span> | <span class="t">an idea of something they, you don't have to share, but like you've thought about like, Oh, if only it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=552" target="_blank">00:09:12.200</a></span> | <span class="t">could do this, right? If only it knew about that, I would get a much better answer. If you haven't,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=557" target="_blank">00:09:17.720</a></span> | <span class="t">then I'm sure like the, your business folks that you're responding to have because they always have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=562" target="_blank">00:09:22.200</a></span> | <span class="t">an opinion. Right. So one of the things about the knowledge graph is that it's a way for us to bring</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=569" target="_blank">00:09:29.720</a></span> | <span class="t">our structured data and our unstructured data together. The other thing that it will do is it will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=576" target="_blank">00:09:36.280</a></span> | <span class="t">actually find knowledge inside of your unstructured documents, right? So one of the things you brought</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=582" target="_blank">00:09:42.520</a></span> | <span class="t">up was how do we create the relationships among these documents or among these pieces of information?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=588" target="_blank">00:09:48.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's a couple of ways that happens. One is it's really explicit, right? There's a table of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=595" target="_blank">00:09:55.720</a></span> | <span class="t">information inside this document and you can pull that out, right? Old school regex, everybody's friend,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=601" target="_blank">00:10:01.480</a></span> | <span class="t">or it's something that is less explicit and more implicit. And that's where the LLMs come in,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=609" target="_blank">00:10:09.160</a></span> | <span class="t">finding out what is in there. So in this morning's one, and if you want to hit us up, we can definitely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=615" target="_blank">00:10:15.640</a></span> | <span class="t">show you how we actually extract and build the knowledge graph. What we're working with today</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=620" target="_blank">00:10:20.760</a></span> | <span class="t">is I have a database already set for you folks that is a data dump that we're going to load into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=626" target="_blank">00:10:26.840</a></span> | <span class="t">your pro trials. But the thing is this data comes from lots of different places.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=631" target="_blank">00:10:31.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So I guess most people here are familiar with the graph, but just in case I do like my little GPS</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=639" target="_blank">00:10:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">moments, let's talk about all the things we already know. What is a graph, right? Basically we start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=644" target="_blank">00:10:44.760</a></span> | <span class="t">with nodes. Nodes are entities, they're your nouns, they're your items. Some people relate them to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=651" target="_blank">00:10:51.160</a></span> | <span class="t">tables in your relational database. These are your table names, right? But the important thing is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=657" target="_blank">00:10:57.320</a></span> | <span class="t">relationships among those entities. So a customer and a product, a product and a part, a supplier and a buyer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=665" target="_blank">00:11:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's the relationships in and among these pieces of information that's where our business and where our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=670" target="_blank">00:11:10.520</a></span> | <span class="t">information lives. In this case, we've got two people. One of them owns a car, one of them drives the car.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=675" target="_blank">00:11:15.720</a></span> | <span class="t">They do know each other. I'm not sure why person one lives with person two, but not the other way around.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=680" target="_blank">00:11:20.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Who knows? Life is interesting, right? So we have these relationships and this tells us what is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=687" target="_blank">00:11:27.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the story of the interaction between and among these. And properties. This is where we get into the nitty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=696" target="_blank">00:11:36.040</a></span> | <span class="t">gritty. We get into the details. These are those extra columns within the table, right? Our relationships are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=702" target="_blank">00:11:42.200</a></span> | <span class="t">our foreign keys. Our properties are the columns. The entities are the tables, like roughly, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=708" target="_blank">00:11:48.760</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, don't quote me on it, but pretty close, right? As from a conceptual point. These properties</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=715" target="_blank">00:11:55.160</a></span> | <span class="t">can live on the entities. They can also live on the relationships, right? So we can see that this person</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=722" target="_blank">00:12:02.040</a></span> | <span class="t">has been driving the car since this date. It's a very old car now. But one of the other things that we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=727" target="_blank">00:12:07.960</a></span> | <span class="t">going to see is we see underneath this car, we see a couple of things. We've got the brand,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=734" target="_blank">00:12:14.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the model. We have a description of the car. And what you'll see underneath is the description embedding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=740" target="_blank">00:12:20.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're all familiar with the embeddings, right? The embedding is a way of taking some piece of text,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=745" target="_blank">00:12:25.720</a></span> | <span class="t">putting it into, you know, many, many dimensions, and creating a vector in space that represents the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=752" target="_blank">00:12:32.600</a></span> | <span class="t">semantics of whatever that text is. One of the things that's really great about a graph</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=760" target="_blank">00:12:40.200</a></span> | <span class="t">is that you have immediately that connection from the embedding to all of the other information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=766" target="_blank">00:12:46.600</a></span> | <span class="t">We see it in this microcosm here of the car, the embedding of the car. And you can pretty quickly see,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=772" target="_blank">00:12:52.760</a></span> | <span class="t">oh, if I did a vector search on, you know, this car, right? And I wanted to know who are the people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=780" target="_blank">00:13:00.280</a></span> | <span class="t">that own cars described like X, it's a pretty quick traversal. You're going to do a vector search. It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=786" target="_blank">00:13:06.200</a></span> | <span class="t">going to take you to that node, that entity, right? Similar to your chunks that you've already been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=791" target="_blank">00:13:11.640</a></span> | <span class="t">working with. But immediately, you already have all the relationships built in because they're already in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=796" target="_blank">00:13:16.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the database, right? We don't have to, we don't have to like create new tables and views. Everything's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=802" target="_blank">00:13:22.440</a></span> | <span class="t">already there and it's connected. So when you go into graph rag and you're working with your retrievers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=808" target="_blank">00:13:28.920</a></span> | <span class="t">the beauty of the retriever is in this ability to traverse and traverse very quickly and get that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=815" target="_blank">00:13:35.880</a></span> | <span class="t">immediate context, right? So these are the basic components of what we're going to be working with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=822" target="_blank">00:13:42.360</a></span> | <span class="t">within the database. So we're going to start at the very beginning, right? How does this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=827" target="_blank">00:13:47.960</a></span> | <span class="t">how does this work? We start with the entity. The first entity is the document and the document has a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=832" target="_blank">00:13:52.680</a></span> | <span class="t">chunk, right? Pretty straightforward. It's a row in your vector store, right? But this is the interesting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=840" target="_blank">00:14:00.920</a></span> | <span class="t">thing. You also have like, anybody here working with agents already? MCP servers? Yeah. The other thing that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=849" target="_blank">00:14:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">we get and what we're going to be talking a lot about today is the application. I call it the application</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=854" target="_blank">00:14:14.600</a></span> | <span class="t">graph. Like they call it a memory graph. For me, it's what is the actual activity that's happening</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=859" target="_blank">00:14:19.720</a></span> | <span class="t">in the system? What is, what is it doing? What are the messages going in and out? What are the context</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=866" target="_blank">00:14:26.760</a></span> | <span class="t">documents that are being used, right? Everything that we're building is moving quickly and it's moving at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=873" target="_blank">00:14:33.640</a></span> | <span class="t">volume. There's massive amounts of documents and data. There's so much volume. How do we actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=880" target="_blank">00:14:40.680</a></span> | <span class="t">manage it? What do we do? This is going to be a key part of what we talk about today, which is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=886" target="_blank">00:14:46.920</a></span> | <span class="t">actual understanding of what's happening in the application and how by monitoring and looking at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=892" target="_blank">00:14:52.920</a></span> | <span class="t">what's going on in the application, you can do things like manage your documents at scale. You can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=899" target="_blank">00:14:59.080</a></span> | <span class="t">understand what are the actual important documents, what's influencing outcomes, right? I've got some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=906" target="_blank">00:15:06.680</a></span> | <span class="t">good stories to share with you about what people have been working on. One of the things you mentioned</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=911" target="_blank">00:15:11.560</a></span> | <span class="t">is what other elements are there. So when we look at the entirety of the graph, we have like the memory</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=916" target="_blank">00:15:16.120</a></span> | <span class="t">graph for the application. It's connected to the chunks and then those chunks are connected to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=920" target="_blank">00:15:20.600</a></span> | <span class="t">domain, the products, the people, and basically all the other structured pieces of your business or the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=926" target="_blank">00:15:26.120</a></span> | <span class="t">structured elements that you've extracted from those unstructured documents.

We're all together now, right? We all work together and the way that we have to build is we build from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=955" target="_blank">00:15:55.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that cohesive point. We build from the data and the application at the same time. So I'm just going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=960" target="_blank">00:16:00.120</a></span> | <span class="t">to show you what becomes possible as you start taking this kind of an approach. Everything that we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=966" target="_blank">00:16:06.440</a></span> | <span class="t">looking at today is just this little bit of the graph, right? So we're going to be looking at prompts and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=971" target="_blank">00:16:11.400</a></span> | <span class="t">responses and we're going to be looking at the context documents that they're connected to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=976" target="_blank">00:16:16.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and then from there we're going to say, okay, let's figure out where we go now and what we can start to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=981" target="_blank">00:16:21.960</a></span> | <span class="t">understand. Anybody have any questions so far? All sounds really obvious, like why are you still talking about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=989" target="_blank">00:16:29.560</a></span> | <span class="t">this? Too slow, too fast, are we good? You're good, okay, all right, good pacing. If I go too fast because I'm from New York, I'm a fast talker, let me know. If you're getting bored, just kind of give me one of these and be like, okay, let's go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1004" target="_blank">00:16:44.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's fine, too. But the best thing that you can do is like when you have a question,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1010" target="_blank">00:16:50.520</a></span> | <span class="t">just raise your hand because everybody has the same kinds of questions. Everybody's struggling with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1014" target="_blank">00:16:54.920</a></span> | <span class="t">things. And what I love about AI engineer is I get to be with the people who are doing the things that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1021" target="_blank">00:17:01.400</a></span> | <span class="t">are like you are the people that are making everything happen right now, right? I mean, our entire world is in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1026" target="_blank">00:17:06.680</a></span> | <span class="t">like just this incredible transformation and you all are the people that are building it. And so I want to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1032" target="_blank">00:17:12.280</a></span> | <span class="t">here to support you in this moment because it's a pretty exciting time. So please don't be shy. Questions, comments? Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1043" target="_blank">00:17:23.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, I will drop it in. It's not in right now, but I will drop it in before we leave. Thanks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1049" target="_blank">00:17:29.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. All right. Um, yeah, so they're all the same system. They're really just sort of like neighborhoods,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1065" target="_blank">00:17:45.640</a></span> | <span class="t">right? They're kind of neighborhoods in the system. Um, the reason that we draw it out is because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1071" target="_blank">00:17:51.640</a></span> | <span class="t">oftentimes people think of them as separate, right? So, um, this one doesn't have everything,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1078" target="_blank">00:17:58.280</a></span> | <span class="t">but what we see here is we've got, this has a, this one has the source. So the yellow nodes are things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1083" target="_blank">00:18:03.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that are coming from your application. The blues came from unstructured data. Um, we're not doing it today,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1088" target="_blank">00:18:08.920</a></span> | <span class="t">but if you had structured data that you were also pulling in, like, uh, bringing in a table, bringing in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1094" target="_blank">00:18:14.040</a></span> | <span class="t">some of, or whether it's, you know, already structured or has been brought out of your unstructured data,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1100" target="_blank">00:18:20.120</a></span> | <span class="t">that would be just a different color. It's all one system. But the reason that we do this is just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1105" target="_blank">00:18:25.720</a></span> | <span class="t">so that people conceptually understand where it's coming from and like, what does it do? Because the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1111" target="_blank">00:18:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">big thing really is understanding the fact that once it's all connected, your application is talking to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1118" target="_blank">00:18:38.920</a></span> | <span class="t">all of the data and then you're structured and you're unstructured are all working together. And at any time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1124" target="_blank">00:18:44.520</a></span> | <span class="t">you have access to understanding across that system. It's like, you know, complex systems and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1129" target="_blank">00:18:49.960</a></span> | <span class="t">system thinking and all that good juiciness. So they're not separate. They're just neighborhoods. Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1136" target="_blank">00:18:56.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So, so, um, what you are...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1138" target="_blank">00:18:58.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Are you proposing that you have like one massive graph?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1143" target="_blank">00:19:03.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1144" target="_blank">00:19:04.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1145" target="_blank">00:19:05.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, don't start with a massive graph, right? Like, let's be honest. Let's start with something small.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1150" target="_blank">00:19:10.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, my first piece of advice is always start small. Um, the other thing to really, as always, we always want to look at optimization. We want to make sure that we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1159" target="_blank">00:19:19.800</a></span> | <span class="t">we're building for the latency that we need. There's always going to be context. Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1163" target="_blank">00:19:23.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Can you elaborate on that? They mentioned it this morning as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1166" target="_blank">00:19:26.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1167" target="_blank">00:19:27.240</a></span> | <span class="t">To start small.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1167" target="_blank">00:19:27.240</a></span> | <span class="t">But when you're trying to map, for example, the ontology of, of an organization and be able to have an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1172" target="_blank">00:19:32.680</a></span> | <span class="t">assistant have access to that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1173" target="_blank">00:19:33.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1173" target="_blank">00:19:33.240</a></span> | <span class="t">We've always had to go big.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1175" target="_blank">00:19:35.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1175" target="_blank">00:19:35.240</a></span> | <span class="t">How do you, how do you, how do you do small? Just break it apart?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1179" target="_blank">00:19:39.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.

So some of the complexity like for, for really big graphs, part of the bigness of it is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1190" target="_blank">00:19:50.280</a></span> | <span class="t">not just the number of nodes and relationships you have, but the number of labels and relationship</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1194" target="_blank">00:19:54.360</a></span> | <span class="t">types that you have. And for like a large organization, don't over specify. So you start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1199" target="_blank">00:19:59.960</a></span> | <span class="t">up with like kind of generic terms, see if that works. And if you've got too many, too much volume in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1205" target="_blank">00:20:05.240</a></span> | <span class="t">generic terms to segment, then you get more specific. And so, and the other part about that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1210" target="_blank">00:20:10.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I suppose, is that you start with not all of the data, but like some of the data, work with it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1215" target="_blank">00:20:15.160</a></span> | <span class="t">do some eval, figure out if it's doing what you want to, and then refine before you suck in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1219" target="_blank">00:20:19.720</a></span> | <span class="t">everything and create the entire database. So you kind of iterate on the schema with a subset of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1225" target="_blank">00:20:25.240</a></span> | <span class="t">data. It's normal data engineering, I guess, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1227" target="_blank">00:20:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1227" target="_blank">00:20:27.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Do just some of the data, start generic, and then get more specific. Yep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1231" target="_blank">00:20:31.720</a></span> | <span class="t">When you say big versus small, you're talking ontology, not knowledge graph, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1242" target="_blank">00:20:42.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Correct. Yeah, that's right. So on, so talking about the ontology or the schema,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1246" target="_blank">00:20:46.200</a></span> | <span class="t">like the, how the graph is actually laid out, rather than the number of each kinds of things,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1250" target="_blank">00:20:50.920</a></span> | <span class="t">right? So starting there, iterating on that first, and then bringing all the data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1254" target="_blank">00:20:54.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1254" target="_blank">00:20:54.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1256" target="_blank">00:20:56.200</a></span> | <span class="t">What are your thoughts on the raptor indexes?

What</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1298" target="_blank">00:21:38.600</a></span> | <span class="t">are the questions people are going to ask?

So, like, there's plenty of help</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1916" target="_blank">00:31:56.760</a></span> | <span class="t">for all of this within our co-pilots. But depending on what you get back, in this case, you can look at it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1923" target="_blank">00:32:03.080</a></span> | <span class="t">as a graph. You can see the table. Or you can see, you know, just the raw values, but the graph itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1929" target="_blank">00:32:09.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So in this case, we're looking at a particular document, which is actually, you know, we call it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1934" target="_blank">00:32:14.520</a></span> | <span class="t">a document. It's really the chunk. I will tell you that what we have in our, what we, the data that we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1941" target="_blank">00:32:21.160</a></span> | <span class="t">working with is from a project that we actually have live. And it's called Agent Neo. And it was built a while ago</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1949" target="_blank">00:32:29.800</a></span> | <span class="t">now with, by some of the guys who were helping build the first RAG application on our graph data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1955" target="_blank">00:32:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">science platform. And our knowledge share there. So this has been in play for a while. But when we look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1961" target="_blank">00:32:41.480</a></span> | <span class="t">at the data model itself, right, what you're going to see is what I talked about before, right? That</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1965" target="_blank">00:32:45.400</a></span> | <span class="t">application understanding. So we've got a session. So somebody logs in to the application.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1970" target="_blank">00:32:50.360</a></span> | <span class="t">They start a conversation. They have their first message, right? This is the user prompt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1975" target="_blank">00:32:55.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Then that prompt is going to get an answer, right? There's a message that comes back from the assistant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1981" target="_blank">00:33:01.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And then that assistant is going to be going out and pulling in context documents, right? So it's going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1988" target="_blank">00:33:08.360</a></span> | <span class="t">to do your cosine similarity. Who does Euclidean? I don't know. It's a thing, I guess. Does your cosine similarity,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=1995" target="_blank">00:33:15.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and it's going to bring those documents back? And we're going to start to see the chain of what that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2000" target="_blank">00:33:20.280</a></span> | <span class="t">conversation looks like, right? So this is that application base. And then these are the chunks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2006" target="_blank">00:33:26.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's really just what we looked at in that previous view, but just to show you what it actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2010" target="_blank">00:33:30.840</a></span> | <span class="t">looks like. So what's in this? You know, lots of documents from our documentation, developer blogs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2018" target="_blank">00:33:38.520</a></span> | <span class="t">support. This was early on, our earliest chunking. We had a 512 chunk size. We used a Langchain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2026" target="_blank">00:33:46.360</a></span> | <span class="t">recursive splitter. So it was pretty early on. Let me see. Hold on a second. I want to show you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2031" target="_blank">00:33:51.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Where am I? Oh, that's not what I want to show you. Where did it go?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2038" target="_blank">00:33:58.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Here we go. All right. So once the system actually starts running, what you see is this is actually one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2052" target="_blank">00:34:12.600</a></span> | <span class="t">user having two different conversations. This is their first conversation. This is their second</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2057" target="_blank">00:34:17.240</a></span> | <span class="t">conversation. The first question is, can you build graphs for me? And then the next one was, what is GDS?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2063" target="_blank">00:34:23.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you see the beginning of what that response was. Yes, I can build for you. GDS stands for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2069" target="_blank">00:34:29.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you can just to give you an idea of how this starts to build out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2074" target="_blank">00:34:34.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, this might look a little bit frightening, but I'll walk you through what we're actually looking at.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2079" target="_blank">00:34:39.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So what does it mean when we start looking in practice? So this is the same user, right, with those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2084" target="_blank">00:34:44.120</a></span> | <span class="t">initial two conversations. What does graph data science? Yeah, what is GDS? This is also what is GDS?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2092" target="_blank">00:34:52.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And then can you build graphs for me? And what we're looking at here is these are the conversations</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2098" target="_blank">00:34:58.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and these are the context documents that are being brought in. And what's interesting or plausible,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2103" target="_blank">00:35:03.960</a></span> | <span class="t">it makes sense, this person asked the same opening question. So it stands to reason that these same</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2109" target="_blank">00:35:09.080</a></span> | <span class="t">documents are going to be used in both of these first responses, right? Makes sense. Then what we find is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2116" target="_blank">00:35:16.040</a></span> | <span class="t">this person's next conversation says, how can I have, how can I learn more about GDS is their follow-up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2124" target="_blank">00:35:24.680</a></span> | <span class="t">question, right? And that makes sense that it's going to now share things with, can you build,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2131" target="_blank">00:35:31.640</a></span> | <span class="t">because this person is then having their next prompt, which is, oh no, that one just stopped after one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2138" target="_blank">00:35:38.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But what I wanted to show you is that what we see here is that in this middle conversation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2143" target="_blank">00:35:43.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the conversation started out in this area of information, right? It started out in what is GDS,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2149" target="_blank">00:35:49.800</a></span> | <span class="t">what are some of the basics, but then the conversation went into something similar to someone else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2155" target="_blank">00:35:55.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reason that we want you to see this is you want to be able to see how are the conversations</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2162" target="_blank">00:36:02.680</a></span> | <span class="t">connecting to the data itself. Because what we're going to start to see is we're going to start to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2167" target="_blank">00:36:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">see that it's not just about a single row, it's not just about a vector, because the way the documents</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2172" target="_blank">00:36:12.440</a></span> | <span class="t">are used and the way people travel through your data gives you information about what they're using.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2177" target="_blank">00:36:17.480</a></span> | <span class="t">The reason that becomes helpful is when you're trying to manage at scale, how do I know with all these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2183" target="_blank">00:36:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">documents, what are the ones that I should even be looking at? What is it that people are constantly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2187" target="_blank">00:36:27.640</a></span> | <span class="t">going back to? What are the areas of knowledge where things are happening? And so what we're seeing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2193" target="_blank">00:36:33.480</a></span> | <span class="t">here is that these elements right here were in both answers, right? So you see this first question had,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2200" target="_blank">00:36:40.040</a></span> | <span class="t">this first response had context, and this had context. So it was in both of those. These are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2205" target="_blank">00:36:45.080</a></span> | <span class="t">individuals, these over here were only in this one, some of those were only in that one. You can imagine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2210" target="_blank">00:36:50.600</a></span> | <span class="t">like how quickly this gets very, very hairy. Oh, where did it go? Nope. I guess that's it. I didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2216" target="_blank">00:36:56.920</a></span> | <span class="t">have the extra one. So the point is we can start to understand the movement of what's happening. Is there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2224" target="_blank">00:37:04.760</a></span> | <span class="t">a question? Someone? No? Okay. Anybody have any questions so far? Ponderings. Waiting till we get to juicy things. Yes?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2233" target="_blank">00:37:13.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes. Yes. The pink ones are the chunks. The orange is the user prompt. The tan is the rag application's response.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2250" target="_blank">00:37:30.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can already see how it's starting to connect to the system itself, right? So let me get back</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2256" target="_blank">00:37:36.680</a></span> | <span class="t">on point here. We got things. We got things. Things, things, things, things, things. Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2261" target="_blank">00:37:41.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm sorry. Are you storing the entire chunk into the graph? And how performant is that? And when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2267" target="_blank">00:37:47.320</a></span> | <span class="t">does performance become a concern? Yeah. So what we're going to see is we are actually,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2272" target="_blank">00:37:52.440</a></span> | <span class="t">we do actually have the chunk. Our chunks are pretty small. The size of the text doesn't really change the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2281" target="_blank">00:38:01.720</a></span> | <span class="t">performance, does it? Like as far as like once it's stored in the property. It's really the traversal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2288" target="_blank">00:38:08.200</a></span> | <span class="t">that is where things get. For most chunk sizes, it's fine. Because most chunks are like in the K</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2292" target="_blank">00:38:12.920</a></span> | <span class="t">at most. It's not megabytes of chunk. Right. If there's megabytes, then it's like, okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2296" target="_blank">00:38:16.360</a></span> | <span class="t">that becomes problematic. Yeah. I mean, but it would be that for any database I would imagine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2300" target="_blank">00:38:20.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. But what we see is, is like, you know, we said we had these properties. So for this particular</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2308" target="_blank">00:38:28.360</a></span> | <span class="t">document, I've run some of these things already, but we've got the document, we've got the text,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2313" target="_blank">00:38:33.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and we have the embedding. The embedding is actually a property of the node itself. And that's one of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2319" target="_blank">00:38:39.720</a></span> | <span class="t">things that makes it really easy is that you don't have to have a separate vector database, right? The</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2326" target="_blank">00:38:46.040</a></span> | <span class="t">vector is actually stored, and then the vector index is built on top. So that once you get all those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2330" target="_blank">00:38:50.520</a></span> | <span class="t">vectors in, you can run the vector index. And people do really interesting things with vector indexes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2334" target="_blank">00:38:54.840</a></span> | <span class="t">for sure. So this is where, well, that's not what I want. This is where we start. Yes?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2341" target="_blank">00:39:01.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Question in the back. I think, I think I have a question, so.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2345" target="_blank">00:39:05.640</a></span> | <span class="t">You definitely have a question. Whether I have an answer is the only thing that's up for debate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2350" target="_blank">00:39:10.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's assume, right, I have very large, let's say, legal documents, right, which I'm trying to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2356" target="_blank">00:39:16.200</a></span> | <span class="t">something very similar. Yeah. And I do these chunkings, you know. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2360" target="_blank">00:39:20.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Are you saying I would store the chunks in Neo4j? I would not store the vectors in a vector database,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2367" target="_blank">00:39:27.160</a></span> | <span class="t">but I would also store that in Neo4j. Yeah. Now, how would that be from a performance standpoint over time?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2372" target="_blank">00:39:32.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, assuming your system continues to grow, wouldn't there be a performance impact?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2379" target="_blank">00:39:39.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, I don't know. Would you know what the largest RAG application is that we have in production in clients right now?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2385" target="_blank">00:39:45.960</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a good question. I don't know. I know that's like, you know, tens of millions, you know, seems fine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2389" target="_blank">00:39:49.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Once you start to get into hundreds of millions, you might start to have to worry about, like, how to scale past that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2394" target="_blank">00:39:54.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes. And does it still worry across -- look for similarity across all embeddings?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2400" target="_blank">00:40:00.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. I mean, so it depends. So what it will do is it will look across whatever the vector index is that you have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2407" target="_blank">00:40:07.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And there are people who, I said, they do some really interesting things with vector indices.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2411" target="_blank">00:40:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I've seen people who, like, have multiple vector indices depending on what the use case is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2418" target="_blank">00:40:18.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So when you create the vector index, you actually just do a query and you say, "Okay, for all of these,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2424" target="_blank">00:40:24.600</a></span> | <span class="t">create an index on all of these nodes." And so that's one way that I definitely know people have been doing it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2430" target="_blank">00:40:30.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So they'll have multiple indices that already sort of pre-sort or pre-filter what's going to be part of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2436" target="_blank">00:40:36.600</a></span> | <span class="t">what's coming back from the vector index. So I know one of the ways I've seen people do it is from a governance perspective.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2442" target="_blank">00:40:42.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's certain data that they want available to everybody, certain data they don't,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2446" target="_blank">00:40:46.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and they manage that from the vector index.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2448" target="_blank">00:40:48.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, please. I'll let you go for a third, really.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2453" target="_blank">00:40:53.880</a></span> | <span class="t">The other question is, if we had documents that actually contained images,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2460" target="_blank">00:41:00.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and we wanted to somewhat have a relationship between the text and images, how would you do it here?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2465" target="_blank">00:41:05.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Does that make sense?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2466" target="_blank">00:41:06.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. I mean, normally, multimodal, I think most of the time they keep the images separate,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2471" target="_blank">00:41:11.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and then there's an embedding of the image on the node.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2474" target="_blank">00:41:14.760</a></span> | <span class="t">That's right. That's right. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2475" target="_blank">00:41:15.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so you put the images, like, large media files, you would put that in an S3 bucket or something,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2479" target="_blank">00:41:19.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you still wouldn't, you wouldn't put that into the database. So you'd have a URL to the S3 bucket,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2484" target="_blank">00:41:24.200</a></span> | <span class="t">but you can put the embedding into Neo4j, so on the node. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2487" target="_blank">00:41:27.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Yeah. We actually have an example of that. Yeah?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2492" target="_blank">00:41:32.760</a></span> | <span class="t">For, like, for, like, you have, like, multi-layered architecture to kind of query faster. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2501" target="_blank">00:41:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Is there something similar to that happening here, where you can have, like, different subsets, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2507" target="_blank">00:41:47.800</a></span> | <span class="t">different layers to the... Yeah, I mean, it's not... I mean, it's mostly just the way that the database is actually built.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2514" target="_blank">00:41:54.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Because of the way the queries run, because you're running on a pattern, you actually...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2519" target="_blank">00:41:59.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I kind of call it a... It's like GPS search, where it's like, start here, and then go find what you need to find.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2525" target="_blank">00:42:05.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? So, I don't know if that's the best way to explain that, but when you're running the query,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2532" target="_blank">00:42:12.680</a></span> | <span class="t">it's going to be very specific. So when you're thinking about, like, how you're running the vector</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2538" target="_blank">00:42:18.680</a></span> | <span class="t">retriever itself, are you talking about, like, when you're actually doing the retrieval from the vectors?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2542" target="_blank">00:42:22.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So there's a whole... I don't even know how many retrievers there are right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2547" target="_blank">00:42:27.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Like eight different retrievers or something in the GraphRag package. It's a Python-based package.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2553" target="_blank">00:42:33.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So there are some... If you go to... Actually, a great place to go is GraphRag.com. It's like an open,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2559" target="_blank">00:42:39.240</a></span> | <span class="t">like, reference point. And it talks about some of the different types of retrievers. So you can do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2564" target="_blank">00:42:44.040</a></span> | <span class="t">pre-filtering. You can do post-filtering. You can manage it based on the index, which is another, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2569" target="_blank">00:42:49.240</a></span> | <span class="t">easy way to do it. You know, sometimes folks will have them where they have different hierarchies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2575" target="_blank">00:42:55.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So, like, when you think about these large legal documents, right, there are ways that you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2581" target="_blank">00:43:01.080</a></span> | <span class="t">actually, like, create the chunks, but use the natural structure of the element as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2587" target="_blank">00:43:07.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So, like, we have an example we use with SEC data. Every time somebody files something with the SEC,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2592" target="_blank">00:43:12.840</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, paragraph one is always this, paragraph seven is that, paragraph nine is that. And so you'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2597" target="_blank">00:43:17.240</a></span> | <span class="t">take whatever that natural architecture is within the documents themselves, and then you can leverage that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2603" target="_blank">00:43:23.240</a></span> | <span class="t">as well. So, one of the other great things about these entities is that you can actually have more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2610" target="_blank">00:43:30.280</a></span> | <span class="t">than one label. Let me see. Oh, I gotta plug in. So, one of the things that you'll see is, so for this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2623" target="_blank">00:43:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">particular... This particular one, we see that it's a message, but it's also noted that it's the assistant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2630" target="_blank">00:43:50.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you have some nodes that are, that have more than one label sometimes. So, it makes it so that if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2637" target="_blank">00:43:57.720</a></span> | <span class="t">you wanted to go across all messages, but I know if I'm trying to understand just the prompts from,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2644" target="_blank">00:44:04.440</a></span> | <span class="t">they're just the assistant answers, or just the prompts, I don't need all of those messages. So, by adding on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2649" target="_blank">00:44:09.720</a></span> | <span class="t">dual labels, you can actually say, "Oh, I just want to see these, or I just want to see those." So, it allows you to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2656" target="_blank">00:44:16.680</a></span> | <span class="t">get some of that nuance out of that complexity by leveraging multiple labels on a single node.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2662" target="_blank">00:44:22.040</a></span> | <span class="t">One of my favorite tricks, personally, but that's just me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2665" target="_blank">00:44:25.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I have a question. So, now, like, if you have one vector index, but don't want to actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2676" target="_blank">00:44:36.040</a></span> | <span class="t">search the entire index, right? So, since that, like, let's take this text, for example, or like, content,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2681" target="_blank">00:44:41.400</a></span> | <span class="t">for example. You want to only search the content of few nodes while vector embedding. Is that possible?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2690" target="_blank">00:44:50.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, there's a number of ways that you can do that. You know, you certainly could. I mean, I,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2696" target="_blank">00:44:56.680</a></span> | <span class="t">personally, I'm a big fan of multiple indices, just because I find them to be very efficient.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2701" target="_blank">00:45:01.080</a></span> | <span class="t">That's one way to do it. There was a question earlier about temporal issues. You can also use, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2711" target="_blank">00:45:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">multiple vector indices to address that temporal portion as well, right? So, you can create an index</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2717" target="_blank">00:45:17.480</a></span> | <span class="t">from, why is this? All right, it's starting up. You can create a vector index. So, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2723" target="_blank">00:45:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">like, if we wanted to, like, if we wanted to have a vector index just on, you know, version 1.9 or version</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2731" target="_blank">00:45:31.640</a></span> | <span class="t">2.6 or whatever, you could have that particular vector. So, let's just say I'm building,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2736" target="_blank">00:45:36.520</a></span> | <span class="t">building a chat bot, and I know that the customer is currently running whatever version of something,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2742" target="_blank">00:45:42.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you can use that as the actual index that you're searching for. So, that's another way that you can,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2749" target="_blank">00:45:49.880</a></span> | <span class="t">that you can address those kinds of things. Did that answer your question?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2753" target="_blank">00:45:53.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it's just like multiple embeddings, I mean, multiple indices. So, not one index.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2758" target="_blank">00:45:58.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, I don't know. I don't know if engineering would agree with me, but from, like, a purely, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2763" target="_blank">00:46:03.240</a></span> | <span class="t">practical, like, I got to hack this and get it done, that's my go-to. I mean, is there?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2770" target="_blank">00:46:10.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I think that's the right approach right now with Neo4j. I guess you're asking about metadata</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2775" target="_blank">00:46:15.560</a></span> | <span class="t">filtering within the vector index, right? Yeah, and so, for us, the vector index is just an index.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2780" target="_blank">00:46:20.440</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not a vector search. Right. And so, we don't do metadata filtering on the vector itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2785" target="_blank">00:46:25.960</a></span> | <span class="t">We use the property graph itself for doing the filtering. Right. So, you do it before you create</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2791" target="_blank">00:46:31.240</a></span> | <span class="t">the index, because the index is only going to go to what's connected to it, right? So, it's just...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2797" target="_blank">00:46:37.160</a></span> | <span class="t">You'll still have the index, but then you can do predicates on top of the nodes you found,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2800" target="_blank">00:46:40.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and then you filter after that. Yeah. So, even within, once you get that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2804" target="_blank">00:46:44.200</a></span> | <span class="t">you can certainly filter in and around that as well. And if you look at any of our,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2809" target="_blank">00:46:49.240</a></span> | <span class="t">the vector retriever materials we have, like, we walk you through that. We've got a new ebook coming out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2814" target="_blank">00:46:54.840</a></span> | <span class="t">It's gone to print. It's happening. That specifically talks about those retrievers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2821" target="_blank">00:47:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. Multiple labels, multiple indices, all the good things. So, let's do this. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2826" target="_blank">00:47:06.280</a></span> | <span class="t">for those of you who have... Let's go back to here. The other thing you're going to see on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2832" target="_blank">00:47:12.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the readme is you're going to see this Neo4j dump file. This is the actual dump file from our database,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2840" target="_blank">00:47:20.200</a></span> | <span class="t">from last year, I think. Then, so, we're going to give that to you. So, you can download that file,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2845" target="_blank">00:47:25.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and I'll show you how you can drop that into your...

And it's going to drop in our version of the Neo4j agent... Agent Neo</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2883" target="_blank">00:48:03.720</a></span> | <span class="t">GDS application data, I guess. Thanks. So, yeah. So, you just drag and drop it. It runs pretty quick.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2892" target="_blank">00:48:12.280</a></span> | <span class="t">It'll load pretty quick. And then what you'll see is when you go to query, you'll see this will start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2900" target="_blank">00:48:20.040</a></span> | <span class="t">to populate. The database information will populate. And it'll show you which nodes you have... Which nodes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2904" target="_blank">00:48:24.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and entities you have. It'll bring in some of the indices. There is... We did run some of the algorithms</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2912" target="_blank">00:48:32.040</a></span> | <span class="t">already. So, I'm going to show you how to run them so you can run them on your own. But in the interest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2917" target="_blank">00:48:37.880</a></span> | <span class="t">of time, we have run those already. So, you'll see some of that. Some of them will do live here. They</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2923" target="_blank">00:48:43.800</a></span> | <span class="t">won't be there.

So, on the readme, on the readme in the repository,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2934" target="_blank">00:48:54.520</a></span> | <span class="t">if you go all the way down to the bottom where it says connect to Neo4j or a DB, there's a Neo4j dump</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2939" target="_blank">00:48:59.720</a></span> | <span class="t">file that it will take you to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2945" target="_blank">00:49:05.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Sorry.

So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=2951" target="_blank">00:49:11.640</a></span> | <span class="t">when you're in...

I would take a peek at it.

So, again, the API key is there. We're not using it, actually, that much today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3191" target="_blank">00:53:11.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But one of the things that we have, obviously, is we need to have... Oh, God, you can't see anything,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3195" target="_blank">00:53:15.960</a></span> | <span class="t">this thing.

Well, that's overwhelming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3201" target="_blank">00:53:21.080</a></span> | <span class="t">That's more reasonable. Okay. Is that good? You guys can see? We're good? Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3205" target="_blank">00:53:25.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Um... Yeah. So, the basics. Obviously, we're importing OS. We're bringing in our environment variables.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3212" target="_blank">00:53:32.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Um... You see the Python driver. Right? This is our classic Python driver.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3217" target="_blank">00:53:37.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And then what I like to do is I like to just do a run query, um, uh, function just because it just makes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3224" target="_blank">00:53:44.920</a></span> | <span class="t">it easier. Like, I just like it. Um, you don't have to do it this way. You could just do driver.session,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3230" target="_blank">00:53:50.680</a></span> | <span class="t">but, um, that's just how I like to do it. And then when you run this, it'll see that, yes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3235" target="_blank">00:53:55.400</a></span> | <span class="t">you are actually connected. Oh, let's see. Maybe I should actually run everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3239" target="_blank">00:53:59.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Now we're connected. Okay. Um, the first thing that we're gonna do is we're just gonna take a look at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3248" target="_blank">00:54:08.600</a></span> | <span class="t">what is actually in the database. So, in this, um, APOC actually stands for awesome procedures on Cypher,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3256" target="_blank">00:54:16.920</a></span> | <span class="t">which I just think is hilarious. I think there's a double meeting on APOC too,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3260" target="_blank">00:54:20.760</a></span> | <span class="t">but we'll have to ask, um, isn't there another APOC meaning? Something? I don't know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3265" target="_blank">00:54:25.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Some, some matrixy thing. Um, but what this is gonna show you is we start out with 17,000 nodes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3274" target="_blank">00:54:34.440</a></span> | <span class="t">right? We have 774,000 relationships. Um, seven different labels and 27 different relationship types.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3284" target="_blank">00:54:44.440</a></span> | <span class="t">What does this tell us? What it tells us is obviously we got a lot of data. It's actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3288" target="_blank">00:54:48.360</a></span> | <span class="t">not that much really, um, you know, for something small. Um, but you know, like almost a million</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3293" target="_blank">00:54:53.960</a></span> | <span class="t">relationships. And so really what you, we're running this just to make sure that everything is loaded. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3300" target="_blank">00:55:00.120</a></span> | <span class="t">everybody who has loaded their data, are you seeing these numbers?

You're that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3373" target="_blank">00:56:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">helpful guy at work, aren't you? You're like, oh, I can just do this thing. It'll make it easy for everybody.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3377" target="_blank">00:56:17.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you, Caleb. Naya, also. Naya, round of applause. We love Naya. You'll probably see if you're from San</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3384" target="_blank">00:56:24.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Francisco, Naya is all places, as is Alexi. They're around all the time. So hopefully they're familiar</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3390" target="_blank">00:56:30.280</a></span> | <span class="t">faces for you all. Um, so yeah. So the first one is just really meant to get you to connect to the graph</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3397" target="_blank">00:56:37.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and make sure that your connection is working. Um, and just showing you how you can get some basic summary</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3402" target="_blank">00:56:42.440</a></span> | <span class="t">statistics. Um, you know, one of the things that we can do is we can preview some of these documents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3409" target="_blank">00:56:49.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so again, this is our data model just to get you familiar with what we're looking at.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3413" target="_blank">00:56:53.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And then let's move on to our notebook number two is where things get get more exciting. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3423" target="_blank">00:57:03.400</a></span> | <span class="t">in notebook number two, what we what we're looking to do is we're looking to actually start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3429" target="_blank">00:57:09.560</a></span> | <span class="t">leveraging these algorithms for, uh, where am I? Okay. So when we talk about graphs, like ultimately</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3438" target="_blank">00:57:18.760</a></span> | <span class="t">what we're trying to do is we're trying to help you do these things at scale. We're trying to help</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3441" target="_blank">00:57:21.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you be successful in production and we're trying to help you get the best possible outcome from the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3446" target="_blank">00:57:26.520</a></span> | <span class="t">applications that you're building. And the way that I, that I suggest is my little moniker, which is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3452" target="_blank">00:57:32.120</a></span> | <span class="t">connect cluster curate to your point of how do we actually manage this at scale? What does that look like?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3457" target="_blank">00:57:37.800</a></span> | <span class="t">What do we do? Um, what we have in these notebooks walks you through this very, this process. The way</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3463" target="_blank">00:57:43.480</a></span> | <span class="t">that it works is we start out by running KNN on similarity. So we take the embedding for each of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3468" target="_blank">00:57:48.520</a></span> | <span class="t">those documents and we create, uh, we leverage a similarity score. So, um, basically we take a K of 25,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3477" target="_blank">00:57:57.720</a></span> | <span class="t">we run KNN and we understand, we start making connections among very similar documents, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3484" target="_blank">00:58:04.360</a></span> | <span class="t">You'll see why we do that in a minute. But what this does is it sets us up for the next step, which is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3491" target="_blank">00:58:11.240</a></span> | <span class="t">community detection, also known as clustering. Um, and what it allows you to do is it allows you to group</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3498" target="_blank">00:58:18.040</a></span> | <span class="t">these like items so that you can manage them together, right? It's very hard to look at any one and know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3506" target="_blank">00:58:26.040</a></span> | <span class="t">what's happening, but we can certainly look at all of the things. And then finally what it leads us to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3511" target="_blank">00:58:31.320</a></span> | <span class="t">is we curate the grounding data set via these techniques that work at scale. So this is a similarity</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3517" target="_blank">00:58:37.240</a></span> | <span class="t">graph of context documents, um, you know, connected to their source URLs, right? So it makes sense that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3522" target="_blank">00:58:42.840</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a lot of overlap and similarity because they're coming from the same source. And you may be saying,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3527" target="_blank">00:58:47.720</a></span> | <span class="t">you may be saying, well, if they're all the same, like, why do I need to know that they're similar?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3531" target="_blank">00:58:51.640</a></span> | <span class="t">How does that help me? Well, it helps you in a few different ways. Uh, what the, oh, this thing's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3536" target="_blank">00:58:56.680</a></span> | <span class="t">going crazy. Um, what I first want to talk about is I want to talk, talk a little bit about the math</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3541" target="_blank">00:59:01.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and the understanding of how community detection works, right? Um, I promise you there's no calculus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3547" target="_blank">00:59:07.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and there's no quiz. Um, but when, so like, if we're looking at this doc, you know, we're looking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3554" target="_blank">00:59:14.120</a></span> | <span class="t">at a few different friends, a couple of friend groups, like it's pretty clear. Like there's one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3557" target="_blank">00:59:17.960</a></span> | <span class="t">click, there's another click. It's pretty obvious, right? Like that seems reasonable. And then when we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3563" target="_blank">00:59:23.960</a></span> | <span class="t">start getting bigger, like these are, these are similar. And what we're seeing here, this is actually,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3568" target="_blank">00:59:28.840</a></span> | <span class="t">these are actually sized by page rank, which is an important score. Um, and they're still like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3573" target="_blank">00:59:33.320</a></span> | <span class="t">it still seems pretty obvious. Like, yeah, they're clustering together. Like it's still pretty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3577" target="_blank">00:59:37.240</a></span> | <span class="t">logical. Like I get it. Um, but anybody who has worked with graph knows that it never looks like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3584" target="_blank">00:59:44.520</a></span> | <span class="t">this. Has anybody ever actually seen anything that looks as tidy? No, never. Cause it looks like this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3590" target="_blank">00:59:50.600</a></span> | <span class="t">right? This is what we're actually looking at, right? In this case, what we've got is we've got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3595" target="_blank">00:59:55.720</a></span> | <span class="t">all these different nodes. They're sized by page rank. And then the edges are weight. They're weighted edges,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3603" target="_blank">01:00:03.240</a></span> | <span class="t">right? It's very like the hairball people call it. Um, the bowl of spaghetti, whatever it is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3608" target="_blank">01:00:08.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And so like, it's very complex. So how do we actually find things that work? How do we actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3614" target="_blank">01:00:14.600</a></span> | <span class="t">run community? Oh my God, it's so sensitive. My goodness. Um, this is the boring math part,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3622" target="_blank">01:00:22.200</a></span> | <span class="t">but just so that you understand like what is happening under the hood. So when you're doing clustering in graph,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3628" target="_blank">01:00:28.280</a></span> | <span class="t">it's based on something called modularity optimization and a community is high modularity,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3634" target="_blank">01:00:34.760</a></span> | <span class="t">right? It's modular makes sense, right? When the items within or the connections within it are highly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3640" target="_blank">01:00:40.760</a></span> | <span class="t">interconnected with each other and have a very low connection to things outside, right? That's like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3646" target="_blank">01:00:46.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the basics of the math. So what it's going to do is the algorithm is going to go through and it's going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3651" target="_blank">01:00:51.880</a></span> | <span class="t">say, okay, for every node is the modularity score going to go up or is it going to go down if I put</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3657" target="_blank">01:00:57.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the same label as my neighbor, right? So does it belong with this group or does it belong with that group?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3662" target="_blank">01:01:02.120</a></span> | <span class="t">What does it do to the actual numbers, right? Louvain is a particular type of algorithm and this is where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3669" target="_blank">01:01:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">it says, yeah, that's exactly what we just talked about. So how does it actually work? So what it will do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3675" target="_blank">01:01:15.240</a></span> | <span class="t">is it will start by giving a single node a label and then it does the calculation and says, okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3680" target="_blank">01:01:20.520</a></span> | <span class="t">like let me figure out, does it go up or does it go down? And then it will do the first pass and it'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3685" target="_blank">01:01:25.800</a></span> | <span class="t">say, okay, these are the ones that are most connected to each other. And then it'll say, okay, well, let me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3691" target="_blank">01:01:31.880</a></span> | <span class="t">group and aggregate those and let me look at how many, what you see in step two is you see the number of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3698" target="_blank">01:01:38.840</a></span> | <span class="t">connections between each of those clusters, right? So when we look at it, so, you know, it's pretty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3704" target="_blank">01:01:44.680</a></span> | <span class="t">straightforward. The pinks and the yellows, there's three edges between them, but there's 14 within</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3710" target="_blank">01:01:50.440</a></span> | <span class="t">just pink and there's two within yellow and four within green and 14 within blue, right? So what it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3715" target="_blank">01:01:55.960</a></span> | <span class="t">shows you is it's showing you that like there's a lot connected within and not so many on the outside,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3721" target="_blank">01:02:01.160</a></span> | <span class="t">right? Pretty straightforward. That's pretty easy math, right? And then it just keeps going through and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3727" target="_blank">01:02:07.960</a></span> | <span class="t">eventually it goes down. One of the things to know, um, there's another algorithm called Leiden.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3732" target="_blank">01:02:12.840</a></span> | <span class="t">It is similar, but it, um, but if you need to work with unconnected graphs, so depending on whether your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3738" target="_blank">01:02:18.760</a></span> | <span class="t">graph is completely connected or not, there are different ones. But ultimately what it's doing is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3743" target="_blank">01:02:23.080</a></span> | <span class="t">saying, you know, are, are these things, which of these things is not like the other, right? So label</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3749" target="_blank">01:02:29.160</a></span> | <span class="t">propagation is, uh, is another way of doing clustering. And what label propagation does is it says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3755" target="_blank">01:02:35.160</a></span> | <span class="t">okay, I'm going to assign a random label to something or I, I know these labels and then I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3761" target="_blank">01:02:41.400</a></span> | <span class="t">going to go to the neighbors and I'm going to say, I'm going to assign what this one is to its neighbors</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3766" target="_blank">01:02:46.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and then eventually we have these iterations where they converge label propagation algorithm. Now the nice</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3771" target="_blank">01:02:51.960</a></span> | <span class="t">thing about the label propagation algorithm is it's actually one of the fastest clustering algorithms. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3777" target="_blank">01:02:57.240</a></span> | <span class="t">especially if you've got lots and lots of values and you want to run something very big, it's a very fast way to do it. Um, if you need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3784" target="_blank">01:03:04.680</a></span> | <span class="t">something that's like highly nuanced, it's worth spending the time and the computation to use one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3789" target="_blank">01:03:09.880</a></span> | <span class="t">of the other algorithms. But what I wanted to do is I just wanted to, to show you what this looks like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3795" target="_blank">01:03:15.080</a></span> | <span class="t">because label propagation, it's, and modularity does the same thing. It's really looking for density.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3801" target="_blank">01:03:21.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It's looking for density in those graphs. So when we think about, you know, the craziness that we see here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3807" target="_blank">01:03:27.880</a></span> | <span class="t">like even in this, like you can see like little pockets of density, right? We see these pockets of density.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3812" target="_blank">01:03:32.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I always like to take the soft eye when we look at graphs. Um, and so that's what, that's what's happening</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3818" target="_blank">01:03:38.440</a></span> | <span class="t">with the math under the hood, right? So what does this actually mean in our, in our code? So what we've got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3827" target="_blank">01:03:47.960</a></span> | <span class="t">is, let me close this out. So what we're going to do is the first thing you do is you're going to run the KNN.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3835" target="_blank">01:03:55.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So you run the KNN on similarity. Obviously we connect as always. Um, there is a weird little thing you have to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3841" target="_blank">01:04:01.960</a></span> | <span class="t">You have to create an empty relationship, but don't worry about that. Like I gave it to you. Um, but that's a little,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3848" target="_blank">01:04:08.120</a></span> | <span class="t">little peat point. Um, that's probably cause we don't need it. Um, but then we run the query and I just want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3853" target="_blank">01:04:13.800</a></span> | <span class="t">to walk through how the query is actually built and what it looks like. So the first thing that we have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3859" target="_blank">01:04:19.560</a></span> | <span class="t">is, do I have my, I want to, I want to see this. Sorry. Somebody's got a question over here. Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3865" target="_blank">01:04:25.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Then, then, then over there, Caleb. There we go. Here we go. Did you have a question?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3872" target="_blank">01:04:32.760</a></span> | <span class="t">- Yes. - Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3879" target="_blank">01:04:39.160</a></span> | <span class="t">- Mmm. Graph.project. So just to go over like one, what, what the process is when you're,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3888" target="_blank">01:04:48.600</a></span> | <span class="t">when you're actually, um, running the algorithms. The first thing you need to do is you need to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3893" target="_blank">01:04:53.480</a></span> | <span class="t">project a graph because most of the time when you're running the algorithm, you're not running</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3897" target="_blank">01:04:57.960</a></span> | <span class="t">it on the entire graph, right? We're running it on something small. So in our case, we want to run</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3902" target="_blank">01:05:02.440</a></span> | <span class="t">k-nearest neighbors just on the documents, right? So what we need to do is we create this, uh, this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3909" target="_blank">01:05:09.320</a></span> | <span class="t">projection. So here we've got, we're calling the projection. We're calling it docs. So the first thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3915" target="_blank">01:05:15.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you'll see is the name of the projection, which is docs. What, then what we look at is we look at which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3920" target="_blank">01:05:20.520</a></span> | <span class="t">nodes. The next thing you're going to see is nodes. So for us, we're using documents, right? So we want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3924" target="_blank">01:05:24.760</a></span> | <span class="t">documents. I want to include the property embedding. So you really want to make sure you're only bringing in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3930" target="_blank">01:05:30.280</a></span> | <span class="t">what you need, right? Because it's just going to make things run faster. Um, and then because it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3935" target="_blank">01:05:35.240</a></span> | <span class="t">just, the documents aren't related to each other yet, right? We know that from the data model those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3939" target="_blank">01:05:39.720</a></span> | <span class="t">documents are related to the responses, but they're not related to each other. We're building this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3944" target="_blank">01:05:44.200</a></span> | <span class="t">similarity among them. And so it happens to be an empty relationship. And then what it will do is it will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3950" target="_blank">01:05:50.520</a></span> | <span class="t">give us the graph name, the node count, and it'll, and it'll let us know that it ran. And what that ends up looking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3956" target="_blank">01:05:56.120</a></span> | <span class="t">like is, let me go to my aura. Where's my aura? I'm so not aura, as the middle school would say right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3964" target="_blank">01:06:04.760</a></span> | <span class="t">now. Okay. Um, so let's go into explore. Anybody here have middle schoolers or like, no, the whole like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3971" target="_blank">01:06:11.640</a></span> | <span class="t">brain rot, like riz, aura, skibbity, like it's insanity. All right. Um, so what we're going to be looking at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3979" target="_blank">01:06:19.560</a></span> | <span class="t">is when we look at documents, I've run it already. Um, so we're going to see that there's similarity</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3987" target="_blank">01:06:27.160</a></span> | <span class="t">among them, but right now we're going to see these documents and what I want to look at is, oh yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=3993" target="_blank">01:06:33.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm going to look at documents that are connected to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4003" target="_blank">01:06:43.480</a></span> | <span class="t">come on. Similar to documents. Oh, actually let me, yeah, that'll work. It takes a second to run. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4019" target="_blank">01:06:59.320</a></span> | <span class="t">one of the, one of the things that, um, I did is I actually changed what the way that we look at it in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4025" target="_blank">01:07:05.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the graph, just so you know, I changed it so that it's actually the colors of the nodes are by community.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4031" target="_blank">01:07:11.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Because what I wanted to see is I wanted to see like, do we start to see, let me run this one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4036" target="_blank">01:07:16.920</a></span> | <span class="t">more time. Let me clear the scene. Do this. Oh, dear sweet Wi-Fi. Maybe I should open up my Neo4j,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4050" target="_blank">01:07:30.280</a></span> | <span class="t">like desktop. Um, yeah. So what we're going to see is we're going to see the connections in and among</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4057" target="_blank">01:07:37.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the, hold on a second. I don't like this. I don't like this at all. What it's eventually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4065" target="_blank">01:07:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">going to show you is it's going to show you the similarities in and among, and it's going to be like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4068" target="_blank">01:07:48.680</a></span> | <span class="t">the greatest ever hairball. So in this particular case, like this is what it might look like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4076" target="_blank">01:07:56.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and what we see is like we saw with the big one, like you're going to see like clusters of documents</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4082" target="_blank">01:08:02.120</a></span> | <span class="t">that are very similar. The other thing that we're going to see is we're going to see what I call the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4087" target="_blank">01:08:07.720</a></span> | <span class="t">bridge documents. The ones that will often be the, the middleman. We call it, um, betweenness centrality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4095" target="_blank">01:08:15.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what you want to understand, like I said, it's the soft eye. You want to understand what is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4101" target="_blank">01:08:21.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the clustering of your documents. And again, you might be asking yourself like, why is that helpful?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4105" target="_blank">01:08:25.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And I promise you the reason that it's helpful is because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4109" target="_blank">01:08:29.720</a></span> | <span class="t">what we end up being able to do is understand what's happening within the data. So this is a 2d version of,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4119" target="_blank">01:08:39.160</a></span> | <span class="t">of these embeddings and these clusters. And what we see is we see, you know, it looks like a bowl of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4125" target="_blank">01:08:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">fruit loops. Like how, again, Alison, how is this helpful? I'm not a data scientist. Like what is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4129" target="_blank">01:08:49.880</a></span> | <span class="t">happening here? Um, but when we zoom in, we see a couple of things. In one case, we have a single</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4135" target="_blank">01:08:55.080</a></span> | <span class="t">community document cluster. So what we're seeing is there's a lot of similarity in the embedding,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4139" target="_blank">01:08:59.720</a></span> | <span class="t">right? They're all in that same community. They're all very similar. And then in this other side,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4144" target="_blank">01:09:04.760</a></span> | <span class="t">we've got some, they're kind of spread out, like nothing really clear on a perimeter, right? Like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4149" target="_blank">01:09:09.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you're like, is that good clustering or not? Um, and so my question to you is, which is better?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4154" target="_blank">01:09:14.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Which of these do you think might say, oh yeah, like we've got it. We've got what we need. We're good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4161" target="_blank">01:09:21.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Pros and cons. Somebody says some. Single community. What's the, what's the thought on a single</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4169" target="_blank">01:09:29.800</a></span> | <span class="t">community? Figure out there is some relationship between those nodes. Yeah, they're very similar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4176" target="_blank">01:09:36.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Mm-hmm. That's awesome. And in traditional clustering, that would be great, right? If we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4181" target="_blank">01:09:41.480</a></span> | <span class="t">talking about clustering customers, we're doing customer 360, we're like, oh, this is a group,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4185" target="_blank">01:09:45.160</a></span> | <span class="t">this is a thing. But one of the things that we have, though, is that means we have a lot of very similar</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4190" target="_blank">01:09:50.680</a></span> | <span class="t">documents. So the question is, do we really want it to look like that? Customers, yes. Documents, no.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4197" target="_blank">01:09:57.480</a></span> | <span class="t">No. Right? Because one of the things that we need to understand is we need to really be efficient.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4203" target="_blank">01:10:03.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So when we talk about what is a high quality grounding data set in your retrieval augmented</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4207" target="_blank">01:10:07.960</a></span> | <span class="t">generation, these are our five basic principles that we, that we go by. Is it relevant? Is it actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4214" target="_blank">01:10:14.680</a></span> | <span class="t">giving an augmenting answer? Is it reliable? Right? Like, do you have, do you have like a lot of variety</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4221" target="_blank">01:10:21.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that's coming back on something? Like, is it really disparate from these communities? Because there's a hole in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4226" target="_blank">01:10:26.120</a></span> | <span class="t">your data. Because we don't know. Right? There's a gap in all this high dimensional space. There's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4230" target="_blank">01:10:30.920</a></span> | <span class="t">this like big blind spot that you don't know about. And again, is it efficient? How many people here are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4236" target="_blank">01:10:36.760</a></span> | <span class="t">really worried about their applications being efficient? Everybody. I know, right? It makes you crazy. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4242" target="_blank">01:10:42.840</a></span> | <span class="t">again, how do we do this at scale? What does that look like? So once we've done this clustering and we've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4248" target="_blank">01:10:48.840</a></span> | <span class="t">assigned these communities to these nodes, then we can start looking at the data itself. Right? In this particular</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4254" target="_blank">01:10:54.760</a></span> | <span class="t">instance, one of the first things we did, and you'll, you'll see it, I left all the, the dump that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4258" target="_blank">01:10:58.920</a></span> | <span class="t">have has all the errors in it. So you can play with them. We can see that the median average word length</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4264" target="_blank">01:11:04.360</a></span> | <span class="t">is 512 characters. Well, our chunks are a length of 512. So that's probably not good data for us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4271" target="_blank">01:11:11.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? That's not helpful. And it's clearly very different from everybody else. So what does that look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4276" target="_blank">01:11:16.920</a></span> | <span class="t">like? Median word count 1. So all of these are summary statistics at the, at that cluster level,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4282" target="_blank">01:11:22.120</a></span> | <span class="t">at that community level. And so when we looked into it, we found this is very, you know, like, again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4289" target="_blank">01:11:29.080</a></span> | <span class="t">we brought our data in from, you know, web pages and all these different places. So clearly this is not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4294" target="_blank">01:11:34.520</a></span> | <span class="t">going to be helpful to an answer. Right? At least not to a human. Right? So this is a way that we can start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4300" target="_blank">01:11:40.520</a></span> | <span class="t">to clean something out. The basics. Right? Like, just the basics. The other thing that's going to come</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4307" target="_blank">01:11:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">up in that high density, like that high similarity we saw is this. Highly similar text chunks. In this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4313" target="_blank">01:11:53.160</a></span> | <span class="t">particular one here, community 4702, our average similarity is 0.98. We have 49 documents. 49 chunks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4321" target="_blank">01:12:01.480</a></span> | <span class="t">that are almost completely identical. If you're doing a retriever that gives, you know, the top 10, that's not going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4328" target="_blank">01:12:08.440</a></span> | <span class="t">give you any context at all. It's just going to be really confident about this one thing. Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4334" target="_blank">01:12:14.120</a></span> | <span class="t">How do you know that it's even the right thing? Right? So one of the things that you want to start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4338" target="_blank">01:12:18.280</a></span> | <span class="t">looking at is ways that you can sometimes increase the diversity. Right? Like, I have a talk that I've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4346" target="_blank">01:12:26.840</a></span> | <span class="t">submitted many, many times that has never been accepted. And it's called "The Dark Side of Distance</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4352" target="_blank">01:12:32.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Metrics: How Cosine Similarity Broke America." Right? I don't know why it doesn't get accepted. Why is that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4358" target="_blank">01:12:38.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? Because cosine similarity gives you exactly what you want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4363" target="_blank">01:12:43.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Gives you exactly what you want. Right? Like, I call it the chicken nuggets and Twinkies. If I had a robot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4369" target="_blank">01:12:49.480</a></span> | <span class="t">in my house and I went to San Francisco and it was responsible for cooking for my kids, when I came back,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4374" target="_blank">01:12:54.440</a></span> | <span class="t">all I'd be making is chicken nuggets and Twinkies. Right? That's the same thing that's happening in our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4379" target="_blank">01:12:59.480</a></span> | <span class="t">algorithms. And so where this becomes really, really important, where everybody here is working with agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4389" target="_blank">01:13:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you are refining signal at every turn. So if you get a signal, it's going to pick up on it and it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4397" target="_blank">01:13:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">going to run with it. And it's going to go down to the next agent and the next agent and the next agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4401" target="_blank">01:13:21.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And whatever that, whatever that path that it got on, it's going to go. Right? Because that's what we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4407" target="_blank">01:13:27.160</a></span> | <span class="t">programmed it to do. It's doing its job. It's doing exactly what we told it to do. But is that what we want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4412" target="_blank">01:13:32.440</a></span> | <span class="t">it to do? So one of the ways that, like, this community approach to documentation is really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4418" target="_blank">01:13:38.440</a></span> | <span class="t">interesting is you can look at what are the variety of documents. You can actually use re-ranking for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4426" target="_blank">01:13:46.360</a></span> | <span class="t">diversity in your responses. So let's say we do a vector retriever, right? We take the vector retriever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4432" target="_blank">01:13:52.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and it comes back with this scoring. These things are all really similar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4435" target="_blank">01:13:55.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay? Well, most of them are from this community. But then the ones a little further down are from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4441" target="_blank">01:14:01.640</a></span> | <span class="t">another community. So you can actually do different ways of re-ranking. So you can wait for diversity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4449" target="_blank">01:14:09.880</a></span> | <span class="t">You can wait for page rank, right? Like one of the examples we have in here is using page rank.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4455" target="_blank">01:14:15.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Of these vectors, which ones are the most important? Which are the ones that people go to the most?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4460" target="_blank">01:14:20.520</a></span> | <span class="t">We want to be feeding that back, right? It's like, it's why Google made billions of dollars, right? Page rank.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4466" target="_blank">01:14:26.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Change the way everybody searched. So what I want you to be thinking about is you need to be thinking about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4473" target="_blank">01:14:33.480</a></span> | <span class="t">what I call intelligent outcome management. It's not just about like, you know, AI, artificial intelligence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4479" target="_blank">01:14:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But what are the outcomes that we're getting? And how do we give really good ones?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4484" target="_blank">01:14:44.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm here to show you how you can use these algorithms to help you like diversify that a little bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4490" target="_blank">01:14:50.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So when we looked at these highly similar text chunks,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4494" target="_blank">01:14:54.440</a></span> | <span class="t">they're highly similar. It's because it comes from our documentation, right? We've got multiple versions, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4501" target="_blank">01:15:01.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Like we've got a version for 1.5 and a version for 1.6. Well, the algorithm doesn't change, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4506" target="_blank">01:15:06.200</a></span> | <span class="t">The algorithm doesn't change. So that's why we have all these repeats.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4508" target="_blank">01:15:08.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So the other great thing about graphs, because, you know, every chance I get to love on a graph, I will,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4513" target="_blank">01:15:13.880</a></span> | <span class="t">is you actually can very easily in this one moment, APOC nodes collapse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4520" target="_blank">01:15:20.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Awesome procedures on Cypher. So what it's going to do is it's going to do two things. One is going to make your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4527" target="_blank">01:15:27.240</a></span> | <span class="t">retrieval much more efficient because you now have one version of it instead of many.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4531" target="_blank">01:15:31.560</a></span> | <span class="t">But what it's also going to do is it's going to maintain the lineage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4535" target="_blank">01:15:35.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It's going to maintain the connection. So now we've got a single document, but we can see all of those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4542" target="_blank">01:15:42.200</a></span> | <span class="t">sources. We can see where it came from. So you don't lose the institutional understanding, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4549" target="_blank">01:15:49.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Nobody likes-- and who likes dropping rows? Everybody gets worried when you drop a row,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4552" target="_blank">01:15:52.920</a></span> | <span class="t">right? Like, maybe it's just me. I always get worried. I'm like, oh, I'm dropping rows.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4556" target="_blank">01:15:56.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Is this what I want? So in this case, you don't have to. And that's what's so great about and flexible</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4561" target="_blank">01:16:01.240</a></span> | <span class="t">about the graph is that you can do these large-scale management moments, and you're-- you get more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4567" target="_blank">01:16:07.560</a></span> | <span class="t">efficient. You get really clear. You don't-- or you're not over-bundling something or overpowering</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4572" target="_blank">01:16:12.760</a></span> | <span class="t">something. Question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4573" target="_blank">01:16:13.480</a></span> | <span class="t">What does it mean to collapse here?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4575" target="_blank">01:16:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, so basically what we're doing here is we're saying these four are all the-- basically all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4579" target="_blank">01:16:19.160</a></span> | <span class="t">same. The text and the embedding are the same. So we're going to collapse them into a single node,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4583" target="_blank">01:16:23.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and we're going to maintain the original relationships. So in this case, when-- then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4587" target="_blank">01:16:27.960</a></span> | <span class="t">when you hit that embedding, you're only hitting it once instead of 19 or 49 times in our case. Yes?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4592" target="_blank">01:16:32.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So on the document that are pretty much very similar, if they have various properties,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4598" target="_blank">01:16:38.360</a></span> | <span class="t">they're slightly different. When you do the collapse, does it join all the properties together?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4601" target="_blank">01:16:41.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It depends on how you want to do it. Like, you certainly could. I mean, it may be that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4606" target="_blank">01:16:46.680</a></span> | <span class="t">don't-- you may only want to, like, adjust what's in the index, right? Like, it could be a different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4611" target="_blank">01:16:51.400</a></span> | <span class="t">way that you want to manage it, like, depending on what you need to maintain, right? If it's legal,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4615" target="_blank">01:16:55.640</a></span> | <span class="t">then you probably don't want to lose anything. Um, you know, there's-- there's options. Yeah?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4623" target="_blank">01:17:03.160</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a microphone for you. Because it's a good question. Everybody needs to hear it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4632" target="_blank">01:17:12.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So, um, the documents will be exactly the same for each one of the URL pages. The chunking was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4640" target="_blank">01:17:20.840</a></span> | <span class="t">similar and the similar kind of things got picked up. So does chunking impact when-- in these kinds of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4648" target="_blank">01:17:28.360</a></span> | <span class="t">mechanisms, how the similarity works? Yeah, I mean, because it could be, right? Because if it's the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4652" target="_blank">01:17:32.440</a></span> | <span class="t">same page, but one has, like, an extra paragraph for that version, then the chunking might split</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4656" target="_blank">01:17:36.440</a></span> | <span class="t">differently, right? So you're not gonna-- it's not gonna-- it's not like a magic wand, right? It's no magic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4661" target="_blank">01:17:41.720</a></span> | <span class="t">eraser. But it's definitely an easy way to increase your efficiency and increase the quality of the output in the data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4668" target="_blank">01:17:48.600</a></span> | <span class="t">itself. Yes? So, you did the clustering on documents, or did you do the clustering on all different kinds of nodes that you have?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4677" target="_blank">01:17:57.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I did the clustering just on the document nodes, which in this case are actually chunks, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4683" target="_blank">01:18:03.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's just on those. So it takes the embedding, right, for that chunk, and then we run that KNN</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4689" target="_blank">01:18:09.080</a></span> | <span class="t">so that we understand, like, do we have these really high-density places? The other thing it allows you to do is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4695" target="_blank">01:18:15.480</a></span> | <span class="t">understand, like, do I have the right information, right? So, um, where are we?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4701" target="_blank">01:18:21.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Right, so again, like, what are the most frequently used communities? We've seen this already, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4708" target="_blank">01:18:28.760</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a conversation, you know, these are the original documents. This is the the next set, some of it, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4714" target="_blank">01:18:34.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, I've been doing more research into understanding, like, how people travel around the communities in different conversations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4724" target="_blank">01:18:44.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Do they all end in one place, or do they start in one place? Or how long does it take someone to get to the right area?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4730" target="_blank">01:18:50.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? I mean, it's, you know, we're basically tracking human cognition by watching the way people move around their thought process, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4739" target="_blank">01:18:59.160</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, this is, like, one particular visualization of a single conversation, and for each of these,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4747" target="_blank">01:19:07.640</a></span> | <span class="t">we've got, you know, 10 pieces, 10 context documents that come back.

Is it the person that's connected to any, everybody?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4843" target="_blank">01:20:43.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Or is it, you know, the one person that talks to both sides of the, of the business? Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4849" target="_blank">01:20:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Betweenness centrality says it's this person. Page rank says it's somebody else. So that's the other thing, too,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4854" target="_blank">01:20:54.840</a></span> | <span class="t">is when we're trying to figure out what's important, we have a variety of algorithms that do different things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4859" target="_blank">01:20:59.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that make that available to you. You know, conversation lengths, right? I mean, this is just some of the basics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4865" target="_blank">01:21:05.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, but this is just another really interesting one is we are looking at, um, good ratings and bad, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4871" target="_blank">01:21:11.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is just an analysis based on the community, right? How many are in the community? Um, and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4882" target="_blank">01:21:22.520</a></span> | <span class="t">are the ratings good or bad by community, right? If you find that there's a, that there's a cluster</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4887" target="_blank">01:21:27.800</a></span> | <span class="t">of documents where the ratings are significantly worse than the others, let me go look at that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4894" target="_blank">01:21:34.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Let me go look at those documents. Maybe it's, you know, outdated. I had somebody, this is my interesting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4901" target="_blank">01:21:41.160</a></span> | <span class="t">story. So, um, I do some work with some folks who do like DOD and Fed work and, um, former Navy SEAL,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4909" target="_blank">01:21:49.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and he's just like, yeah, I couldn't believe it. And I'm like, what? He's like, somebody was doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4913" target="_blank">01:21:53.400</a></span> | <span class="t">this proposal and they have like this one thing that they have to put in, like some risk assessment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4918" target="_blank">01:21:58.360</a></span> | <span class="t">thing. And like, it's just like they copy and paste it over and over and over again. And so one day he got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4923" target="_blank">01:22:03.720</a></span> | <span class="t">really curious and he wanted to actually track where it came from. It was almost word for word something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4929" target="_blank">01:22:09.480</a></span> | <span class="t">from the Vietnam War that people are still putting into these documents, right? Like it's got, like if we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4937" target="_blank">01:22:17.160</a></span> | <span class="t">just threw it into a RAG application, it would have really high page rank. Everybody's using it. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4942" target="_blank">01:22:22.440</a></span> | <span class="t">where did it come from? Is that what we want? So looking at the things that are influential,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4946" target="_blank">01:22:26.680</a></span> | <span class="t">not because they're an anomaly, but because we're amplifying that signal, is that the signal we want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4953" target="_blank">01:22:33.400</a></span> | <span class="t">to amplify? That's a whole other like AI observability thing. But the reason I bring it up is that our job is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4960" target="_blank">01:22:40.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to build good, smart applications. We are responsible for the outcomes of these processes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4966" target="_blank">01:22:46.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And these are some ways that you can take a new approach to what you're doing, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4971" target="_blank">01:22:51.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Let me go back. Questions? Comments? Concerns? Yes?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4977" target="_blank">01:22:57.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. I don't know that there's-- I mean, you have to do the projection and run the algorithm.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=4994" target="_blank">01:23:14.280</a></span> | <span class="t">But we've got it in here, community detection and assignment. I believe betweenness is in here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5001" target="_blank">01:23:21.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, betweenness might be in number three.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5003" target="_blank">01:23:23.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Creating secondary relation to that. We're not even going to get to that. Yeah. So there's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5009" target="_blank">01:23:29.800</a></span> | <span class="t">betweenness centrality. So when you look at the algorithms, they're all going to be pretty much the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5015" target="_blank">01:23:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">same. It's going to be GDS and then the name of the algorithm. And then there's a couple of different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5019" target="_blank">01:23:39.640</a></span> | <span class="t">options. Stream means run the calculations and let me look at them. Just put them here. Mutate will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5026" target="_blank">01:23:46.360</a></span> | <span class="t">actually change the projection. You can also write. So if you do the algorithm dot write, it's going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5033" target="_blank">01:23:53.720</a></span> | <span class="t">write back to the node and we'll write that assignment back. So sometimes you just want to play. You just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5037" target="_blank">01:23:57.960</a></span> | <span class="t">want to look at it, right? Sometimes you may want to just change it within the production and just play</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5042" target="_blank">01:24:02.360</a></span> | <span class="t">around. So you've got a few different ways that you can apply the algorithm once those numbers come out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5047" target="_blank">01:24:07.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And the basic is you're always going to do a call. You're going to call the algorithm.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5051" target="_blank">01:24:11.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the first thing you're going to do is say, which projection am I running this on?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5054" target="_blank">01:24:14.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? In this projection, I actually had, like, I created a new relationship called co-occurrence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5068" target="_blank">01:24:28.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Where is it? Yeah. So what this did is it says, okay, I'm going to look at the message and I want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5076" target="_blank">01:24:36.040</a></span> | <span class="t">see the different documents that are in the same message. And for each of those where the elements aren't the same,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5083" target="_blank">01:24:43.160</a></span> | <span class="t">right? So I don't want to create a connection to itself. I want to merge. Merge is, you can either</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5088" target="_blank">01:24:48.920</a></span> | <span class="t">create or merge a relationship. Merge just means if it doesn't exist, make it. I'm going to merge the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5097" target="_blank">01:24:57.720</a></span> | <span class="t">chunk one or the context one with context two. And I'm going to create this new relationship co-occurs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5103" target="_blank">01:25:03.800</a></span> | <span class="t">with. And the reason I wanted to do this is I wanted to see, like, which things come up together a lot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5109" target="_blank">01:25:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Because sometimes it's not just about the similarity. If I've done a really good job of curating my data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5114" target="_blank">01:25:14.920</a></span> | <span class="t">set, and I don't have a lot of that redundancy, I want to see, like, what are the concepts that are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5120" target="_blank">01:25:20.680</a></span> | <span class="t">coming together? Like, what are the things that come together? From there, you can then look at the way</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5125" target="_blank">01:25:25.480</a></span> | <span class="t">they travel around each piece from one to another. So what I did is I created this co-occurrence,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5130" target="_blank">01:25:30.840</a></span> | <span class="t">right? So yes. So like, if we went back to our-- so basically, co-occurrence just says all of these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5139" target="_blank">01:25:39.640</a></span> | <span class="t">documents that were pulled in by this question will now have a relationship among them, right? And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5146" target="_blank">01:25:46.760</a></span> | <span class="t">we weight that by how often do they come up together, right? You can do the same thing with traversal. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5153" target="_blank">01:25:53.080</a></span> | <span class="t">these chunks come first, these chunks come second. So if you know that the conversations usually go in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5160" target="_blank">01:26:00.520</a></span> | <span class="t">that direction, do you want to figure-- what's the probability? Can I predict the next thing? Can I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5165" target="_blank">01:26:05.720</a></span> | <span class="t">figure out where the conversation is going to go? So all of this to say that, you know, I love that there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5171" target="_blank">01:26:11.960</a></span> | <span class="t">a graph where I track. I love that it's just sort of like the way many people are doing things. And what I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5177" target="_blank">01:26:17.480</a></span> | <span class="t">want you to know is you've done all the hard work of building the graph. Now let's use it even more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5183" target="_blank">01:26:23.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's get even more out of it. There was a question somewhere. Yeah, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5187" target="_blank">01:26:27.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Co-occurrence is when, like, the-- you ask a question and then the retrieved answer, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5194" target="_blank">01:26:34.440</a></span> | <span class="t">you have, like, two answers that are commonly retrieved together, like, to that question. Is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5198" target="_blank">01:26:38.680</a></span> | <span class="t">co-occurrence? Am I understanding it correctly? The co-occurrence is all-- everything that came</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5205" target="_blank">01:26:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">into this one, like, if you're doing a K of 10, all of those 10 will co-occur, meaning, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5211" target="_blank">01:26:51.400</a></span> | <span class="t">they all were answered together. They all were fed back at the same time, right? So it's almost like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5218" target="_blank">01:26:58.040</a></span> | <span class="t">an affinity of, like, these things often come together. Then you can, like I said, you can do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5222" target="_blank">01:27:02.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the same thing. You can expand it out into, like, follow-on. Like, these things usually follow those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5227" target="_blank">01:27:07.560</a></span> | <span class="t">things, right? So we can start to see. And that's where, you know, things get juicy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5232" target="_blank">01:27:12.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you. My nerdy, like, data science brain gets super excited. Like, oh my god. Then we can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5237" target="_blank">01:27:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">check this. Then we can check that. And maybe somebody cares. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5241" target="_blank">01:27:21.080</a></span> | <span class="t">You said what?

I'll be back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5244" target="_blank">01:27:24.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I got a question more-- more not a technical question, more general. So you mentioned the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5250" target="_blank">01:27:30.600</a></span> | <span class="t">DOD and FED space. So we operate in the DOD space. Oh, nice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5254" target="_blank">01:27:34.520</a></span> | <span class="t">More on the industry side. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5256" target="_blank">01:27:36.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So what is the, you know, what are your thoughts on the adoption of this technology,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5261" target="_blank">01:27:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">so within the DOD, both on the government side and also on the U.S. side?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5266" target="_blank">01:27:46.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.

You know, and so, like, I think the best thing that we can all do is to just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5323" target="_blank">01:28:43.800</a></span> | <span class="t">keep those things in mind. And so that's where the conversations, like, my conversations with them,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5329" target="_blank">01:28:49.320</a></span> | <span class="t">like, and I'm not, like, saying, like, oh, you're so dumb. Like, you don't know. Like, people don't know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5334" target="_blank">01:28:54.200</a></span> | <span class="t">right? Like, like, I've been doing this for years. Like, I've lived in the calculus, right? Like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5339" target="_blank">01:28:59.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I've lived in, like, you know, understanding the mathematics of the neural network, right? Like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5345" target="_blank">01:29:05.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I've spent a lot of time-- like, the data scientists, we had rigor and we had mathematics and we, like, had--</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5349" target="_blank">01:29:09.880</a></span> | <span class="t">every time we released a model, we had model reports and all this stuff. And now it's just like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5356" target="_blank">01:29:16.120</a></span> | <span class="t">just trust it. It's good. We're fine, right? And a lot of it is, right? Like, we do-- I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5363" target="_blank">01:29:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">it's the world we live in.

I love</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5368" target="_blank">01:29:28.360</a></span> | <span class="t">what's possible. But I just think that we just need to be a little bit thoughtful about what we're doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5373" target="_blank">01:29:33.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And, like, that's why these are easy things to do, right? Like, and then once you're aware of it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5379" target="_blank">01:29:39.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you're like, oh, yeah, I'm going to get a much better answer. That's awesome. Let's do that. Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5383" target="_blank">01:29:43.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I have a question. So on the-- more on the knowledge graph side of things, is there, like, an easier way to--</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5393" target="_blank">01:29:53.080</a></span> | <span class="t">is there an easier way to automatically create the knowledge graph? Because, you know, things like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5399" target="_blank">01:29:59.160</a></span> | <span class="t">graphlets have really made things a lot easier for a lot of people versus, like, this is-- to me,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5407" target="_blank">01:30:07.720</a></span> | <span class="t">it's kind of like an old school way of creating graph, which is you've really got to be the domain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5412" target="_blank">01:30:12.360</a></span> | <span class="t">expert and know all the ontologies and all the relationships. But what if you wanted to do that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5417" target="_blank">01:30:17.320</a></span> | <span class="t">automatically many times over for different types of businesses? How do you do that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5421" target="_blank">01:30:21.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. It's a really excellent question. And so hopefully everybody heard the question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5425" target="_blank">01:30:25.240</a></span> | <span class="t">is, like, how do you, like, build graphs at scale, right? Like, how do you do it without having to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5430" target="_blank">01:30:30.040</a></span> | <span class="t">an expert? The knowledge graph builder, the KG builder that Neo4j built-- because these are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5436" target="_blank">01:30:36.120</a></span> | <span class="t">questions that people have, right? There's some really interesting ways. Like, you can actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5441" target="_blank">01:30:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">use the simple KG pipeline and just throw your documents in and just say, "Tell me what's important."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5445" target="_blank">01:30:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? It's going to go through and do basic named entity recognition. Based on those entities,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5451" target="_blank">01:30:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it'll do another pass and say, "How are they related?" And what it'll do is it'll look at each</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5455" target="_blank">01:30:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">document individually. But then what you start to see is you start to see, like, the natural organic,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5459" target="_blank">01:30:59.960</a></span> | <span class="t">like, what's actually in there, what comes up. So I love that for experimentation and for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5465" target="_blank">01:31:05.800</a></span> | <span class="t">understanding. Because oftentimes, as builders, we don't know. We're not the subject matter experts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5470" target="_blank">01:31:10.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But we're responsible for building the architecture for them to get the right answer, right? So how--</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5474" target="_blank">01:31:14.840</a></span> | <span class="t">what tools do we have to try and service it? Because then you can run it and it'll be noisy. Like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5480" target="_blank">01:31:20.680</a></span> | <span class="t">it will look like spaghetti. It will be noisy. But then you can say, "Okay, tell me how many of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5484" target="_blank">01:31:24.920</a></span> | <span class="t">this label. How many of that label? Show me, like, what is the page rank? What is the betweenness</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5491" target="_blank">01:31:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">centrality?" Right? You can run these kinds of algorithms to understand. And then from there,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5495" target="_blank">01:31:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you say, "Okay, according to this set of documents, this is the ontology that has risen out of it." So you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5500" target="_blank">01:31:40.920</a></span> | <span class="t">can take a very organic approach. Sometimes people will go in with a very specific data model in mind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5508" target="_blank">01:31:48.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And even in those cases, I always encourage people to run the KG Builder for experimentation purposes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5514" target="_blank">01:31:54.120</a></span> | <span class="t">because it could be that there's something in your documents that you didn't even know was valuable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5519" target="_blank">01:31:59.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? Like, let them speak. Like, let them-- like, let the ontology rise. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5525" target="_blank">01:32:05.640</a></span> | <span class="t">The question is, like, I think today our industry has been writing content more for consumption by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5531" target="_blank">01:32:11.640</a></span> | <span class="t">humans. Now this is changing towards consumption by agents. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5536" target="_blank">01:32:16.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you see this playing the graph analytics and what you're showcasing is playing for persona,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5541" target="_blank">01:32:21.400</a></span> | <span class="t">for content writers, and whether for completeness, how are they writing and producing more content?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5546" target="_blank">01:32:26.360</a></span> | <span class="t">It's helping them?

Like, one of the things that I'm really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5554" target="_blank">01:32:34.280</a></span> | <span class="t">excited about is the concept of, like, I call it-- it's not about human in the loop. It's about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5561" target="_blank">01:32:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">accountability in the loop, right? Like we said, we're going agent to agent to agent. And so what do we then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5567" target="_blank">01:32:47.560</a></span> | <span class="t">pass to that agent, right? So if we have some of this information, right? Like, if we're concerned about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5573" target="_blank">01:32:53.480</a></span> | <span class="t">amplifying signal, right? And if we're concerned about, you know, like, a series of agents going in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5579" target="_blank">01:32:59.320</a></span> | <span class="t">the wrong direction, right? You think of a ship. If it's off by one degree now, it's fine. You know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5584" target="_blank">01:33:04.120</a></span> | <span class="t">a hundred miles later, not so fine. So how do we-- how do we keep steering the ship when it's autonomous?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5590" target="_blank">01:33:10.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's some of the interesting things, too. Like, when we look at this memory graph,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5594" target="_blank">01:33:14.120</a></span> | <span class="t">right, we can say-- like, this application graph, we can say, "Okay, I'm going to pass this to the agent,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5600" target="_blank">01:33:20.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and I'll pass, like, this context, or this particular information about what came before."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5605" target="_blank">01:33:25.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Or, you know, like, you can look at, like, sort of, like, the velocity of how quickly it's going from one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5611" target="_blank">01:33:31.480</a></span> | <span class="t">community to another, right? Like, there's so many interesting ways you can do the math to look at it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5615" target="_blank">01:33:35.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But yeah, like, I think, like, really understanding, like, how do we drive our agents?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5623" target="_blank">01:33:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">How do we drive our agents and chains is super sexy, super exciting for

given specific domain where we have embedding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5799" target="_blank">01:36:39.000</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">01:36:42.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5803" target="_blank">01:36:43.560</a></span> | <span class="t">There are actually really interesting ways that you can do combinations of not just the text</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5808" target="_blank">01:36:48.040</a></span> | <span class="t">embedding, but the embedding of the node itself, right?</span></div><div

have of this text embedding,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5815" target="_blank">01:36:55.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you can also do on the node.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5816" target="_blank">01:36:56.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it's an embedding, really, of the structure of any given node and which relationships it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5820"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5825" target="_blank">01:37:05.720</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the things that we, like, didn't get to today but is, like, you know, leveraging page</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5831" target="_blank">01:37:11.160</a></span> | <span class="t">rank and, you know,

definitely some interesting things that you can do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5836" target="_blank">01:37:16.440</a></span> |

bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5853" target="_blank">01:37:33.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So, like, how does it work?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5858" target="_blank">01:37:38.040</a></span> | <span class="t">What is happening?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5859" target="_blank">01:37:39.640</a></span> | <span class="t">All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5861" target="_blank">01:37:41.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we've got a few different ways that we can look at it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5866" target="_blank">01:37:46.920</a></span> | <span class="t">This is one example how Louvain actually works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5869" target="_blank">01:37:49.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So, like I said, what it'll start to do is it'll assign a label.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5874" target="_blank">01:37:54.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And then what it says is, okay, let me look at its neighbors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5878" target="_blank">01:37:58.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And if I give the neighbors the same label, does that modularity,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5882" target="_blank">01:38:02.200</a></span> | <span class="t">does that interconnectedness number get better or worse, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5886" target="_blank">01:38:06.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So, different clustering algorithms are going to do things different ways, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5889" target="_blank">01:38:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But in this case, this is what we're looking at.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5892" target="_blank">01:38:12.440</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like, and if you think about it, it's like, you know how you have some friends and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5897" target="_blank">01:38:17.480</a></span> | <span class="t">you all know each other, you're all really tight, but then you have this other friend</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5900" target="_blank">01:38:20.920</a></span> | <span class="t">who's got, like, all these different, like, friend groups that they're a part of.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5904" target="_blank">01:38:24.200</a></span> |

target="_blank">01:38:26.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it's kind of like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5907" target="_blank">01:38:27.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So, the more interconnected it is, the more relationships they have among each other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5912" target="_blank">01:38:32.760</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what it's looking for in the math.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5914" target="_blank">01:38:34.360</a></span> | <span class="t">How would this be of any use in terms of, like, getting the actual data

about the community detection,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5927" target="_blank">01:38:47.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the

target="_blank">01:38:51.640</a></span> | <span class="t">It's going to allow you to curate at scale,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5933" target="_blank">01:38:53.800</a></span> | <span class="t">it's going to allow you to understand at scale, like, where things are

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5955" target="_blank">01:39:15.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So, think of, if I'm, you know, I don't know, I'm in sales at

just bought luggage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5961" target="_blank">01:39:21.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not going to

target="_blank">01:39:28.360</a></span> | <span class="t">It's sort of like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5969" target="_blank">01:39:29.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So, in that case, it could be helpful, but from a content perspective,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxAQVbwBL4&t=5973" target="_blank">01:39:33.720</a></span> | <span class="t">it's like, do I want to give you just what you have,</span></div><div
