Abner, how's Shepherds Conference going for you? Ah, Gary, thanks for meeting with me. Yeah, it's, it's such a blessing. I'm so encouraged to see so many pastors all together, fellowshipping, celebrating the Lord and encouraging each other. And for me personally, not only is that encouraging, but the opportunity to serve them in so many different ways is such a joy to my own soul.</p><p>So this is a very busy time and it can be a very exhausting time, but it's a time that reminds us and gives us a foretaste of the fruitfulness of what the Lord is doing across the entire world. And so that is a great joy. Praise God. And Abner, because you're the lead translator, I'm sure you get asked tons of questions, but what is one of the most frequently asked questions to you?</p><p>Yeah, one of the most frequently asked questions is besides the changes of Yahweh and translating Dulas as slave, what really makes the LSB so unique? Well, why did you guys do it and, and why are those other kinds of changes significant? And of course, we often talk about the issue of consistency and for pastors who are going through the word of God and they're pointing things out.</p><p>Even John Piper did this in his recent message where he, or in the Q&A, where he said, look, Paul says those who loved Christ's coming, and then a verse or two later, Demas loved this present age. And people all just said, Oh, because they made the connection in the text.</p><p>And what our job is, is to make sure that those kinds of connections can be easily facilitated all over scripture because we're consistent. Awesome. Thank you Abner for your time.</p></div></div></body></html>
