Let's start doing some of those exercises and the hard work and figuring</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=793" target="_blank">00:13:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">out what that means." And then once we're on that path, that's when you start looking at your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=801" target="_blank">00:13:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">finances and saying, "How can I now build a path to financial independence or a financial structure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=806" target="_blank">00:13:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that supports that purpose, identity, and connections?" And that way, we can be really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=810" target="_blank">00:13:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">intentional about why we make money, how we make money, and what we're doing this all for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=815" target="_blank">00:13:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">When we don't do that purpose and identity work first, we are chasing after money as a goal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=821" target="_blank">00:13:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And often, we don't even know why. We get this idea of a certain net worth or we get this idea</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=826" target="_blank">00:13:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">of a certain job position, and it sounds great, and it sounds meaningful. But a lot of times,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=832" target="_blank">00:13:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">when we get to that place, we get to that net worth, or we get to that job we were so excited</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=836" target="_blank">00:13:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">about, we actually feel more depressed as opposed to happy. And there's a few reasons for that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=841" target="_blank">00:14:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">One is because money is a little bit of a false goal, looking at your bank account isn't going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=844" target="_blank">00:14:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">to make you feel more purposeful or give you a better sense of identity. So when you get to that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=848" target="_blank">00:14:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">place, you thought that was so great, like a million dollars in the bank, most likely, two</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=852" target="_blank">00:14:12.720</a></span> | <span class="t">things are going to happen. One, you're going to start saying, "Oh, well, I don't feel as good as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=855" target="_blank">00:14:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I thought I'd feel. Maybe I have to start going after 1.5 or 2 million." So before you know it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=860" target="_blank">00:14:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you're right back on the treadmill trying to make more. The other thing is this idea of loss</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=864" target="_blank">00:14:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">aversion. The fear of losing is almost twice as bad as the fear of never getting there in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=868" target="_blank">00:14:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">first place. The minute you get to that million dollar net worth, or you get to that job promotion</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=872" target="_blank">00:14:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">that was so exciting, you start worrying about losing it. Like, "Oh my God, the market's going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=877" target="_blank">00:14:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">to change. Something's going to happen. I'm going to have this big expense, and all of a sudden,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=880" target="_blank">00:14:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not going to have my million dollars anymore." And that actually causes us to be more fearful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=884" target="_blank">00:14:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">than happy. And I see this, especially in the financial independence movement. When people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=887" target="_blank">00:14:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">get to financial independence, they get to that net worth number, and they find themselves crushed,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=892" target="_blank">00:14:52.720</a></span> | <span class="t">anxious, and afraid. And the reason why is because none of those things really have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=896" target="_blank">00:14:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">real sense of purpose and identity. There's no meaning in those things. They're just these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=901" target="_blank">00:15:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">easy goals we set up. And they're really easy because they keep us from doing the hard work</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=906" target="_blank">00:15:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">of trying to figure out purpose and identity. It's really easy to go for the low-hanging fruit. It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=911" target="_blank">00:15:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">really comfortable. It's what society expects of us. We can go on Instagram and see all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=917" target="_blank">00:15:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">pictures of people taking beautiful vacations and having beautiful things. And it's really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=921" target="_blank">00:15:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">easy to strive for all that. But in the end, I don't think it makes us happy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=925" target="_blank">00:15:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, that's kind of where I'm coming at this from. That's why I realized when I started looking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=932" target="_blank">00:15:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">into personal finance, I started blogging and podcasting, I was already financially independent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=936" target="_blank">00:15:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So, to me, it wasn't really exciting to go, "Okay, how do I invest?

It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=2910" target="_blank">00:48:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of foggy in my mind. I don't know what to do." It's a really great way of assessing where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=2915" target="_blank">00:48:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">your parents are, because then they're going to feel like they're giving you advice. So they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=2918" target="_blank">00:48:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">going to be open. They're not thinking you're like, "Mom, Dad, when you die, what am I going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=2922" target="_blank">00:48:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to get of yours?" That's not what you're asking them. You're saying, "I need to do this for my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=2926" target="_blank">00:48:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">family. What should we do?" It's a great way to broach the subject and get a feel for how much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=2931" target="_blank">00:48:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">thinking they've done on this. You may find that they've done tons of thinking about it. They have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=2936" target="_blank">00:48:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">their wills and their trust, and they can actually tell you and help you do it yourself. Or they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=2941" target="_blank">00:49:01.200</a></span> | <span class="t">might look at you and say, "Hmm, we've never thought about this before." And that's a perfect</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=2944" target="_blank">00:49:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">chance to say, "Well, I'm doing it. You want to do this together?" It's a great way to start the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=2950" target="_blank">00:49:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">conversation. That's less than one way to do it. Another way I really like to broach the conversation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=2955" target="_blank">00:49:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">is, being in hospice, I've seen some real tragedies. So it's easy for me to approach my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=2962" target="_blank">00:49:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">parents and say, "I was taking care of this guy, and his mom was sick, and she had Alzheimer's.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=2968" target="_blank">00:49:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And the dad had taken over everything, the medical power of attorney. He had taken over the finances</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=2974" target="_blank">00:49:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">for the family. And my patient, he was really happy. His parents were managing all these things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=2980" target="_blank">00:49:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">because his mom was getting sick, and he just wanted to be with his mom. Then COVID came along,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=2984" target="_blank">00:49:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and all of a sudden, his dad got sick and was on a ventilator. And guess what? I didn't have the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=2990" target="_blank">00:49:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">financial power of attorney. My patient couldn't pay for his mom's needs because his dad was on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=2995" target="_blank">00:49:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">a ventilator, and he didn't have any rights to all the financial paperwork, to the checking account,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3000" target="_blank">00:50:00.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to any of that. So I've experienced these things. And I could go to my parents and say, "You know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3005" target="_blank">00:50:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">what? The funniest thing happened to one of my patients." Tell that story and say, "Gosh, I hope</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3010" target="_blank">00:50:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">that kind of thing doesn't happen to us." And so by talking about how other people have had these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3016" target="_blank">00:50:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">bad experiences, it's a wonderful way to actually breach the conversation with your loved ones.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3021" target="_blank">00:50:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's a real non-confrontational, easy way. So that's another way to do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3024" target="_blank">00:50:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And the last way I really like to do it is to talk about it in terms of legacy. So instead of saying,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3029" target="_blank">00:50:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">"When you die, who's going to get what stuff of yours?" To go to your parents and say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3034" target="_blank">00:50:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">"You know what? My kids are young, and I as well as I want my kids to really remember you the way</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3043" target="_blank">00:50:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">you are after you're gone." Let's talk about how you want to be remembered. What do you want the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3049" target="_blank">00:50:49.760</a></span> | <span class="t">kids to have of you? What do you want them to remember? What is your legacy? And a lot of times</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3054" target="_blank">00:50:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">that leads to talking about things even like property. Like mom and dad, every year we take</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3060" target="_blank">00:51:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">all the grandkids and we go to that cabin that you guys own in Wisconsin. After you die, what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3066" target="_blank">00:51:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">should be done with that? Do you want us to still do that and think of you every year when we go do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3071" target="_blank">00:51:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">this? Do you want us to sell it? What would you want done with this thing?" But by framing it in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3076" target="_blank">00:51:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">terms of their legacy, I think then you can open up the difficult conversation and make it about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3086" target="_blank">00:51:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">celebrating the people we're talking about. Because the idea behind this, and no one thinks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3090" target="_blank">00:51:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">of it this way, but really estate planning should be a celebration of people's lives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3094" target="_blank">00:51:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">We should celebrate with their medical legacy planning, like living will, medical power of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3102" target="_blank">00:51:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">attorney.

With their financial legacy documents, like their wills and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3112" target="_blank">00:51:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">their trust, we're celebrating all they've achieved economically, all the things they've acquired and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3118" target="_blank">00:51:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">how those things are going to continue in the world after they're gone and they're going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3121" target="_blank">00:52:01.520</a></span> | <span class="t">stay present in our lives. If we can reframe this as a celebration, I really think it makes it much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3127" target="_blank">00:52:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">more approachable and it makes the conversations much easier. Yeah, you just gave me an idea,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3132" target="_blank">00:52:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">which I think is really interesting. Two things came from this when I was just listening. One,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3138" target="_blank">00:52:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">something I want to make sure my wife and I do is, and I wish that we had done with my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3143" target="_blank">00:52:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">grandparents, is take some time to capture who they are, their story, whether that's on video,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3149" target="_blank">00:52:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">whether that's written, so you have something to share. That's just something that's top of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3153" target="_blank">00:52:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">mind for me. I saw Sean, I think from My First Million, posted that he did a podcast with his</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3161" target="_blank">00:52:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">mom, where he interviewed his mom like he was doing an interview, but he didn't publish it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3166" target="_blank">00:52:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">He didn't go out and share it with the world. He just did it because he wanted to have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3171" target="_blank">00:52:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">an archive of a conversation he had. So that was one, which I thought was just really interesting,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3175" target="_blank">00:52:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">was trying to document these people that are important in your lives that won't be there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3179" target="_blank">00:52:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">forever. But the other is talking about ways that you could keep alive things. So in your case,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3186" target="_blank">00:53:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">there's an actual physical cabin, right? So that might be something that's a lot easier and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3192" target="_blank">00:53:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">tangible. But if your family has really loved going to a cabin, but always renting it, maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3198" target="_blank">00:53:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">you could ask your parents, if you have money left over, yeah, you could give it to someone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3203" target="_blank">00:53:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">But is there anything you want to do with it? You think about people with tons of money, and they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3207" target="_blank">00:53:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">grant these scholarships, so kids could go to school under a program. Or I remember my sister's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3213" target="_blank">00:53:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">college, someone donated a pool of money, and the whole purpose of it was enough money that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3219" target="_blank">00:53:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the interest on the donation would be able to buy a passport for every kid at the university that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3224" target="_blank">00:53:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">never had one. And I thought that was so cool. And I'm now thinking, oh, if I have money when I die,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3230" target="_blank">00:53:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I would love to not just leave it, but also leave a purpose for it. I would love you to take this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3235" target="_blank">00:53:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">money and take a trip every year. And you know, like we took when we were, you know, that kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3241" target="_blank">00:54:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">of thing. So trying to talk about this with your parents, but maybe to turn their legacy into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3247" target="_blank">00:54:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">something tangible that you can bring to life with your family, and can be passed on is is a really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3252" target="_blank">00:54:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">interesting idea that I'd never thought about. I think our lives are like a stone being dropped in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3257" target="_blank">00:54:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the ocean. We are here for so little time. And once we break the water, we're gone. But the ripple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3263" target="_blank">00:54:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">effect of that stone can carry on for miles and miles and miles. And so a lot of the thought is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3271" target="_blank">00:54:31.520</a></span> | <span class="t">what is going to be the ripple of my life. And so I'm convinced that living this life of meaning and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3277" target="_blank">00:54:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">purpose is going to affect those people around you by thinking about your legacy planning by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3282" target="_blank">00:54:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">setting aside money to do those important things.

I imagine those in their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3296" target="_blank">00:54:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">final days would find it comforting to know that what they care about is going to, you know, kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3302" target="_blank">00:55:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">of transcend their own life into others. Yeah, totally. I mean, it's about legacy. And that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3306" target="_blank">00:55:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">why I think we should call it legacy planning.

And that's what the book is mostly about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3679" target="_blank">01:01:19.520</a></span> | <span class="t">is learning to bring more purpose in your life, whether you have money or not.

That's point one. Then we can mess with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3689" target="_blank">01:01:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">the perception of time.

The point about thinking about this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3710" target="_blank">01:01:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">is just if we know how we feel about time, we can change some things to help us perceive it a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3717" target="_blank">01:01:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">bit better. Right. And a lot of this is very personal. It depends who you are.

So strangely enough, I feel like I have all the time in the world. So I feel really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3847" target="_blank">01:04:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">now a place of time abundance. And I think there are a few reasons for that. One is I wake up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3855" target="_blank">01:04:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">really early.

And the strange thing, when you wake up at 435 in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3860" target="_blank">01:04:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">morning, you just feel like your days last forever. So for me, that's a great way to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3865" target="_blank">01:04:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">combat these worries about time. The other thing is because I've been real thoughtful over the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3872" target="_blank">01:04:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">years and have been financially successful as well as in other realms of my life, I've really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3876" target="_blank">01:04:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">been able to subtract out the things I hate. And so I feel like partially I have an abundance of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3881" target="_blank">01:04:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">time because I've been able to get rid of the things I don't like, all those things about work</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3885" target="_blank">01:04:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I didn't like, being on call, working weekends, all those stressors in my life. So I think that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3890" target="_blank">01:04:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">a good thing for us to do, whether we have lots of money or not, is to say, how can we substitute</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3894" target="_blank">01:04:54.720</a></span> | <span class="t">things we like in place of things we don't like and start getting rid of those things we don't?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3900" target="_blank">01:05:00.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I've also do some other kind of daily habits that really helped me. I like something called</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3906" target="_blank">01:05:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">work bursting. So as opposed to spending lots of time doing important things, I like to set a good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3912" target="_blank">01:05:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">two hours aside or an hour and do really hard stuff in a real concentrated burst of energy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3918" target="_blank">01:05:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I put it down and I do something leisurely for the next few hours. So it makes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3924" target="_blank">01:05:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">me feel like I have a lot of time in my days because that really hard concentrated work,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3929" target="_blank">01:05:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I do in short bursts. And so I really enjoy doing that. There are also some hacks. I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3934" target="_blank">01:05:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">in the book, I talk a little bit about Parkinson's law and the Pareto principle. We can talk about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3938" target="_blank">01:05:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that now if you want. But this idea that we can take advantage of these principles, like Parkinson's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3945" target="_blank">01:05:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">law says that basically the time you have to do a task will end up being the amount of time it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3951" target="_blank">01:05:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">takes to do that task. So if you have a task and you have five hours to do it, it's going to take</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3956" target="_blank">01:05:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you five hours to do. On the other hand, if the same task, you only have two hours to do it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3959" target="_blank">01:05:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">it's going to take you two hours to do. So you can play around with this a little bit by,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3964" target="_blank">01:06:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">for instance, halving the amount of time you give yourself to do things. So if something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3967" target="_blank">01:06:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">normally takes you five hours, say, "Okay, I'm only going to do it in two hours." Most likely,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3973" target="_blank">01:06:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">you'll get 80 to 90% of the quality by spending a lot less time doing it. And there's some other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3978" target="_blank">01:06:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">tricks you can do. A big part of that, especially when you're doing these tasks, especially if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3983" target="_blank">01:06:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">they're burdensome, is being really clear about defining what done looks like. And so making a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3990" target="_blank">01:06:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">goal of what done looks like, and then deciding that when you hit that point, you'll stop. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=3994" target="_blank">01:06:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">it's unrelated to time, because often we go way past what's appropriate, especially if we feel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=4000" target="_blank">01:06:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">like we have five hours allotted to something instead of two. So I think there's some other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=4003" target="_blank">01:06:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">tricks and hacks you can do. But the idea is to be thoughtful about how you use time most</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=4009" target="_blank">01:06:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">efficiently, and then put those things in place to give you the sense of time abundance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=4015" target="_blank">01:06:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">You mentioned that you used to be in a place where you were filled with time stress and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=4019" target="_blank">01:06:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">running around trying to get more and more done.

I think it's about being really thoughtful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=4038" target="_blank">01:07:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, a lot of us who are successful are used to being super efficient. It's how we got to our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=4044" target="_blank">01:07:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">success because we could do three things at once, or we could get more done in a day than other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=4048" target="_blank">01:07:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">people. And I love that, right? I think that's really served me at times in my career. But the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=4054" target="_blank">01:07:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">other side is you become so super efficient that it becomes anxiety provoking. And then instead</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=4061" target="_blank">01:07:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">of feeling time abundance, you start feeling time scarcity. And it's the oddest thing that the more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=4066" target="_blank">01:07:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">efficient we get, the more we start cramping more and more into smaller spaces and start convincing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=4072" target="_blank">01:07:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">yourself we don't have enough time, so we start rushing through things. So for me, I've had to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=4077" target="_blank">01:07:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">really let go of the reins and really put things in place so that I don't have as much control over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=4083" target="_blank">01:08:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">time. So one of those ways is, again, as opposed to rushing around to go somewhere, I now let</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=4089" target="_blank">01:08:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">someone else decide our timeframe and make myself stick to what they want. And so I unload that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=4098" target="_blank">01:08:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">worry about time because I've gotten so good and efficient at time that I'm rushing everywhere,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdR7GFGlBPg&t=4102" target="_blank">01:08:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and I knew that had to stop.
