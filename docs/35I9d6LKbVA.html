You got to balance the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35I9d6LKbVA&t=2828" target="_blank">00:47:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">chemicals on the hot tub. And like, it's kind of fun. I take my two and a half year old daughter,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35I9d6LKbVA&t=2832" target="_blank">00:47:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">we go scoop up a little water, we put it in this thing, and we see the chemicals,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35I9d6LKbVA&t=2835" target="_blank">00:47:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and we measure it out.

But it's something that, "Oh, we got to do that this week." So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35I9d6LKbVA&t=2841" target="_blank">00:47:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">we could hire someone to come to the house and do it.

So for someone to come to the house and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35I9d6LKbVA&t=2860" target="_blank">00:47:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">put some chemicals in the hot tub, it takes five minutes. I'm sure the cost for that is going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35I9d6LKbVA&t=2866" target="_blank">00:47:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">be more than an average hourly wage times five over 60. It's just going to be much more expensive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35I9d6LKbVA&t=2873" target="_blank">00:47:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">than that, I assume. I've looked a little bit. And so it's just hard for me to be like, "I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35I9d6LKbVA&t=2877" target="_blank">00:47:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">going to pay someone $200 a month to come to my house for five minutes three times."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35I9d6LKbVA&t=2880" target="_blank">00:48:00.640</a></span> | <span class="t">But you're not factoring your brain cost?

Yeah. So what's not maintenance work? I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35I9d6LKbVA&t=2933" target="_blank">00:48:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">that's a really important question. What is not maintenance? So in life, maintenance is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35I9d6LKbVA&t=2937" target="_blank">00:48:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">cleaning your car is maintenance. Doing your bed is maintenance. Cooking food is maintenance,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35I9d6LKbVA&t=2942" target="_blank">00:49:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">right? To maintain your thing. What I think is not maintenance is building relationships,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35I9d6LKbVA&t=2948" target="_blank">00:49:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">building family. Because if I invest today in my wife or my husband or whatever, in the future,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35I9d6LKbVA&t=2954" target="_blank">00:49:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">it results in a nice family. So I don't view that as maintenance. I view that as building</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35I9d6LKbVA&t=2958" target="_blank">00:49:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">for the future, building a company, building a career, and building your body, focusing on your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35I9d6LKbVA&t=2964" target="_blank">00:49:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">fitness and physique. I think those are the four things I've identified as non-maintenance things,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35I9d6LKbVA&t=2969" target="_blank">00:49:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and I'm happy to invest in them. I invest a lot. So because I'm single now, unfortunately,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35I9d6LKbVA&t=2974" target="_blank">00:49:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I invest a lot of my time into fitness and building my business. I have two companies,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35I9d6LKbVA&t=2979" target="_blank">00:49:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">so I'm building those. So that's the only thing I view as non-maintenance work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35I9d6LKbVA&t=2984" target="_blank">00:49:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Everything else is maintenance.

And I'm curious, what is it about your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35I9d6LKbVA&t=3008" target="_blank">00:50:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">style of travel, your belief about money?

But mentally, I feel poor,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35I9d6LKbVA&t=3033" target="_blank">00:50:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and I don't know why.
