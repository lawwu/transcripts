As David</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwmBZIHrZ6k&t=2398" target="_blank">00:39:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Powelson well notes that if you are anxious about financial concerns, then it reveals a desire for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwmBZIHrZ6k&t=2407" target="_blank">00:40:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">financial security. Or if you're most anxious about physical illness, then it reveals a desire for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwmBZIHrZ6k&t=2415" target="_blank">00:40:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">physical health.

And the heart is always characterized by desire. If I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwmBZIHrZ6k&t=2428" target="_blank">00:40:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">am up at night and I'm anxious about my children's education or my children's wellbeing, or what are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwmBZIHrZ6k&t=2435" target="_blank">00:40:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">they doing in life?

And so what you are most anxious about reveals what you most</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwmBZIHrZ6k&t=2449" target="_blank">00:40:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">desire.

But as you look at the number of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwmBZIHrZ6k&t=2464" target="_blank">00:41:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">ways that fear presents itself, you will find that the heart is always desiring a certain outcome</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwmBZIHrZ6k&t=2472" target="_blank">00:41:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">or a certain thing. And that brings us to values.

You will note what you tend to worship when you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwmBZIHrZ6k&t=2488" target="_blank">00:41:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">see what you are most anxious about. Sinfully, that is where you will find the idolatry of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwmBZIHrZ6k&t=2497" target="_blank">00:41:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">heart saying to a certain thing or person or event, "You are my greatest treasure.

And so the thoughts and desires and the values of the heart are always expressing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwmBZIHrZ6k&t=2511" target="_blank">00:41:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">themselves in certain behavior. Now you will note here, again, watch the interaction between physical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwmBZIHrZ6k&t=2519" target="_blank">00:41:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and spiritual. The values of the heart, the immaterial man, the immaterial aspect of man,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwmBZIHrZ6k&t=2529" target="_blank">00:42:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the values of a worshiping heart. Let's say, for example, if I most value and worship my physical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwmBZIHrZ6k&t=2537" target="_blank">00:42:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">health. So I'm spending all my time at the gym and I'm eating only vegetables and bran. And there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwmBZIHrZ6k&t=2546" target="_blank">00:42:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">nothing wrong with that if that's what you want to do. But let's just say, for example, that my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwmBZIHrZ6k&t=2550" target="_blank">00:42:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">idolatry is my physical health.

And then because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwmBZIHrZ6k&t=2571" target="_blank">00:42:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm most treasuring my physical health, then I'm up at night worried about what's going to happen</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwmBZIHrZ6k&t=2579" target="_blank">00:42:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">in the future, worried about certain physical illnesses.
