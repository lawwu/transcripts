Right now we're doing a bonus episode where you guys get to be curious and ask me questions. So let's get it going. So for this bonus episode, we had you guys comment on an Instagram post, questions you wanted to ask me.</p><p>And so that's what we're going to do right now. I'm going to answer y'all's questions. I'm going to have my sister ask them to me. I haven't seen any of them, so let's get it going. Let's get it going. Okay. So it's 204. We're not going to get through all of them, but we will start with something easy.</p><p>Okay. How has Denver helped you develop and grow not only as a Hooper, but as an individual? Yeah, I mean, I think when I first got drafted to Denver, I had never even visited Denver and I didn't really know what to expect. But then going out there, it was like I fell in love with the city instantly.</p><p>The people are so down to earth, you know, it's a very healthy culture. I've met tons of great people. So off the court, it's been really just relaxing for me. It's a chill city, but you can still have fun. And then on the court, I mean, we got one of the best young teams in the league.</p><p>I'm surrounded by a group of great dudes. I think one thing that makes our team unique is just how selfless we are as a team. Like everyone wants to see each other succeed. And that's really refreshing to be on a team like that, because you hear stories of guys that used to play on other teams coming to Denver, and it didn't used to be like that.</p><p>So it's definitely a blessing to be on a team like that. For sure. Okay. What are your season superstitions or pregame rituals? Yeah, I don't really have too many superstitions. I think a lot of players ask me about what separates NBA players from other players. And I think one thing is just the routine.</p><p>So I don't have any superstitions, but I do have a routine that I stick to very closely before games. That just includes all my pregame lifts, my pregame stretching. I try to eat similar things every game day. And then before I go out on the court, I always say like a prayer, and I try to read some scripture of the Bible just to calm my nerves and help me realize what's really important before I go out to play a game, because you can get in the thought process of how important the game is, but there's way more important things going on.</p><p>So when I could refocus my thinking, it just lets me go out there and play free and not worry too much about the outcome, just be in the moment. That's good. I feel like you can tell the games where you're really playing free and just... Yeah. I mean, I think it's...</p><p>Some players, when they are really, really just locked in, thinking a lot, play their best. But for me, when I'm playing free, just letting instinct take over and just being myself, then that's when I have by far the best game. When I'm in my head or whatever, it's definitely not as free-flowing.</p><p>Yeah. Okay. This is actually a really good question. What was it like having to sit out basically your whole college season, and what type of toll did it take on your mental health? This is something that a lot of people, they do know, but they don't really know the extent of it.</p><p>So that was definitely a trying time of my life because my whole basketball career was just easy, easy, easy. I remember being ranked for the first time in the eighth grade, I think I was 25th. And then after that, it was just, I was rising to the top super quick until all of a sudden I was the number one player in the country.</p><p>And then I committed to Mizzou, going back home, everybody was super excited and everything. And people were just treating me like I was like a god or something, walking around campus. It was crazy. Everywhere I went, people, it was just, it was crazy. So then that first game, when I, I told my dad, I remember telling dad, I'm like, "Dad, I can't play.</p><p>I'm going through warm-up lines and I can't really jump. I don't know what's going on." And so, but the TV had already had the starters ready to announce. So coach was just like, "Mike, you've got to start the game, but we'll pull you out right away." And I was like, "Dang." So I go in, knowing I'm coming out.</p><p>And then I end up going to the locker room and I get on the phone with the doctor and he's like asking me if I can do certain things and I'm trying it, you know, trying all these different exercises, whatever. I'm like, "I can't do these right now. I don't know what's going on." And he's like, "Man, like, yeah, you're going to, you're probably going to have to get surgery." Like, I remember he told me that.</p><p>I was like, "Oh." Like, I had no idea, like, because I had never had any injuries. I didn't know that that's how you found out you were going to have to have surgery. Yeah, like, he just told me because I couldn't do something that he had asked if I could do through the phone.</p><p>And so then I remember, I remember just when that announcement came out, the next couple days it was like, it was a serious injury and I was probably going to have to have surgery. Man, it felt like the whole Mizzou fan base, everybody who, everybody just, you know, it turned, like all that love turned into hate.</p><p>Not necessarily hate, but it was like that love wasn't really there. I heard people telling me, you know, "You're just sitting out a college game so that you can, like, skip college and go to the NBA." I had people saying, like, it was all types of stuff. People were sending me crazy DMs, all this crazy stuff, like, and I was a young kid, so it was just, that definitely took a toll on my mental.</p><p>How old were you? Were you 18? I was probably 17 or 18. I was 18, 18, 19, probably 18. But I was so used to everything being so easy for me basketball-wise that when that happened, it was just, like, it was kind of devastating to me, I'm not going to lie.</p><p>But then I remember, you know, going through that process of the year rehab and really deciding early on in that rehab process, "No, I'm going to use this for my benefit." My whole life, people have been praising me, whatever, but this is a time where I can really focus on my mental strength, find an identity outside of basketball, and so that's what I took it as.</p><p>And you know, I had doctors telling me I might not play again. All this crazy stuff. I mean, you were in the hospital. You heard me some of those nights when that pain was crazy, and I was just like, "See, come on." Let me tell that story real quick.</p><p>Yeah, go ahead. Okay, so we were, he was in Chicago training for the draft, and it was after you got through all the rehab of your first surgery, and everything was going pretty smooth, like, your workouts were good, you were looking really healthy. And then one night, I know your back was bothering you that day a little bit, and then one night, it was late, it was probably like 1 or 2 in the morning, I was knocked, I was knocked out.</p><p>And then all of a sudden, I hear boom, boom, boom on the wall. I woke up so fast. I thought there was a robber. I thought there was someone. I text you from my room. I was like, "Oh my gosh, Michael, did you hear that? Somebody's breaking in." And you were like, you text me back, you're like, "That was me.</p><p>Can you get me some ice?" I was like, "It's not funny. It's really not funny." But I was like, "That's crazy." Because I've never, you never handle pain like that. You never, people thought you were just being soft, I'm like, "That is the realest thing I've ever seen." Yeah, no.</p><p>So, yeah, what she's talking about, I remember that so vividly, but I had, so basically I had used that whole year of Mizzou for rehab, and then I was getting healthy again, you know, getting ready for the pre-draft, feeling decent. And then what ended up happening was, I don't think I re-injured it, I think it was a different level of my back or whatever that flared up.</p><p>So I ended up having to get another surgery. And realizing how much effort and time took into that first rehab, and realizing I was going to have to do that again, even though I was thinking that first rehab period, I'm going to use this for my benefit, you know, really try to get mentally strong.</p><p>Once I heard the news that I was going to have to have a second surgery, it was like, that definitely put me into a depression mode for a little bit, because I was like, "Dang, all this time spent, and I'm going to have to do it all over again, and now people are really going to be scared.</p><p>These teams that are drafting me are really going to be scared." So that's really what happened draft-wise, you know, people are like, "Why did he draft a 14?" It was because of that reason, like a lot of teams got scared once they realized I was going to have to have the second surgery.</p><p>I mean, rightfully so. The doctor who wrote my report said that he didn't think I was going to play again. So all these teams got really scared. And I was kind of scared myself, but I just knew in my head, like, "No, like, this is my purpose. I'm supposed to walk out my purpose through basketball." And so that's why, back to the earlier question, Denver.</p><p>When Denver drafted me, and they showed that they believed in me, that just made me, like I said at draft night, and I still say it today, like I want to be the best draft pick that Denver's ever had, because just of the fact that they believed in me, they trusted my work ethic, you know, all these things, it just makes me want to help give back to the program.</p><p>And also, you know, I'm, because of God, like I'm healing, like I feel good, better than ever, and it's just dope. But back to that question, I think through all of this, now, looking back at that, I think those two years, two-plus years of rehab, and just time away from basketball and getting to focus on my mental, not really being in the spotlight, all these things, it helped create the person that I am today.</p><p>And I don't think that I would be who I am today without that period of time. If I had just got drafted, been the number one pick, whatever, who knows where I would be without the adversity. So I really viewed, like I used to think that it was the devil attacking me, like all this stuff happening because of the devil, but now I view it like, no, God realized there's way more important things than basketball.</p><p>I want you to become this certain type of person. So I'm going to put you through this really hard thing, and like looking back, it's like the biggest blessing I could have ever had. And I think, too, like you said, you had to go through that adversity. I think that it teaches you that the God that's in the valley with you, the God that's in the pit with you, is the same God that's there with you on the peaks.</p><p>So you're going to have these successes now. You're pretty well-known now, and I don't think you would have handled that as well unless you learned that the God that's with you in the valley doesn't leave you, and he's with you in the peaks, and it's still for him. He's still the reason.</p><p>I don't think I would have handled the success as well, and I just think that there's no telling like who I would even be. I mean, who knows if all these things, if the NBA, whatever, would have changed me. I've seen a lot of people changed by all these things, changed by money, changed by fame, and when I got to become my own person, aside from basketball, basketball, you know, since I was three years old, it was all I did.</p><p>When I got that break from basketball and got to focus on me, I got to really take time to develop me, and I think that that is going to take me farther in life than basketball ever could. And God will always, like when you give your life to God, he's always going to prune you, so I just view it as like a pruning process.</p><p>I never would have become or fulfill my purpose for him if I wouldn't have went through that adversity, so I view it as a blessing. Next question. This one's, I like this one because it references one of the episodes. So in the podcast with Aunt Nancy, you mentioned that you accepted God and Christ, but it was more recent that you started to actually live for him.</p><p>What are some ways that you embody Christ-like behavior when it's hard to? Yeah, well, I think that, like I gave my life to God early on when I was little, but I never really like really tried to live it out for myself until I got to college and I realized I could do anything, whatever, and then I realized that's not what I want to be doing.</p><p>So now it's definitely a continual process, and every single year I'm trying to like grow in different characteristics or whatever. I saw a good quote on Instagram, someone had posted on their story, it was like, "The scariest thing in the world is to be in the same place that you were last year," and then it was like, "Grow," and I think that that's all I've tried to do.</p><p>I mean, it's hard for anybody when they're not feeling like it to embody Christ, but I think that the way you do it is spending more time with him and more time of things that are going to fill you up with good stuff instead of the bad things. So for me, it's just being consistent in my Bible reading every morning, being consistent in some of the good music I listen to as well, or some of the good inputs, because I really feel like you've got a good wolf and a bad wolf inside of you, and it's whatever one you feed more is going to be winning.</p><p>And I think that that's an overall theme for your life, but it's also a daily theme. If you have more bad input that day than good input, you might act out a little bit more that day, but if you're filling yourself up that day with good things, then you're probably going to have more fruit that day.</p><p>So that's what I try to do. >> That's really good. I think this is a good question too, and it's, "How do you balance discouragement when you're not seeing results but you're working hard?" I think that you can kind of tie that into the whole bad wolf, good wolf thing.</p><p>>> Say that question one more time. How do you balance discouragement when not seeing results but you're working hard? I'm sure you've gone through periods of time where you're working really hard, and everyone goes through stuff when they're working hard and they plateau, or they aren't seeing the results.</p><p>You can be working really hard in practice and it's not translating to on the court. Even your first year healthy, you probably didn't get the minutes that you felt like you wanted to get. How do you balance that? >> I think it's keeping your overall goals and your overall vision for your life in mind, and realizing everything that God's gotten you through.</p><p>He's gotten you through those plateaus before, but the plateaus are going to happen again. When you're in a plateau, staying consistent. If you don't fall off the rail and get into all your old bad habits and all these things, and you stay consistent, stay consistent, then you're going to see a growth spurt.</p><p>It might plateau a little bit again, but if you stay consistent, you're going to see another growth spurt. Life is never just an uphill the whole time. In that, realizing there's going to be plateaus and times when you're not really seeing the results of your hard work, those are the times you have to make sure that you're mentally strong and staying consistent in your grind.</p><p>>> For sure. Where do you see yourself in 10 years? Do NBA players play for 10 years, or is that like a way- >> Yeah, no, they play for 10 years. LeBron's like- >> Okay, let's just change it to where like, yeah, he's been playing forever. Let's change it to like post-basketball, because- >> Post-basketball, well, for me, I think I only want to play about 10 more years.</p><p>I want to play like two or three big contracts, and then call it a day, because I want to be done when I still feel great. But I think 10 years from now, I'm definitely going to be married. I'm definitely going to have a few babies. I think once I'm done with basketball, I want to take some time, get off of all social media, and just disappear for like a year or two, and go travel the world with my wife and my family, and just disconnect from the entire world.</p><p>As basketball players, we're very used to being in the spotlight. I want to know what it feels like to just live life without people judging all your moves and everything, and just find some peace that way. So that's something I've always wanted to do. >> I bet that would be harder than you think, because when you're used to getting affirmation from thousands of people, just going off the radar, and just living it.</p><p>>> It definitely would be hard, but it's something that I feel like I've always wanted to do. >> Yeah. You've talked about that before. >> Yeah. >> Okay. We're going to do one last one. Let me find a really good one. So you live such a busy lifestyle. How do you keep authentic, genuine relationships with friends and family?</p><p>>> Yeah, I think it's impossible to be intentional and be super close with 100 different people. So for me, it's my family, and then a few people outside of my family, and really trying to nurture those relationships, and be intentional about hitting them up. If they call me, I'm intentional about trying to pick up their calls.</p><p>I can't do that for tons of different people, but there's definitely a few people that I've decided that I want in my life, and those are the ones I have to nurture. So I think it's just, but one thing I've learned is it really is intentionality, because it's something that I lack.</p><p>I tend to just want to go through days, and free flowing, whatever happens, happens. But to really grow relationships, and to really, it takes a lot of intentionality, because everyone's busy. Everyone's so busy doing their thing. Even the family, everyone's here right now on vacation together, and I'm like, "Dang, I don't even hit up Isaac that much.</p><p>I don't talk to Javon as much as I should." >> Yeah. I mean, it's because we're all doing our own things, but it's just intentionality. >> But, okay, I want to dig a little deeper on that. Do you think it's hard for you when most people, not people in your life, but most people in the world have you on a pedestal, but then to, in your genuine relationships and friendships, level that playing field?</p><p>>> That's super important, I think, and that's one of the reasons that I don't think that I will ever change with any success, or money, or anything, because I have people in my life that know me for me, and if I got injured and never played again, they'd be the same towards me.</p><p>If I become the best player in the world, they'd be the same towards me. That's my family, and then my friends outside of my family that I'm close to, so it definitely is harder, but I have a good intuition. I can tell right off the bat people's intentions, girls and dudes, just if they want something from me, and then that just makes you, it definitely makes you put yourself in a shell a little bit, like you don't really want to branch out to meet more people, but I'm also just like I got seven siblings, two parents that love me, great friends, like I don't need that much more.</p><p>>> Twenty more, yeah, yeah. >> Yeah, I don't need that much more. All I need is a shorty. >> Cool. Just a shorty. There was a lot of questions about that on here, but I didn't ask them. >> Ask a shorty a question. >> Okay, there was a lot of, like, what are you looking for in a woman?</p><p>>> Oh, you got to be bad for sure, but besides, I mean, before bad, you definitely have to have a relationship with God, because I'm not trying to pull someone along with me as I'm trying to, you know, run after my purpose for God, so you have to be on your own already pursuing God, and a lot of girls will trick you.</p><p>They'll act way more spiritual or religious, even though I don't consider myself religious, but way more spiritual, way more into that stuff, just so that you are interested. So you got to be able to see through that, but definitely that, number one, but before that, I definitely got to be attracted to you, and then besides that, I think being independent, like a lot of, but it's a balance between being independent and being, like, servant-hearted, because my mom is so servant-hearted, and I know the lifestyle I live, traveling, whatever, I need a girl who's, like, going to hold it down and, you know, be down for that, because there's a lot of girls who just want to chase after their dreams as well, and you can do that, but it has to be a balance of being there for me, and also, and then you got to be funny, too, because I like to play around a lot, joke around a lot, and then one thing that I value very, very much is, like, genuineness, down-to-earthness, someone who can just go be spontaneous with me, and isn't bougie, I can't stand bougie girls.</p><p>- Yeah, I feel that. It's tough out there for you, but... - It is, but... - I'll be on the lookout. - Yeah. - I set up Dante. I can set you up, too. - Yeah, you can set me up, but you gave me some good advice yesterday. You were, like, a couple days ago, you were just, like, don't entertain girls that you don't see yourself with, just wait, figure out how to be content with yourself, become that person that you want to attract, and then it'll, like, God'll bring it in due time, so.</p><p>- And it's easy for me to say now, because I've gone through three years of being single, and there was times where it was really hard, and I really just wanted attention, and would talk to whoever, and then there's, I'm like, first off, time is our most precious commodity.</p><p>Why would I waste my time talking to someone that I know, they're not who I want to end up with, I know it's not going to be a forever thing, like, my time is so precious, and two, that's other people's feelings, and other people's hearts, so you just got to be, like, cool by yourself, and then you'll find someone, someone will come along that adds to that, instead of, like, depending on you, you know what I mean?</p><p>Someone's already there, too, and is cool with themselves. - How tall are you, 6'3"? - Yeah. - Any 6'3" plus dudes out there watching this, you definitely got to, I got to interview you first to make sure that you're worthy, but she's single, and she's a great young gal, so.</p><p>- I'm cutting this out. - Instagram? - I'm cutting this out. - See you there, boy. - I'm cutting this out. - Hit her up. Well, no, hit me up, and then I'll see if you're worthy, and then we'll go from there. - Anyways, great job answering questions. We'll wrap this up.</p><p>- Sounds good. Appreciate you guys for tuning in. We out. (dramatic music)</p></div></div></body></html>
