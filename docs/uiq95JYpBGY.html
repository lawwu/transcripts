You figured it out, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=37" target="_blank">00:00:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Not going great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=39" target="_blank">00:00:39.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Not going great?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=40" target="_blank">00:00:40.460</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. You want to put it in slideshow mode? Oh, it is in slideshow mode? Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=52" target="_blank">00:00:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. Hey, you're showing my IP to the whole audience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=59" target="_blank">00:00:59.240</a></span> | <span class="t">You might ask, is there custom solutions or purchased LLM solutions?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=69" target="_blank">00:01:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, good question. Yeah. How many is custom solutions?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=75" target="_blank">00:01:15.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Interesting. That's maybe 30%? And how many purchased solutions? Wow, way, way less. What are you purchasing?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=88" target="_blank">00:01:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Okay. Well, if you put co-pilot in that category, how many have purchased solutions?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">It's got to be most, right? Interesting. Interesting. Thanks for the... Any more, should we crowdsource some more questions?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=101" target="_blank">00:01:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">No, we can begin. Awesome. All right. So I wanted to talk briefly about our experience with our customers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=109" target="_blank">00:01:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">productionizing Gen AI models. But I want to give you a little bit of context. First of all,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=114" target="_blank">00:01:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">this is clearly preaching to the choir, but it's interesting to see that democratization of AI is here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know. How many people were working in AI 10 years ago?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Nice. 15 years ago?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So yeah, ML totally counts. 100% ML counts. ML definitely counts as a type of AI. Absolutely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I think people talked about the democratization of AI, you know, back when AI was kind of a lame term to use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think we thought that it might take the form of, you know, something like auto ML or more, you know, graphical user interfaces.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But clearly, democratization of AI has happened in a way that we didn't expect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Clearly, through these kind of chat and conversational interfaces and LLMs, we now see AI in literally every company that we talk to in some way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And not just purchasing solutions, although there's, I think probably every company in this room purchases what I would call an AI solution.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">We also see quite a lot of custom solutions, and probably every Fortune 500 right now is investing in custom AI solutions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">More LLMs, more Gen AI, but I would say most also some traditional ML.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's moving into production, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.200</a></span> | <span class="t">You see it in this audience, you see 70% of this audience, but everywhere I go to give a talk, even with companies that you wouldn't necessarily think of as the most forward-thinking,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.040</a></span> | <span class="t">they are starting to have Gen AI applications in production.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So people keep asking me, "When is Gen AI going to move into production?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It really has moved into production, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a lot more that could happen, but Gen AI is in production right now in a lot of applications that you use today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.080</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think the challenge everybody has, and people keep saying it, important to say, AI is so easy to demo and so hard to productionize.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">You see this with a lot of AI apps getting released, there's something about AI that makes CEOs stupid.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.080</a></span> | <span class="t">It makes them stop listening to their customers, it makes them willing to put things into production that are absolutely terrible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think the fundamental reason is that it's so easy to make an incredibly compelling demo.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I get these all the time from my own team, I get them from startups, you know, pitching me on potentially angel investing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.360</a></span> | <span class="t">You can make just an absolutely astonishing demo, and it's so much further from production than we're used to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Even with software, which has this characteristic, AI is so much more easy to demo and so much harder to productionize.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's talk about how to productionize it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll state, I come from Weights and Biases.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.040</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a company I started that I feel very proud of.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.760</a></span> | <span class="t">We've built an AI developer platform that helps develop AI engineers with ML applications or with Gen AI applications.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And we started this company because we saw this massive tools gap for AI ops.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.560</a></span> | <span class="t">We now see that we have three types of customers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.360</a></span> | <span class="t">We see foundation model builders, which we've long served since the beginning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.720</a></span> | <span class="t">We see a bigger group of AI engineers that are doing a blend of ML applications and Gen AI applications.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And we see a new type of audience for our software in software developers that are now getting used to the fact that AI applications are so easy to demo and so hard to productionize and trying to figure out how to productionize those applications.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.800</a></span> | <span class="t">What's exciting for us and exciting for everyone, I think, is that the software developers are so much more numerous than ML engineers and foundation model builders.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Right now that companies can use software developers to do what traditionally would have taken a custom model, it opens us up to do so many more AI applications.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And from our perspective, this is a really exciting development because the market is so much bigger.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's why we see a whole LLM ops tools track at this conference and so many companies popping up to help with this problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I feel really proud, and I always want to say, we work with nearly all the foundation model companies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.760</a></span> | <span class="t">They have special needs, but they do push our scale.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So almost all the LLMs that you would have used, from OpenAS GPT to Mistral to LAMA, these were built using the weights and biases platform.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have years of experience dealing with large scale.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=347" target="_blank">00:05:47.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's also important to say almost all of our customers, and we have thousands of customers, are not foundation model builders.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=353" target="_blank">00:05:53.560</a></span> | <span class="t">They're companies in nearly every industry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=355" target="_blank">00:05:55.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And the really fun part about being in the AI space right now is that there's applications to every industry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=361" target="_blank">00:06:01.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So we see healthcare, we see ag tech, we see manufacturing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=364" target="_blank">00:06:04.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I remember when I came out of school and wanted to get into the AI industry, it was really kind of ranking search results or going to Wall Street or targeting ads.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=372" target="_blank">00:06:12.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Which aren't the most exciting applications now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=374" target="_blank">00:06:14.760</a></span> | <span class="t">It's things that you can touch and feel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It's things that you can explain to your parents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=377" target="_blank">00:06:17.880</a></span> | <span class="t">This is an incredibly exciting development.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=379" target="_blank">00:06:19.640</a></span> | <span class="t">But what makes this hard?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=382" target="_blank">00:06:22.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And I've thought a lot about this, what makes it hard?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And what makes kind of AI engineering a different type of process with a different set of tools needed?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Because every software company has now launched an AI tool version of itself, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=395" target="_blank">00:06:35.800</a></span> | <span class="t">They call me up every day and they say, you know, what do you think?</span></div><div

we're launching AI version of CICD, we're launching AI version of, you know, code versioning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=406"

And it's really interesting. I mean, Alexa is an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=587" target="_blank">00:09:47.720</a></span> | <span class="t">interesting product. I really love it. My daughter is kind of connected to it, talks to her a lot, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=593" target="_blank">00:09:53.400</a></span> | <span class="t">she was really kind of shocked when she asked Alexa to play her favorite song. And Alexa didn't know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=597" target="_blank">00:09:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">what her favorite song is, because she asked Alexa to play Baby Shark literally five times a day. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=601" target="_blank">00:10:01.640</a></span> | <span class="t">it's like there's no data science needed to know what the favorite song is, but Alexa didn't know this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=608" target="_blank">00:10:08.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think there's kind of data privacy reasons that Alexa doesn't keep this, but it's kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=611" target="_blank">00:10:11.400</a></span> | <span class="t">remarkable with all these amazing applications out there to see Alexa not able to do it. And so my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=615" target="_blank">00:10:15.880</a></span> | <span class="t">daughter is asking me, "Hey, could you build an Alexa?" And I was like, "I think maybe I could,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=619" target="_blank">00:10:19.880</a></span> | <span class="t">actually, with LLMs today." So I kind of looked around with the open source Alexa alternatives,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=624" target="_blank">00:10:24.440</a></span> | <span class="t">where there's something called Mycroft that's out there, but kind of out of date, doesn't really use LLMs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=630" target="_blank">00:10:30.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And then my neighbor actually was showing me that he got a seven billion model, I think Llama 2,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=636" target="_blank">00:10:36.840</a></span> | <span class="t">running on a rock pile, which is like a $200 device, similar price to Alexa. So I thought, "Okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=641" target="_blank">00:10:41.240</a></span> | <span class="t">if you have that, maybe we could build an architecture that would kind of do the things that Alexa does."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=646" target="_blank">00:10:46.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So built a library of skills, things that we asked Alexa to do, like play music, ask what the weather is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=653" target="_blank">00:10:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">do math problems, check the news, things like that. And these skills are really simple, right? So, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=658" target="_blank">00:10:58.360</a></span> | <span class="t">like getting what the weather is, it's like a five line thing that actually Copilot can generate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=663" target="_blank">00:11:03.400</a></span> | <span class="t">instantly and works phenomenally well. There's APIs here. The challenge is actually understanding the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=668" target="_blank">00:11:08.360</a></span> | <span class="t">speech, and then getting the natural language into an API call. So kind of a simple architecture here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=674" target="_blank">00:11:14.520</a></span> | <span class="t">right? So the weather comes in, you ask what's weather in Boston, it goes through an on-device LLM to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=678" target="_blank">00:11:18.680</a></span> | <span class="t">translate it to kind of Python looking code that says weather location equals Boston, has to look like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=683" target="_blank">00:11:23.560</a></span> | <span class="t">that because it's going to call that function on the weather skill that I wrote that it calls a weather</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=688" target="_blank">00:11:28.520</a></span> | <span class="t">API. You know, I think Llama and Whisper is a fantastic open source stack here. Llama CPP is one of the many</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=696" target="_blank">00:11:36.120</a></span> | <span class="t">many options to run Llama on cheap hardware. There's VLM and others, and lots of companies that'll do it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=702" target="_blank">00:11:42.200</a></span> | <span class="t">for you. I kind of wanted to do it myself, so Llama CPP was a great choice. And you can run large LLMs on a MacBook in real time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=713" target="_blank">00:11:53.240</a></span> | <span class="t">We've got to skip the demo so much of the audio is working. What you will, if you actually do try</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=719" target="_blank">00:11:59.240</a></span> | <span class="t">to do this yourselves, and a lot of our customers do try to do this themselves and they discover the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=722" target="_blank">00:12:02.360</a></span> | <span class="t">same thing, latency really matters a lot, right? Because you're actually transcribing audio,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=727" target="_blank">00:12:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and then you're running the transcription through an LLM to make this function call. And so if that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=733" target="_blank">00:12:13.320</a></span> | <span class="t">takes longer than a couple hundred milliseconds, it's incredibly painful. So you need to go kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=737" target="_blank">00:12:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">small model here, and you need to run it fast on hardware. So that's why we went with Llama 2 at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=743" target="_blank">00:12:23.080</a></span> | <span class="t">time, and put it in a default prompt, and it didn't work. Zero percent accuracy. And so every kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=748" target="_blank">00:12:28.920</a></span> | <span class="t">customer goes through this journey to try to improve the accuracy, or whatever the real kind of user</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=753" target="_blank">00:12:33.240</a></span> | <span class="t">facing metric is. I'll tell you briefly about my journey to improve this. The first thing I did was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=758" target="_blank">00:12:38.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I did some prompt engineering, just kind of common sense, make the prompt better, kind of lay out what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=763" target="_blank">00:12:43.480</a></span> | <span class="t">functions are available. The model kind of gets closer, and now it's saying call: whether location</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=769" target="_blank">00:12:49.240</a></span> | <span class="t">equals Boston, but still actually not in any kind of format that I can run. Here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=772" target="_blank">00:12:52.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I need really exact accuracy because I'm generating code function calls. This is Llama 2 chat. There's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=780" target="_blank">00:13:00.040</a></span> | <span class="t">so many models to try these days. Llama 2 chat was trained on conversations, performed better in this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=785" target="_blank">00:13:05.800</a></span> | <span class="t">case, and got the accuracy up to 11 percent. Still not possible to ship this, but I kind of looked at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=792" target="_blank">00:13:12.600</a></span> | <span class="t">errors it was making. Looking at the errors, incorporating feedback, got the accuracy up to 75 percent. So pretty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=797" target="_blank">00:13:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">satisfying, pretty iterative process, probably typical to what you're doing or what your engineers are doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=803" target="_blank">00:13:23.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Now it's kind of a cool demo. My daughter is like mildly impressed if she says the the thing just right,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=808" target="_blank">00:13:28.920</a></span> | <span class="t">but actually 75 percent accuracy is incredibly annoying. It's still not going to work well. Switched to Mistral.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=818" target="_blank">00:13:38.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Mistral came out mid-project here, and Mistral's model for free, exact same API to Llama 2, got the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=825" target="_blank">00:13:45.400</a></span> | <span class="t">accuracy up to 79 percent. So this is sort of happening in real time, probably happening to you also. If you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=830" target="_blank">00:13:50.040</a></span> | <span class="t">ready to switch the models quickly, you can get free accuracy improvements as new models come out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=835" target="_blank">00:13:55.080</a></span> | <span class="t">77 percent accuracy is still really annoying, trust me. So I thought, okay, I need to improve this. Still</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=843" target="_blank">00:14:03.320</a></span> | <span class="t">not impressing my daughter. And so I thought, okay, let's try some fine-tuning. And now, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=848" target="_blank">00:14:08.760</a></span> | <span class="t">fine-tuning used to be a hard thing to do, especially on these really large models. Laura, Q Laura has made</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=854" target="_blank">00:14:14.280</a></span> | <span class="t">this a lot more tractable. Now there's probably 20 companies here that actually do this for you for super cheap.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=860" target="_blank">00:14:20.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, no excuse for not fine-tuning once you get to a point where you want to make that kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=865" target="_blank">00:14:25.240</a></span> | <span class="t">of last improvement of accuracy. I was able to run Q Laura on my GPU in my basement. This runs on kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=871" target="_blank">00:14:31.480</a></span> | <span class="t">of standard hardware. I think it's a 4080. And ran a data set in a few hours. But you need the data set.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=879" target="_blank">00:14:39.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So I manually created a couple examples here. You know, using a larger model, in this case ChatGPT,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=883" target="_blank">00:14:43.960</a></span> | <span class="t">to create more examples worked phenomenally well. I think 95 percent of them were good. You know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=887" target="_blank">00:14:47.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I kind of went through by hand and filtered some out. But that, you know, in 15 minutes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=892" target="_blank">00:14:52.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I have a couple thousand examples to fine-tune on. I gave it a schema to format the answer in. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=900" target="_blank">00:15:00.520</a></span> | <span class="t">once it saw more examples, it was actually able to generate more interesting examples kind of from that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=906" target="_blank">00:15:06.040</a></span> | <span class="t">data set. Fine-tuning plus Mistral actually led to 98 percent accuracy. So this is a super satisfying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=912" target="_blank">00:15:12.520</a></span> | <span class="t">project. 98 percent accuracy actually starts to feel like, hey, maybe we could ship this thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=916" target="_blank">00:15:16.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And as a surprising byproduct, it actually worked for other languages. So I was using</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=922" target="_blank">00:15:22.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Whisper model that works really well in other languages.

But the LMs also work in other languages. So we've kind of built this amazing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=933" target="_blank">00:15:33.880</a></span> | <span class="t">multilingual Alexa as kind of a fun side project. Which, by the way, I think is exciting because I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=939" target="_blank">00:15:39.320</a></span> | <span class="t">there was a time when these models got really big. And there's always been kind of a vibrant hacker</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=943" target="_blank">00:15:43.880</a></span> | <span class="t">culture, I think, in AI. But started to wonder if you could only do really expensive projects to get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=949" target="_blank">00:15:49.240</a></span> | <span class="t">anything interesting done.

And the lessons learned stepping back are exactly the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=963" target="_blank">00:16:03.080</a></span> | <span class="t">things that our customers are discovering. It's exactly the things that you're probably discovering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=966" target="_blank">00:16:06.600</a></span> | <span class="t">prompt engineering works really well, especially when you start with a terrible prompt.

People often talk about, hey, should I be using</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=975" target="_blank">00:16:15.720</a></span> | <span class="t">RAG? Should I be using fine tuning? Should I be using prompt engineering? I think almost always in the end,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=979" target="_blank">00:16:19.880</a></span> | <span class="t">to get something shipped into production and working well, you end up using a whole bunch of these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=984" target="_blank">00:16:24.440</a></span> | <span class="t">different methods. Everything is making iterative improvement. Gradually, we get to the accuracy that we need.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=991" target="_blank">00:16:31.720</a></span> | <span class="t">The other thing that I kind of hid from you in this project is this did take me a couple weeks to get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=996" target="_blank">00:16:36.280</a></span> | <span class="t">done. And most experiments didn't work. So in the real world, if I gave this to a colleague and they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=1002" target="_blank">00:16:42.200</a></span> | <span class="t">tried to iterate on top of it, if they just saw this talk here, they wouldn't realize all the things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=1009" target="_blank">00:16:49.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that I tried that failed.

And so we actually kept track in 1DB of all the failures</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=1020" target="_blank">00:17:00.600</a></span> | <span class="t">or experiments.

But I think this is generally best</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=1023" target="_blank">00:17:03.960</a></span> | <span class="t">practice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=1028" target="_blank">00:17:08.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So what are the lessons?

What are the kind of broader lessons? Besides using weights and biases, which you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=1039" target="_blank">00:17:19.960</a></span> | <span class="t">obviously are already doing. And I think that there's kind of four things that we see our customers do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=1048" target="_blank">00:17:28.760</a></span> | <span class="t">where they actually get things into production, they actually make them successful. The first is that they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=1054" target="_blank">00:17:34.280</a></span> | <span class="t">build an evaluation framework and they take this really seriously. We've had people, I do a podcast</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=1059" target="_blank">00:17:39.480</a></span> | <span class="t">called Gradient Descent where I talk to a lot of people. And one prominent CEO of a well-known company</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=1065" target="_blank">00:17:45.400</a></span> | <span class="t">came on the podcast and I asked him, you know, how do you do testing? How do you test your Gen.AI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=1069" target="_blank">00:17:49.880</a></span> | <span class="t">applications in production?

And I think that there actually is a kind of a value to testing by vibes. Like, I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=1090" target="_blank">00:18:10.920</a></span> | <span class="t">if more CEOs tested by vibes, you might actually not have some of the failures that you see. I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=1097" target="_blank">00:18:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">some of these things that get released are so embarrassing that I think a vibes check would have actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=1100" target="_blank">00:18:20.920</a></span> | <span class="t">caused better decision making. But when you're only testing by vibes, the problem is you can't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=1107" target="_blank">00:18:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">release a V2, right? Because what happens is, unlike in software development where you're typically adding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=1111" target="_blank">00:18:31.160</a></span> | <span class="t">features and mostly moving forward, any of these new things that you try are going to make some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=1116" target="_blank">00:18:36.520</a></span> | <span class="t">things better and some things worse. And the vibes check is not going to tell you the difference between</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=1120" target="_blank">00:18:40.520</a></span> | <span class="t">a 75% accuracy and a 79% accuracy. So he never would have been able to make that switch from Llama 2 to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=1125" target="_blank">00:18:45.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Mistral because it just wouldn't have been clear if it's better or worse. And so taking time to build an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=1130" target="_blank">00:18:50.680</a></span> | <span class="t">evaluation framework is really the foundation of getting these things into production and working</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=1136" target="_blank">00:18:56.360</a></span> | <span class="t">well. I actually checked back with that CEO a year later, and he was doing quite a lot of evaluation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=1140" target="_blank">00:19:00.520</a></span> | <span class="t">because he kind of realized that thing where you want to get that second model out and you don't know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=1144" target="_blank">00:19:04.520</a></span> | <span class="t">how to do it. The other thing is starting with a lightweight prototype, we see typically -- this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=1149" target="_blank">00:19:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of an enterprise anti-pattern, but we see it a lot at Weights and Biases where people kind of want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=1153" target="_blank">00:19:13.560</a></span> | <span class="t">build the first step and kind of nail that and then build the second step. And they kind of never get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=1157" target="_blank">00:19:17.480</a></span> | <span class="t">something into the hands of the end user, which might be an internal audience or it might be a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=1161" target="_blank">00:19:21.160</a></span> | <span class="t">customer. I think this is kind of basic agile product development, but somehow people forget</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=1165" target="_blank">00:19:25.880</a></span> | <span class="t">this with Gen AI. So it's worth mentioning because we see this failure mode so frequently. And then,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=1171" target="_blank">00:19:31.320</a></span> | <span class="t">of course, incorporating end user feedback in lots of different ways is critical.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=1174" target="_blank">00:19:34.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And then iterate. So I'll say, you know, evaluation best practices because I think it's such a cornerstone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=1184" target="_blank">00:19:44.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think, well, actually, let me ask you this. How many people in the audience feel like they're doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=1187" target="_blank">00:19:47.960</a></span> | <span class="t">solid evaluations of their Gen AI models? Gen AI applications? Interesting. So a lot less.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=1196" target="_blank">00:19:56.280</a></span> | <span class="t">It seems like you all are not feeling great about your evaluation frameworks. I think what we see,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=1203" target="_blank">00:20:03.160</a></span> | <span class="t">where people kind of end up, is lots of different evaluation sets and techniques. So we see a lot of our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=1210" target="_blank">00:20:10.680</a></span> | <span class="t">customers. We'll do some things like, okay, these are things we can never get wrong. And we want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=1214" target="_blank">00:20:14.040</a></span> | <span class="t">have like a hundred percent in this simple test. And there's lots of tricks to getting that right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=1217" target="_blank">00:20:17.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Then people want to have, you know, something that's sort of very quick to run. So they can,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=1221" target="_blank">00:20:21.640</a></span> | <span class="t">they can kind of run it in real time. They can test something new in 20 or 30 seconds. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=1226" target="_blank">00:20:26.040</a></span> | <span class="t">our customers typically will have much bigger evaluation sets that run nightly and give feedback.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=1231" target="_blank">00:20:31.480</a></span> | <span class="t">That's where people end up.

And we see with, with people that are really in production, like a typical, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=1263" target="_blank">00:21:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">self-driving car company or like a typical bank with a mission-critical application, we see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=1267" target="_blank">00:21:07.560</a></span> | <span class="t">thousands of metrics. We see tens of thousands of metrics. We get requests like, "Hey, can I do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=1271" target="_blank">00:21:11.560</a></span> | <span class="t">regex search across my metrics? Because I have like so many metrics, I can't even, I can't find, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=1277" target="_blank">00:21:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the metrics." And I think that's because you really want to get these metrics working and connected to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=1282" target="_blank">00:21:22.600</a></span> | <span class="t">your user experience. And there's so many different ways that something could fail. But then the most</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=1286" target="_blank">00:21:26.520</a></span> | <span class="t">important thing is actually do it, right? It seems like a lot of people in this room maybe haven't started to do it yet,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=1290" target="_blank">00:21:30.680</a></span> | <span class="t">but doing evaluation is so critical because you can't, you can't improve any of these other things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=1296" target="_blank">00:21:36.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And when people come to me and they ask me questions like, you know, should I be doing fine tuning?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=1300" target="_blank">00:21:40.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Should I be doing RAG? Should I be doing XYZ? What that tells me is they don't have a good evaluation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=1306" target="_blank">00:21:46.840</a></span> | <span class="t">system in place, right? Because it shouldn't take you very long to have an answer for yourself,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=1311" target="_blank">00:21:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">for your own application if one of these techniques works or not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq95JYpBGY&t=1314" target="_blank">00:21:54.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So look, you know, we're here at this conference and this is a lot of fun.
