This is version 5 of this course.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=11" target="_blank">00:00:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's the first year one we've done in two years. So we've got a lot of cool things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=15" target="_blank">00:00:15.560</a></span> | <span class="t">to cover. It's amazing how much has changed. Here is a XKCD from the end of 2015. Who here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=28" target="_blank">00:00:28.520</a></span> | <span class="t">has seen XKCD comics before? Pretty much everybody, not surprising. So the basic joke here is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=36" target="_blank">00:00:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll let you read it and then I'll come back to it. So it can be hard to tell what's easy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=54" target="_blank">00:00:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and what's nearly impossible. And in 2015 or at the end of 2015, the idea of checking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=58" target="_blank">00:00:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">whether something is a photo of a bird was considered nearly impossible. So impossible</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=63" target="_blank">00:01:03.320</a></span> | <span class="t">it was the basic idea of a joke because everybody knows that that's nearly impossible. We're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=68" target="_blank">00:01:08.680</a></span> | <span class="t">now going to build exactly that system for free in about two minutes. So let's build</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=75" target="_blank">00:01:15.880</a></span> | <span class="t">an is-it-a-bird system. So we're going to use Python. And so I'm going to run through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=82" target="_blank">00:01:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">this really quickly. You're not expected to run through it with me because we're going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=85" target="_blank">00:01:25.900</a></span> | <span class="t">to come back to it. OK. But let's go ahead and run that cell. OK. So what we're doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">is we're searching DuckDuckGo for images of bird photos and we're just going to grab one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so here is the URL of the bird that we grabbed. OK. We'll download it. OK. So there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.880</a></span> | <span class="t">it is. So we've grabbed a bird and so OK. We've now got something that can download</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=118" target="_blank">00:01:58.280</a></span> | <span class="t">pictures of birds. Now we're going to need to build a system that can recognize things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that are birds versus things that aren't birds from photos. Now of course computers need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.680</a></span> | <span class="t">numbers to work with. But luckily images are made of numbers. I actually found this really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=138" target="_blank">00:02:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">nice website called PickSpy where I can grab a bird. And if I go over it, let's pick its</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">beak. You'll see here that that part of the beak was 251 brightness of red, 48 of green</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and 21 of blue. So that's GB. And so you can see as I wave around those colors are changing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">those numbers. And so this picture, the thing that we recognize as a picture, is actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.300</a></span> | <span class="t">256 by 171 by 3 numbers between 0 and 255 representing the amount of red, green and blue</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.240</a></span> | <span class="t">on each pixel. So that's going to be an input to our program that's going to try and figure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.420</a></span> | <span class="t">out whether this is a picture of a bird or not. OK. So let's go ahead and run this cell.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Which is going to go through, and I needed bird and non-bird, but you can't really search</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Google images or dot dot go images for not a bird. This doesn't work that way. So I just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">decided to use forest. I thought, OK, pictures of forest versus pictures of bird sounds like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.960</a></span> | <span class="t">a good starting point. So I go through each of forest and bird and I search for forest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">photo and bird photo, download images and then resize them to be no bigger than 400</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">pixels on a side, just because we don't need particularly big ones. It takes a surprisingly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">large amount of time just for a computer to open an image. OK, so we've now got 200 of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.720</a></span> | <span class="t">each. I find when I download images, I often get a few broken ones. And if you try and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">train a model with broken images, it will not work. So here's something which just verifies</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.040</a></span> | <span class="t">each image and unlinks, so deletes the ones that don't work. OK, so now we can create</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">what's called a data block. So after I run this cell, you'll see that basically I go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">through the details of this later, but a data block gives fast AI, the library, all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.280</a></span> | <span class="t">information it needs to create a computer vision model. And so in this case, we're basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.560</a></span> | <span class="t">telling it get all the image files that we just downloaded. And then we say show me a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">few up to six. And let's see. Yeah, so we've got some birds, forest, bird, bird, forest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.800</a></span> | <span class="t">OK, so one of the nice things about doing computer vision models is it's really easy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">to check your data because you can just look at it, which is not the case for a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.960</a></span> | <span class="t">kinds of models. OK, so we've now downloaded 200 pictures of birds, 200 pictures of forests.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=316" target="_blank">00:05:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So we'll now press run. And this model is actually running on my laptop. So it's not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">using a vast data center. It's running on my presentation laptop and it's doing it at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=329" target="_blank">00:05:29.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the same time as my laptop is streaming video, which is possibly a bad idea. And so what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=338" target="_blank">00:05:38.440</a></span> | <span class="t">it's going to do is it's going to run through every photo out of those 400. And for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=345" target="_blank">00:05:45.400</a></span> | <span class="t">ones that are forest, it's going to learn a bit more about what forest looks like. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.760</a></span> | <span class="t">for the ones that are bird, it'll learn a bit more about what bird looks like. So overall,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.580</a></span> | <span class="t">it took under 30 seconds. And believe it or not, that's enough to finish doing the thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">which was in that XKCD comic. Let's check by passing in that bird that we downloaded</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=371" target="_blank">00:06:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">at the start.

For example, where we show you a whole game</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=991" target="_blank">00:16:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">of sports, we show you how much fun it is.

So this, you know, this course is really widely used in industry</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1334" target="_blank">00:22:14.600</a></span> | <span class="t">and research for people. And they have a lot of success. Okay, so there's a bit of brief</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1340" target="_blank">00:22:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">information about why you should hopefully get going with this. Alright, so let's get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1347" target="_blank">00:22:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">back to what's what's happened here. Why are we able to create a bird recognizer in a minute</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1354" target="_blank">00:22:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">or two? And why couldn't we do it before? So I'm going to go back to 2012. And in 2012,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1363" target="_blank">00:22:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">this was how image recognition was done.

It was a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1371" target="_blank">00:22:51.240</a></span> | <span class="t">project done at Stanford, very successful, very famous project that was looking at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1375" target="_blank">00:22:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">five year survival of breast cancer patients by looking at their histopathology images</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1383" target="_blank">00:23:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">slides. Now, so this is like what I would call a classic machine learning approach.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1389" target="_blank">00:23:09.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And I spoke to the senior author of this Daphne Coller. And I asked her why they didn't use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1394" target="_blank">00:23:14.440</a></span> | <span class="t">deep learning. And she said, Well, it just, you know, it wasn't really on the radar at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1398" target="_blank">00:23:18.680</a></span> | <span class="t">that point. So this is like a pre deep learning approach. And so the way they did this was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1404" target="_blank">00:23:24.920</a></span> | <span class="t">they got a big team of mathematicians and computer scientists and pathologists and so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1409" target="_blank">00:23:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">forth to get together and build these ideas for features like relationships between epithelial</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1414" target="_blank">00:23:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">nuclear neighbors. Thousands and thousands, actually, they created a features and each</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1418" target="_blank">00:23:38.760</a></span> | <span class="t">one required a lot of expertise from a cross disciplinary group of experts at Stanford.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1424" target="_blank">00:23:44.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So this project took years, and a lot of people and a lot of code and a lot of math. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1430" target="_blank">00:23:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">once they had all these features, they then fed them into a machine learning model, in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1434" target="_blank">00:23:54.360</a></span> | <span class="t">this case, logistic regression to predict survival. As I say, it's very successful, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1440" target="_blank">00:24:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's not something that I could create for you in a minute, at the start of a course.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1447" target="_blank">00:24:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">The difference with neural networks is neural networks don't require us to build these features.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1451" target="_blank">00:24:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">They build them for us. And so what actually happened was, in I think it was 2015, Matt</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1459" target="_blank">00:24:19.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Zyla and Rob Fergus took a trained neural network and they looked inside it to see what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1466" target="_blank">00:24:26.920</a></span> | <span class="t">it had learned. So we don't give it features, we ask it to learn features. So when Zyla</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1474" target="_blank">00:24:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and Fergus looked inside a neural network, they looked at the actual, the weights in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1481" target="_blank">00:24:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the model, and they draw a picture of them. And this was nine of the sets of weights they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1485" target="_blank">00:24:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">found. And this set of weights, for example, finds diagonal edges. This set of weights</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1491" target="_blank">00:24:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">finds yellow to blue gradients. And this set of weights finds red to green gradients and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1497" target="_blank">00:24:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">so forth, right? And then down here are examples of some bits of photos which closely matched,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1504" target="_blank">00:25:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">for example, this feature detector. And deep learning is deep because we can then take</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1513" target="_blank">00:25:13.480</a></span> | <span class="t">these features and combine them to create more advanced features. So these are some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1519" target="_blank">00:25:19.360</a></span> | <span class="t">layer two features. So there's a feature, for example, that finds corners and a feature</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1524" target="_blank">00:25:24.540</a></span> | <span class="t">that finds curves and a feature that finds circles. And here are some examples of bits</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1529" target="_blank">00:25:29.140</a></span> | <span class="t">of pictures that the circle finder found. And so remember, with a neural net, which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1535" target="_blank">00:25:35.720</a></span> | <span class="t">is the basic function used in deep learning, we don't have to hand code any of these or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1541" target="_blank">00:25:41.060</a></span> | <span class="t">come up with any of these ideas. You just start with actually a random neural network,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1547" target="_blank">00:25:47.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and you feed it examples, and you have a learn to recognize things. And it turns out that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1554" target="_blank">00:25:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">these are the things that it creates for itself. So you can then combine these features. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1563" target="_blank">00:26:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">when you combine these features, it creates a feature detector, for example, that finds</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1567" target="_blank">00:26:07.880</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of repeating geometric shapes. And it creates a feature detector, for example, that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1574" target="_blank">00:26:14.440</a></span> | <span class="t">finds kind of really little things, which it looks like is finding the edges of flowers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1580" target="_blank">00:26:20.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And this feature detector here seems to be finding words. And so the deeper you get,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1588" target="_blank">00:26:28.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the more sophisticated the features it can find are. And so you can imagine that trying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1592" target="_blank">00:26:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to code these things by hand would be insanely difficult, and you wouldn't know even what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1598" target="_blank">00:26:38.680</a></span> | <span class="t">to encode by hand. So what we're going to learn is how neural networks do this automatically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1605" target="_blank">00:26:45.520</a></span> | <span class="t">But this is the key difference of why we can now do things that previously we just didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1611" target="_blank">00:26:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">even conceive of as possible, because now we don't have to hand code the features we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1616" target="_blank">00:26:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">look for. They can all be learned. Now, build is important to recognize. We're going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1626" target="_blank">00:27:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">be spending some time learning about building image-based algorithms. And image-based algorithms</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1634" target="_blank">00:27:14.280</a></span> | <span class="t">are not just for images. And in fact, this is going to be a general theme. We're going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1637" target="_blank">00:27:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">to show you some foundational techniques. But with creativity, these foundational techniques</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1643" target="_blank">00:27:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">can be used very widely. So for example, an image recognizer can also be used to classify</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1654" target="_blank">00:27:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">sounds. So this was an example from one of our students who posted on the forum and said</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1661" target="_blank">00:27:41.160</a></span> | <span class="t">for their project, they would try classifying sounds. And so they basically took sounds</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1667" target="_blank">00:27:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and created pictures from their waveforms. And then they used an image recognizer on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1672" target="_blank">00:27:52.200</a></span> | <span class="t">that. And they got a state of the art result, by the way. Another of our students on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1677" target="_blank">00:27:57.320</a></span> | <span class="t">forum said that they did something very similar to take time series and turn them into pictures</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1683" target="_blank">00:28:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and then use image classifiers. Another of our students created pictures from mouse movements</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1692" target="_blank">00:28:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">from users of a computer system. So the clicks became dots and the movements became lines</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1697" target="_blank">00:28:17.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and the speed of the movement became colors. And then use that to create an image classifier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1703" target="_blank">00:28:23.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can see with some creativity, there's a lot of things you can do with images. There's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1713" target="_blank">00:28:33.880</a></span> | <span class="t">something else I wanted to point out, which is that as you saw, when we trained a real</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1721" target="_blank">00:28:41.720</a></span> | <span class="t">working bird-recognized image model, we didn't need lots of math. There wasn't any. We didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1728" target="_blank">00:28:48.200</a></span> | <span class="t">need lots of data. We had 200 pictures. We didn't need lots of expensive computers. We</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1732" target="_blank">00:28:52.680</a></span> | <span class="t">just used my laptop. This is generally the case for the vast majority of deep learning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1739" target="_blank">00:28:59.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that you'll need in real life. There will be some math that pops up during this course,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1749" target="_blank">00:29:09.560</a></span> | <span class="t">but we will teach it to you as needed or we'll refer you to external resources as needed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1754" target="_blank">00:29:14.040</a></span> | <span class="t">But it will just be the little bits that you actually need. The myth that deep learning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1760" target="_blank">00:29:20.600</a></span> | <span class="t">needs lots of data I think is mainly passed along by big companies that want to sell you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1767" target="_blank">00:29:27.480</a></span> | <span class="t">computers to store lots of data and to process it.

And as you'll see, there's actually a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1780" target="_blank">00:29:40.760</a></span> | <span class="t">lot of fantastic places you can do state-of-the-art work for free nowadays, which is great news.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1791" target="_blank">00:29:51.080</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the key reasons for this is because of something called transfer learning, which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1795" target="_blank">00:29:55.080</a></span> | <span class="t">we'll be learning about a lot during this course, and it's something which very few</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1800" target="_blank">00:30:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">people are aware of and are aware of. In this course, we'll be using PyTorch.

And in research</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1834" target="_blank">00:30:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">repositories amongst the top papers, TensorFlow is a tiny minority now compared to PyTorch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1844" target="_blank">00:30:44.780</a></span> | <span class="t">This is also great research that's come out from Ryan O'Connor. He also discovered that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1852" target="_blank">00:30:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the majority of people that were doing TensorFlow in 2018, the majority of now shifted to PyTorch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1860" target="_blank">00:31:00.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And I mention this because what people use in research is a very strong leading indicator</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1866" target="_blank">00:31:06.600</a></span> | <span class="t">of what's going to happen in industry because this is where all the new algorithms are going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1870" target="_blank">00:31:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">to come out, this is where all the papers are going to be written about. It's going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1874" target="_blank">00:31:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to be increasingly difficult to use TensorFlow. We've been using PyTorch since before it came</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1880" target="_blank">00:31:20.600</a></span> | <span class="t">out, before the initial release, because we knew just from technical fundamentals, it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1885" target="_blank">00:31:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">was far better. So this course has been using PyTorch for a long time. I will say, however,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1892" target="_blank">00:31:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that PyTorch requires a lot of hairy code for relatively simple things.

I actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1903" target="_blank">00:31:43.740</a></span> | <span class="t">copied this code from the PyTorch repository. So as you can see, there's a lot of it. This</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1911" target="_blank">00:31:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">gray bit here is the code required to do the same thing with FastAI. FastAI is a library</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1919" target="_blank">00:31:59.120</a></span> | <span class="t">we built on top of PyTorch. This huge difference is not because PyTorch is bad, it's because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1926" target="_blank">00:32:06.520</a></span> | <span class="t">PyTorch is designed to be a strong foundation to build things on top of, like FastAI.

The problem</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1949" target="_blank">00:32:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">of writing lots of code is that that's lots of things to make mistakes with, lots of things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1953" target="_blank">00:32:33.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to not have best practices in, lots of things to maintain. In general, we found particularly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=1959" target="_blank">00:32:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">with deep learning, less code is better.

Nowadays, I would say most people, at least most students, run Jupyter Notebooks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2077" target="_blank">00:34:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">not on their own computers, particularly for data science, but on a cloud server, of which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2084" target="_blank">00:34:44.220</a></span> | <span class="t">there's quite a few. And as I mentioned earlier, if you go to course.fast.ai, you can see how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2092" target="_blank">00:34:52.100</a></span> | <span class="t">to use various different cloud servers. One I'm going to show an example of is Kaggle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2105" target="_blank">00:35:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So Kaggle doesn't just have competitions, but it also has a cloud notebooks server.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2110" target="_blank">00:35:10.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And I've got quite a few examples there. So let me give you a quick example of how we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2121" target="_blank">00:35:21.340</a></span> | <span class="t">use Jupyter Notebooks to build stuff, to experiment, to explore. So on Kaggle, if you start with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2130" target="_blank">00:35:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">somebody else's Notebook, so why don't you start with this one, Jupyter Notebook 101.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2135" target="_blank">00:35:35.700</a></span> | <span class="t">If it's your own Notebook, you'll see a button called edit.

If you use somebody's Notebook that you like, make sure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2145" target="_blank">00:35:45.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you click the upvote button to encourage them and to help other people find it before you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2149" target="_blank">00:35:49.720</a></span> | <span class="t">go ahead and copy and edit. And once we're in edit mode, we can now use this Notebook.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2159" target="_blank">00:35:59.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And to use it, we can type in any arbitrary expression in Python and click run. And the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2166" target="_blank">00:36:06.260</a></span> | <span class="t">very first time we do that, it says session is starting. It's basically launching a virtual</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2170" target="_blank">00:36:10.460</a></span> | <span class="t">computer for us to run our code. This is all free. In a sense, it's like the world's most</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2178" target="_blank">00:36:18.420</a></span> | <span class="t">powerful calculator. It's a calculator where you have all of the capabilities of the world's,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2185" target="_blank">00:36:25.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I think, most popular programming language. Certainly, it and JavaScript would be the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2189" target="_blank">00:36:29.260</a></span> | <span class="t">top two directly at your disposal. So Python does know how to do one plus one. And so you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2195" target="_blank">00:36:35.400</a></span> | <span class="t">can see here, it spits out the answer. I hate clicking. I always use keyboard shortcuts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2200" target="_blank">00:36:40.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So instead of clicking this little arrow, you just press shift and to do the same thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2206" target="_blank">00:36:46.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And as you can see, there's not just calculations here. There's also pros. And so Jupyter Notebooks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2213" target="_blank">00:36:53.420</a></span> | <span class="t">are great for explaining to you the version of yourself in six months time, what on earth</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2219" target="_blank">00:36:59.180</a></span> | <span class="t">you are doing or to your coworkers or to people in the open source community, what are people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2223" target="_blank">00:37:03.460</a></span> | <span class="t">you're blogging for, etc. And so you just type pros. And as you can see, when we create</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2229" target="_blank">00:37:09.820</a></span> | <span class="t">a new cell, you can create a code cell, which is a cell that lets you type calculations</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2236" target="_blank">00:37:16.700</a></span> | <span class="t">or a markdown cell, which is a cell that lets you create pros. And the pros use this formatting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2246" target="_blank">00:37:26.340</a></span> | <span class="t">in a little mini language called markdown. There's so many tutorials around, I won't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2250" target="_blank">00:37:30.300</a></span> | <span class="t">explain it to you, but it lets you do things like links and so forth. So I'll let you follow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2261" target="_blank">00:37:41.100</a></span> | <span class="t">through the tutorial in your own time because it really explains to you what to do. One</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2268" target="_blank">00:37:48.220</a></span> | <span class="t">thing to point out is that sometimes you'll see me use cells with an exclamation mark</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2272" target="_blank">00:37:52.060</a></span> | <span class="t">at the start. That's not Python. That's a bash shell command. Okay, so that's what the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2278" target="_blank">00:37:58.260</a></span> | <span class="t">exclamation mark means. As you can see, you can put images into notebooks. And so the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2286" target="_blank">00:38:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">image I popped in here was the one showing that Jupiter won the 2017 software system</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2291" target="_blank">00:38:11.100</a></span> | <span class="t">award, which is pretty much the biggest award there is for this kind of software. Okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2297" target="_blank">00:38:17.420</a></span> | <span class="t">so that's the basic idea of how we use notebooks. So let's have a look at how we do our, how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2308" target="_blank">00:38:28.140</a></span> | <span class="t">we do our bird or not bird model. One thing I always like to do when I'm using something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2318" target="_blank">00:38:38.460</a></span> | <span class="t">like Colab or Kaggle cloud platforms that I'm not controlling is make sure that I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2323" target="_blank">00:38:43.420</a></span> | <span class="t">using the most recent version of any software. So my first cell here is exclamation mark</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2329" target="_blank">00:38:49.620</a></span> | <span class="t">pip install minus U that means upgrade Q for quiet fast AI. So that makes sure that we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2335" target="_blank">00:38:55.420</a></span> | <span class="t">have the latest version of fast AI. And if you always have that at the start of your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2338" target="_blank">00:38:58.940</a></span> | <span class="t">notebooks, you're never going to have those awkward foreign threads where you say, why</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2342" target="_blank">00:39:02.820</a></span> | <span class="t">isn't this working? And somebody says to you, oh, you're using an old version of some software.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2349" target="_blank">00:39:09.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So you'll see here, this notebook is the exact thing that I was showing you at the start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2356" target="_blank">00:39:16.700</a></span> | <span class="t">of this lesson. So if you haven't done much Python, you might be surprised about how little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2371" target="_blank">00:39:31.980</a></span> | <span class="t">code there is here. And so Python is a concise but not too concise language, you'll see that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2381" target="_blank">00:39:41.980</a></span> | <span class="t">there's less boilerplate than some other languages you might be familiar with. And I'm also taking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2387" target="_blank">00:39:47.380</a></span> | <span class="t">advantage of a lot of libraries. So fast AI provides a lot of convenient things for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2394" target="_blank">00:39:54.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So I forgot to import. So to use a external library, we use import to import a symbol</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2409" target="_blank">00:40:09.260</a></span> | <span class="t">from a library. Fast AI has a lot of libraries we provide, they generally start with fast</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2415" target="_blank">00:40:15.100</a></span> | <span class="t">something. So for example, to make it easy to download a URL, fast download has download</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2420" target="_blank">00:40:20.100</a></span> | <span class="t">URL. To make it easy to create a thumbnail, we have image to thumb and so forth. So we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2431" target="_blank">00:40:31.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I always like to view as I'm building a model, my data at every step. So that's why I first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2438" target="_blank">00:40:38.740</a></span> | <span class="t">of all grab one bird, and then I grab one forest photo, and I look at them to make sure they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2445" target="_blank">00:40:45.780</a></span> | <span class="t">look reasonable. And once I think okay, they look okay, then I go ahead and download. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2458" target="_blank">00:40:58.620</a></span> | <span class="t">so you can see fast AI has a download images, where you just provide a list of URLs. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2464" target="_blank">00:41:04.820</a></span> | <span class="t">that's how easy it is. And it does that in parallel. So it does that, you know, surprisingly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2470" target="_blank">00:41:10.740</a></span> | <span class="t">quickly. One other fast AI thing I'm using here is resize images. You generally will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2478" target="_blank">00:41:18.260</a></span> | <span class="t">find that for computer vision algorithms, you don't need particularly big images. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2483" target="_blank">00:41:23.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm resizing these to a maximum side length of 400. Because it's actually much faster.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2490" target="_blank">00:41:30.820</a></span> | <span class="t">This GPUs are so quick for big images, most of the time can be taken up just opening it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2497" target="_blank">00:41:37.740</a></span> | <span class="t">The neural net itself often takes less time. So that's another good reason to make them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2501" target="_blank">00:41:41.980</a></span> | <span class="t">smaller. Okay. So the main thing I wanted to tell you about was this data block command.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2511" target="_blank">00:41:51.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So the data block is the key thing that you're going to want to get familiar with, as deep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2516" target="_blank">00:41:56.660</a></span> | <span class="t">learning practitioners at the start of your journey. Because the main thing you're going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2522" target="_blank">00:42:02.820</a></span> | <span class="t">to be trying to figure out is how do I get this data into my model? Now that might surprise</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2529" target="_blank">00:42:09.340</a></span> | <span class="t">you. You might be thinking we should be spending all of our time talking about neural network</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2533" target="_blank">00:42:13.300</a></span> | <span class="t">architectures and matrix multiplication and gradients and stuff like that. The truth is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2540" target="_blank">00:42:20.780</a></span> | <span class="t">very little of that comes up in practice. And the reason is that at this point, the deep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2548" target="_blank">00:42:28.380</a></span> | <span class="t">learning community has found a reasonably small number of types of model that work for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2556" target="_blank">00:42:36.780</a></span> | <span class="t">nearly all the main applications you'll need. And fast AI will create the right type of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2562" target="_blank">00:42:42.840</a></span> | <span class="t">model for you the vast majority of the time. So all of that stuff about tweaking neural</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2570" target="_blank">00:42:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">network architectures and stuff, I mean, we'll get to it eventually in this course. But you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2576" target="_blank">00:42:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">might be surprised to discover that it almost never comes up. Kind of like if you ever did</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2582" target="_blank">00:43:02.260</a></span> | <span class="t">like a computer science course or something, and they spent all this time on the details</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2586" target="_blank">00:43:06.860</a></span> | <span class="t">of compilers and operating systems, and then you get to the real world and you never use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2590" target="_blank">00:43:10.620</a></span> | <span class="t">it again. So this course is called practical deep learning. And so we're going to focus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2595" target="_blank">00:43:15.340</a></span> | <span class="t">on the stuff that is practically important. Okay, so our images are finished downloading,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2602" target="_blank">00:43:22.740</a></span> | <span class="t">and two of them were broken, so we just deleted them. Another thing you'll note, by the way,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2611" target="_blank">00:43:31.620</a></span> | <span class="t">if you're a keen software engineer is I tend to use a lot of functional style in my programs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2619" target="_blank">00:43:39.340</a></span> | <span class="t">I find for kind of the kind of work I do that a functional style works very well.

So yeah, that's why you'll see me using stuff like map and stuff</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2634" target="_blank">00:43:54.340</a></span> | <span class="t">quite a lot. Alright, so a data block is the key thing you need to know about if you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2641" target="_blank">00:44:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">going to know how to use different kinds of data sets. And so these are all of the things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2646" target="_blank">00:44:06.620</a></span> | <span class="t">basically that you'll be providing. And so what we did when we designed the data block</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2650" target="_blank">00:44:10.900</a></span> | <span class="t">was we actually looked and said, okay, over hundreds of projects, what are all the things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2659" target="_blank">00:44:19.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that change from project to project to get the data into the right shape. And we realized</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2664" target="_blank">00:44:24.340</a></span> | <span class="t">we could basically split it down into these five things. So the first thing that we tell</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2670" target="_blank">00:44:30.460</a></span> | <span class="t">fast AI is what kind of input do we have. And so then so there are lots of blocks in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2676" target="_blank">00:44:36.500</a></span> | <span class="t">fast AI for different kinds of input. So he said, Oh, the input is an image. What kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2681" target="_blank">00:44:41.340</a></span> | <span class="t">of output is there? What kind of label? The outputs are category. So that means it's one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2685" target="_blank">00:44:45.580</a></span> | <span class="t">of a number of possibilities. So that's enough for fast AI to know what kind of model to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2692" target="_blank">00:44:52.980</a></span> | <span class="t">build for you. So what are the items in this model? What am I actually going to be looking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2698" target="_blank">00:44:58.060</a></span> | <span class="t">at to look to train from? This is a function. In fact, you might have noticed if you were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2703" target="_blank">00:45:03.800</a></span> | <span class="t">looking carefully that we use this function here. It's a function which returns a list</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2711" target="_blank">00:45:11.940</a></span> | <span class="t">of all of the image files in a path based on extension. So every time it's going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2717" target="_blank">00:45:17.420</a></span> | <span class="t">try and find out what things to train from, it's going to use that function. In this case,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2721" target="_blank">00:45:21.420</a></span> | <span class="t">we'll get a list of image files. Now, something we'll talk about shortly is that it's critical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2727" target="_blank">00:45:27.780</a></span> | <span class="t">that you put aside some data for testing the accuracy of your model. And that's called</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2732" target="_blank">00:45:32.860</a></span> | <span class="t">a validation set. It's so critical that fast AI won't let you train a model with that one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2739" target="_blank">00:45:39.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So you actually have to tell it how to create a validation set, how to set aside some data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2745" target="_blank">00:45:45.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And in this case, we say randomly set aside 20% of the data. Okay, next question, then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2755" target="_blank">00:45:55.740</a></span> | <span class="t">you have to tell fast AI is how do we know the correct label of a photo? How do we know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2762" target="_blank">00:46:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">if it's a bird photo or a forest photo? And this is another function. And this function</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2769" target="_blank">00:46:09.540</a></span> | <span class="t">simply returns the parent folder of a path. And so in this case, we saved our images into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2780" target="_blank">00:46:20.580</a></span> | <span class="t">either forest or bird. So that's where the labels are going to come from.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2786" target="_blank">00:46:26.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And then finally, most computer vision architectures need all of your inputs as you train to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2795" target="_blank">00:46:35.260</a></span> | <span class="t">the same size. So item transforms are all of the bits of code that are going to run</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2803" target="_blank">00:46:43.100</a></span> | <span class="t">on every item, on every image in this case. And we're saying, okay, we want you to resize</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2809" target="_blank">00:46:49.300</a></span> | <span class="t">each of them to being 192 by 192 pixels. There's two ways you can resize, you can either crop</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2816" target="_blank">00:46:56.580</a></span> | <span class="t">out a piece in the middle, or you can squish it. And so we're saying, squish it. So that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2826" target="_blank">00:47:06.100</a></span> | <span class="t">the data block, that's all that you need. And from there, we create an important class</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2831" target="_blank">00:47:11.660</a></span> | <span class="t">called data loaders. Data loaders are the things that actually PyTorch iterates through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2838" target="_blank">00:47:18.220</a></span> | <span class="t">to grab a bunch of your data at a time. The way it can do it so fast is by using a GPU,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2844" target="_blank">00:47:24.580</a></span> | <span class="t">which is something that can do thousands of things at the same time. And that means it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2848" target="_blank">00:47:28.620</a></span> | <span class="t">needs thousands of things to do at the same time. So a data loader will feed the training</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2854" target="_blank">00:47:34.820</a></span> | <span class="t">algorithm with a bunch of your images at once. In fact, we don't call it a bunch, we call</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2862" target="_blank">00:47:42.220</a></span> | <span class="t">it a batch, or a mini batch. And so when we say show batch, that's actually a very specific</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2873" target="_blank">00:47:53.420</a></span> | <span class="t">word in deep learning, it's saying show me an example of a batch of data that you would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2878" target="_blank">00:47:58.740</a></span> | <span class="t">be passing into the model. And so you can see show batch gives you tells you two things,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2883" target="_blank">00:48:03.860</a></span> | <span class="t">the input, which is the picture, and the label. And remember, the label came by calling that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2891" target="_blank">00:48:11.900</a></span> | <span class="t">function. So when you come to building your own models, you'll be wanting to know what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2900" target="_blank">00:48:20.940</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of splitters are there and what kinds of labeling functions are there and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2904" target="_blank">00:48:24.460</a></span> | <span class="t">That's wrong button. You'll be wanting to know what kind of labeling functions are there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2910" target="_blank">00:48:30.420</a></span> | <span class="t">and what kind of splitters are there and so forth. And so docs.fast.ai is where you go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2915" target="_blank">00:48:35.540</a></span> | <span class="t">to get that information. Often the best place to go is the tutorials. So for example, here's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2923" target="_blank">00:48:43.060</a></span> | <span class="t">a whole data block tutorial. And there's lots and lots of examples. So hopefully you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2928" target="_blank">00:48:48.900</a></span> | <span class="t">start out by finding something that's similar to what you want to do and see how we did</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2934" target="_blank">00:48:54.860</a></span> | <span class="t">it. But then of course, there's also the underlying API information. So here's data blocks. OK.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2947" target="_blank">00:49:07.540</a></span> | <span class="t">How are we doing? Still doing good. All right. So at the end of all this, we've got an object</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2959" target="_blank">00:49:19.380</a></span> | <span class="t">called dls. It stands for data loaders. And that contains iterators that PyTorch can run</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2967" target="_blank">00:49:27.700</a></span> | <span class="t">through to grab batches of randomly split out training images to train the model with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2975" target="_blank">00:49:35.260</a></span> | <span class="t">and validation images to test the model with. So now we need a model. The critical concept</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2983" target="_blank">00:49:43.660</a></span> | <span class="t">here in fast.ai is called a learner. A learner is something which combines a model, that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2990" target="_blank">00:49:50.660</a></span> | <span class="t">is the actual neural network function we'll be training, and the data we use to train</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=2995" target="_blank">00:49:55.220</a></span> | <span class="t">it with. And that's why you have to pass in two things. The data, which is the data loaders</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3001" target="_blank">00:50:01.500</a></span> | <span class="t">object, and a model. And so the model is going to be the actual neural network function that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3011" target="_blank">00:50:11.580</a></span> | <span class="t">you want to pass in. And as I said, there's a relatively small number that basically work</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3016" target="_blank">00:50:16.620</a></span> | <span class="t">for the vast majority of things you do. If you pass in just a bare symbol like this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3024" target="_blank">00:50:24.020</a></span> | <span class="t">it's going to be one of fast.ai's built-in models. But what's particularly interesting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3030" target="_blank">00:50:30.100</a></span> | <span class="t">is that we integrate a wonderful library by Ross Whiteman called Tim, the PyTorch image</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3035" target="_blank">00:50:35.820</a></span> | <span class="t">models, which is the largest collection of computer vision models in the world. And at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3040" target="_blank">00:50:40.580</a></span> | <span class="t">this point, fast.ai is the first and only framework to integrate this. So you can use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3045" target="_blank">00:50:45.540</a></span> | <span class="t">any one of the PyTorch image models. And one of our students, Amanomora, was kind enough</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3051" target="_blank">00:50:51.740</a></span> | <span class="t">to create this fantastic documentation where you can find out all about the different models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3063" target="_blank">00:51:03.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And if we click on here, you can get lots and lots of information about all the different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3068" target="_blank">00:51:08.380</a></span> | <span class="t">models that Ross has provided. Having said that, the model family called ResNet are probably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3079" target="_blank">00:51:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">going to be fine for nearly all the things you want to do. But it is fun to try different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3083" target="_blank">00:51:23.900</a></span> | <span class="t">models out. So you can type in any string here to use any one of those other models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3093" target="_blank">00:51:33.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so if we run that, let's see what happens. Okay, so this is interesting. So when I ran</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3101" target="_blank">00:51:41.820</a></span> | <span class="t">this, so remember on Kaggle, it's creating a new virtual computer for us. So it doesn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3107" target="_blank">00:51:47.980</a></span> | <span class="t">really have anything ready to go. So when I ran this, the first thing it did was it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3111" target="_blank">00:51:51.260</a></span> | <span class="t">said downloading resnet18.pth. What's that? Well, the reason we can do this so fast is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3121" target="_blank">00:52:01.100</a></span> | <span class="t">because somebody else has already trained this model to recognize over 1 million images of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3128" target="_blank">00:52:08.980</a></span> | <span class="t">over 1,000 different types, something called the image net dataset. And they then made</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3136" target="_blank">00:52:16.140</a></span> | <span class="t">those weights available, those parameters available on the internet for anybody to download.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3142" target="_blank">00:52:22.780</a></span> | <span class="t">By default, on fast.ai, when you ask for a model, we will download those weights for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3149" target="_blank">00:52:29.380</a></span> | <span class="t">you so that you don't start with a random network that can't do anything. You actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3154" target="_blank">00:52:34.900</a></span> | <span class="t">start with a network that can do an awful lot. And so then something that fast.ai has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3160" target="_blank">00:52:40.580</a></span> | <span class="t">that's unique is this fine-tune method, which what it does is it takes those pre-trained</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3166" target="_blank">00:52:46.500</a></span> | <span class="t">weights we downloaded for you and it adjusts them in a really carefully controlled way</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3172" target="_blank">00:52:52.660</a></span> | <span class="t">to just teach the model the differences between your dataset and what it was originally trained</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3180" target="_blank">00:53:00.060</a></span> | <span class="t">for. That's called fine-tuning. Hence the name. So that's why you'll see this downloading</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3187" target="_blank">00:53:07.500</a></span> | <span class="t">happen first. And so as you can see at the end of it, this is the error rate here. After</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3193" target="_blank">00:53:13.980</a></span> | <span class="t">a few seconds, it's 100% accurate. So we now have a learner. And this learner has started</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3206" target="_blank">00:53:26.140</a></span> | <span class="t">with a pre-trained model. It's been fine-tuned for the purpose of recognizing bird pictures</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3212" target="_blank">00:53:32.220</a></span> | <span class="t">from forest pictures. So you can now call .predict on it. And .predict, you pass in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3223" target="_blank">00:53:43.140</a></span> | <span class="t">an image. And so this is how you would then deploy your model. So in the code, you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3231" target="_blank">00:53:51.020</a></span> | <span class="t">whatever it needs to do. So in this particular case, this person had some reason that he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3239" target="_blank">00:53:59.300</a></span> | <span class="t">needs the app to check whether they're in a national park and whether it's a photo of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3243" target="_blank">00:54:03.220</a></span> | <span class="t">a bird. So at the bit where they need to know if it's a photo of a bird, it would just call</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3248" target="_blank">00:54:08.380</a></span> | <span class="t">this one line of code, learn.predict. And so that's going to return whether it's a bird</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3255" target="_blank">00:54:15.660</a></span> | <span class="t">or not as a string, whether it's a bird or not as an integer, and the probability that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3260" target="_blank">00:54:20.780</a></span> | <span class="t">it's a non-bird or a bird. And so that's why we can print these things out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3269" target="_blank">00:54:29.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's how we can create a computer vision model. What about other kinds of models? There's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3279" target="_blank">00:54:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot more in the world than just computer vision, a lot more than just image recognition.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3285" target="_blank">00:54:45.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Or even within computer vision, there's a lot more than just image recognition. For</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3291" target="_blank">00:54:51.220</a></span> | <span class="t">example, there's segmentation. So segmentation, maybe the best way to explain segmentation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3305" target="_blank">00:55:05.940</a></span> | <span class="t">is to show you the result of this model. Segmentation is where we take photos, in this case of road</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3314" target="_blank">00:55:14.700</a></span> | <span class="t">scenes, and we color in every pixel according to what is it. So in this case, we've got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3322" target="_blank">00:55:22.300</a></span> | <span class="t">brown as cars, blue as fences, I guess, red as buildings, brown. And so on the left here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3332" target="_blank">00:55:32.780</a></span> | <span class="t">some photos that somebody has already gone through and classified every pixel of every</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3338" target="_blank">00:55:38.060</a></span> | <span class="t">one of these images according to what that pixel is a pixel of. And then on the right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3345" target="_blank">00:55:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">is what our model is guessing. And as you can see, it's getting a lot of the pixels</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3352" target="_blank">00:55:52.580</a></span> | <span class="t">correct, and some of them is getting wrong. It's actually amazing how many is getting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3358" target="_blank">00:55:58.900</a></span> | <span class="t">correct because this particular model I trained in about 20 seconds using a tiny, tiny, tiny</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3375" target="_blank">00:56:15.260</a></span> | <span class="t">amount of data. So again, you would think this would be a particularly challenging problem</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3382" target="_blank">00:56:22.300</a></span> | <span class="t">to solve, but it took about 20 seconds of training to solve it not amazingly well, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3389" target="_blank">00:56:29.260</a></span> | <span class="t">pretty well. If I'd trained it for another two minutes, it'd probably be close to perfect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3394" target="_blank">00:56:34.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is called segmentation. Now, you'll see that there's very, very little code required,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3405" target="_blank">00:56:45.860</a></span> | <span class="t">and the steps are actually going to look quite familiar. In fact, in this case, we're using</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3410" target="_blank">00:56:50.460</a></span> | <span class="t">an even simpler approach. Now, earlier on, we used data blocks. Data blocks are a kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3416" target="_blank">00:56:56.940</a></span> | <span class="t">of intermediate level, very flexible approach that you can take to handling almost any kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3425" target="_blank">00:57:05.740</a></span> | <span class="t">of data. But for the kinds of data that occur a lot, you can use these special data loaders</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3431" target="_blank">00:57:11.500</a></span> | <span class="t">classes, which kind of lets you use even less code. So in this case, to create data loaders</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3437" target="_blank">00:57:17.140</a></span> | <span class="t">for segmentation, you can just say, okay, I'm going to pass you in a function for labeling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3444" target="_blank">00:57:24.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can see here, it's got pretty similar things that we pass in to what we passed in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3449" target="_blank">00:57:29.340</a></span> | <span class="t">for data blocks before. So our file names is getImageFiles again, and then our label</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3455" target="_blank">00:57:35.620</a></span> | <span class="t">function is something that grabs this path and the codes, so the code, so like what does</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3468" target="_blank">00:57:48.820</a></span> | <span class="t">each code mean, is going to be this text file. But you can see the basic information we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3475" target="_blank">00:57:55.340</a></span> | <span class="t">providing is very, very similar, regardless of whether we're doing segmentation or object</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3481" target="_blank">00:58:01.700</a></span> | <span class="t">recognition. And then the next steps are pretty much the same. We create a learner for segmentation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3486" target="_blank">00:58:06.460</a></span> | <span class="t">We create something called a unit learner, which we'll learn about later. And then again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3490" target="_blank">00:58:10.740</a></span> | <span class="t">we call fine-tune. So that is it. And that's how we create a segmentation model. What about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3499" target="_blank">00:58:19.580</a></span> | <span class="t">stepping away from computer vision? So perhaps the most widely used kind of model used in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3505" target="_blank">00:58:25.820</a></span> | <span class="t">industry is tabular analysis. So taking things like spreadsheets and database tables and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3510" target="_blank">00:58:30.420</a></span> | <span class="t">trying to predict columns of those. So in tabular analysis, it really looks very similar</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3522" target="_blank">00:58:42.780</a></span> | <span class="t">to what we've seen already. We grab some data, and you'll see when I call this untied data,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3529" target="_blank">00:58:49.140</a></span> | <span class="t">this is the thing in Fast.ai that downloads some data and decompresses it for you. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3533" target="_blank">00:58:53.220</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a whole lot of URLs provided by Fast.ai for all the kind of common data sets that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3539" target="_blank">00:58:59.220</a></span> | <span class="t">you might want to use, all the ones that are in the book, or lots of data sets that are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3543" target="_blank">00:59:03.460</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of widely used in learning and research. So that makes life nice and easy for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3548" target="_blank">00:59:08.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, we're going to create data loaders, but this time it's tabular data loaders. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3552" target="_blank">00:59:12.700</a></span> | <span class="t">we provide pretty similar kind of information to what we have before. A couple of new things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3557" target="_blank">00:59:17.900</a></span> | <span class="t">We have to tell it which of the columns are categorical. So they can only take one of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3562" target="_blank">00:59:22.220</a></span> | <span class="t">a few values, and which ones are continuous. So they can take basically any real number.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3570" target="_blank">00:59:30.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And then again, we can use the exact same show batch that we've seen before to see the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3575" target="_blank">00:59:35.740</a></span> | <span class="t">data. And so Fast.ai uses a lot of something called type dispatch, which is a system that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3583" target="_blank">00:59:43.740</a></span> | <span class="t">particularly popular in a language called Julia, to basically automatically do the right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3589" target="_blank">00:59:49.240</a></span> | <span class="t">thing for your data, regardless of what kind of data it is. So if your call show batch</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3594" target="_blank">00:59:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">on something, you should get back something useful, regardless of what kind of information</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3598" target="_blank">00:59:58.700</a></span> | <span class="t">you provided. So for a table, it shows you the information in that table. This particular</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3605" target="_blank">01:00:05.980</a></span> | <span class="t">data set is a data set of whether people have less than $50,000 or more than $50,000 in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3614" target="_blank">01:00:14.260</a></span> | <span class="t">salary for different districts based on demographic information in each district. So to build a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3624" target="_blank">01:00:24.740</a></span> | <span class="t">model for that data loaders, we do, as always, something_learner. In this case, it's a tabular</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3633" target="_blank">01:00:33.700</a></span> | <span class="t">learner. Now this time we don't say fine-tune. We say fit, specifically fit one cycle. That's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3640" target="_blank">01:00:40.940</a></span> | <span class="t">because for tabular models, there's not generally going to be a pre-trained model that already</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3645" target="_blank">01:00:45.300</a></span> | <span class="t">does something like what you want, because every table of data is very different, whereas</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3651" target="_blank">01:00:51.560</a></span> | <span class="t">pictures often have a similar theme. They're all pictures. They all have the same kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3655" target="_blank">01:00:55.860</a></span> | <span class="t">of general idea of what pictures are. So that's why it generally doesn't make too much sense</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3662" target="_blank">01:01:02.260</a></span> | <span class="t">to fine-tune a tabular model. So instead, you just fit. So there's one difference there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3668" target="_blank">01:01:08.060</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll show another example. Okay, so collaborative filtering. Collaborative filtering is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3681" target="_blank">01:01:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">basis of most recommendation systems today. It's a system where we basically take data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3686" target="_blank">01:01:26.940</a></span> | <span class="t">set that says which users liked which products or which users used which products, and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3696" target="_blank">01:01:36.340</a></span> | <span class="t">we use that to guess what other products those users might like based on finding similar users</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3702" target="_blank">01:01:42.620</a></span> | <span class="t">and what those similar users liked. The interesting thing about collaborative filtering is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3707" target="_blank">01:01:47.020</a></span> | <span class="t">when we say similar users, we're not referring to similar demographically, but similar in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3713" target="_blank">01:01:53.500</a></span> | <span class="t">the sense of people who liked the same kinds of products. So for example, if you use any</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3722" target="_blank">01:02:02.560</a></span> | <span class="t">of the music systems like Spotify or Apple Music or whatever, it'll ask you first like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3729" target="_blank">01:02:09.020</a></span> | <span class="t">what's a few pieces of music you like, and you tell it. And then it says, okay, well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3735" target="_blank">01:02:15.380</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe let's start playing this music for you. And that's how it works. It uses collaborative</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3740" target="_blank">01:02:20.140</a></span> | <span class="t">filtering. So we can create a collaborative filtering data loaders in exactly the same</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3748" target="_blank">01:02:28.620</a></span> | <span class="t">way that we're used to by downloading and decompressing some data, create our collab</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3754" target="_blank">01:02:34.340</a></span> | <span class="t">data loaders. In this case, we can just say from CSV and pass in a CSV. And this is what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3759" target="_blank">01:02:39.700</a></span> | <span class="t">collaborative filtering data looks like. It's going to have, generally speaking, a user</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3763" target="_blank">01:02:43.500</a></span> | <span class="t">ID, some kind of product ID, in this case, a movie, and a rating. So in this case, this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3772" target="_blank">01:02:52.900</a></span> | <span class="t">user gave this movie a rating of 3.5 out of 5. And so again, you can see show batch, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3780" target="_blank">01:03:00.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So use show batch, you should get back some useful visualization of your data regardless</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3785" target="_blank">01:03:05.420</a></span> | <span class="t">of what kind of data it is. And so again, we create a learner. This time it's a collaborative</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3795" target="_blank">01:03:15.340</a></span> | <span class="t">filtering learner, and you pass in your data. In this case, we give it one extra piece of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3802" target="_blank">01:03:22.340</a></span> | <span class="t">information, which is because this is not predicting a category, but it's predicting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3806" target="_blank">01:03:26.980</a></span> | <span class="t">a real number, we tell it what's the possible range. The actual range is 1 to 5. But for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3814" target="_blank">01:03:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">reasons you'll learn about later, it's a good idea to actually go from a little bit lower</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3818" target="_blank">01:03:38.820</a></span> | <span class="t">than the possible minimum to a little bit higher. That's why I say 0.5 to 5.5. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3825" target="_blank">01:03:45.260</a></span> | <span class="t">fine-tune. Now again, we don't really need to fine-tune here because there's not really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3829" target="_blank">01:03:49.060</a></span> | <span class="t">such a thing as a pre-trained collaborative filtering model. We could just say fit or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3833" target="_blank">01:03:53.140</a></span> | <span class="t">fit one cycle. But actually fine-tune works fine as well. So after we train it for a while,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3841" target="_blank">01:04:01.060</a></span> | <span class="t">this here is the mean squared error. So it's basically that on average, how far off are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3847" target="_blank">01:04:07.080</a></span> | <span class="t">we for the validation set. And you can see as we train, and it's literally so fast, it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3853" target="_blank">01:04:13.060</a></span> | <span class="t">less than a second each epoch, that error goes down and down. And for any kind of fast AI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3860" target="_blank">01:04:20.740</a></span> | <span class="t">model, you can... And for any kind of fast AI model, you can always call show results</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3869" target="_blank">01:04:29.820</a></span> | <span class="t">and get something sensible. So in this case, it's going to show a few examples of users</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3873" target="_blank">01:04:33.140</a></span> | <span class="t">and movies. Here's the actual rating that user gave that movie, and here's the rating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3878" target="_blank">01:04:38.420</a></span> | <span class="t">that the model predicted. Okay, so apparently a lot of people on the forum are asking how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3885" target="_blank">01:04:45.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm turning this notebook into a presentation. So I'd be delighted to show you because I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3893" target="_blank">01:04:53.020</a></span> | <span class="t">very pleased that these people made this thing for free for us to use. It's called Rise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3899" target="_blank">01:04:59.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And all I do is it's a notebook extension. And in your notebook, it gives you an extra</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3907" target="_blank">01:05:07.020</a></span> | <span class="t">little thing on the side where you say which things are slides or which things are fragments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3912" target="_blank">01:05:12.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And a fragment just means this is a slide that's a fragment. So if I do that, you'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3918" target="_blank">01:05:18.460</a></span> | <span class="t">see it starts with a slide, and then the fragment gets added in. Yeah, that's about all theories</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3926" target="_blank">01:05:26.180</a></span> | <span class="t">to it, actually. It's pretty great. And it's very well documented. I'll just mention, what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3932" target="_blank">01:05:32.420</a></span> | <span class="t">do I make with Jupyter Notebooks? This entire book was written entirely in Jupyter Notebooks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3947" target="_blank">01:05:47.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Here are the notebooks. So if you go to the Fast.io Fastbook repo, you can read the whole</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3954" target="_blank">01:05:54.740</a></span> | <span class="t">book. And because it's all in notebooks, every time we say here's how you create this plot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3961" target="_blank">01:06:01.660</a></span> | <span class="t">or here's how you train this model, you can actually create the plot or you can actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3965" target="_blank">01:06:05.180</a></span> | <span class="t">train the model because it's all notebooks. The entire Fast.io library is actually written</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3977" target="_blank">01:06:17.580</a></span> | <span class="t">in notebooks. So you might be surprised to discover that if you go to fast.io/fast.io,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=3987" target="_blank">01:06:27.180</a></span> | <span class="t">the source code for the entire library is notebooks. And so the nice thing about this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=4000" target="_blank">01:06:40.140</a></span> | <span class="t">is that the source code for the Fast.io library has actual pictures of the actual things that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=4006" target="_blank">01:06:46.020</a></span> | <span class="t">we're building, for example. What else have we done with notebooks? Oh, blogging. I love</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=4018" target="_blank">01:06:58.700</a></span> | <span class="t">blogging with notebooks because when I want to explain something, I just write the code</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=4024" target="_blank">01:07:04.820</a></span> | <span class="t">and you can just see the outputs. And it all just works. Another thing you might be surprised</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=4034" target="_blank">01:07:14.140</a></span> | <span class="t">by is all of our tests and continuous integration are also all in notebooks. So every time we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=4040" target="_blank">01:07:20.920</a></span> | <span class="t">change one of our notebooks, every time we change one of our notebooks, hundreds of tests</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=4053" target="_blank">01:07:33.020</a></span> | <span class="t">get run automatically in parallel. And if there's any issues, we will find out about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=4059" target="_blank">01:07:39.700</a></span> | <span class="t">it. So notebooks are great. And Rise is a really nice way to do slides in notebooks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=4071" target="_blank">01:07:51.180</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. So what can deep learning do at present? We're still scratching the tip of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=4082" target="_blank">01:08:02.300</a></span> | <span class="t">the iceberg, even though it's a pretty well-hyped, heavily marketed technology at this point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=4088" target="_blank">01:08:08.180</a></span> | <span class="t">When we started in 2014 or so, not many people were talking about deep learning. And really,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=4098" target="_blank">01:08:18.860</a></span> | <span class="t">there was no accessible way to get started with it. There were no pre-trained models</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=4102" target="_blank">01:08:22.380</a></span> | <span class="t">you could download. There was just starting to appear some of the first open source software</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=4110" target="_blank">01:08:30.700</a></span> | <span class="t">that would run on GPUs. But despite the fact that today there's a lot of people talking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=4116" target="_blank">01:08:36.740</a></span> | <span class="t">about deep learning, we're just scratching the surface. Every time pretty much somebody</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=4120" target="_blank">01:08:40.840</a></span> | <span class="t">says to me, "I work in domain X and I thought I might try deep learning out to see if it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=4125" target="_blank">01:08:45.700</a></span> | <span class="t">can help." And I say to them a few months later and I say, "How did it go?" They nearly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=4130" target="_blank">01:08:50.180</a></span> | <span class="t">always say, "Wow, we just broke the state-of-the-art results in our field." So when I say these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=4135" target="_blank">01:08:55.540</a></span> | <span class="t">are things that it's currently state-of-the-art for, these are kind of the ones that people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=4139" target="_blank">01:08:59.180</a></span> | <span class="t">have tried so far. But still, most things haven't been tried. So in NLP, deep learning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=4144" target="_blank">01:09:04.700</a></span> | <span class="t">is the state-of-the-art method in all these kinds of things and a lot more. Computer vision,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=4154" target="_blank">01:09:14.660</a></span> | <span class="t">medicine, biology, recommendation systems, playing games, robotics. I've tried elsewhere</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=4168" target="_blank">01:09:28.580</a></span> | <span class="t">to make bigger lists and I just end up with pages and pages and pages. Generally speaking,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=4177" target="_blank">01:09:37.860</a></span> | <span class="t">if it's something that a human can do reasonably quickly, like look at a Go board and decide</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=4187" target="_blank">01:09:47.420</a></span> | <span class="t">if it looks like a good Go board or not, even if it needs to be an expert human, then that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=4193" target="_blank">01:09:53.820</a></span> | <span class="t">probably something that deep learning will be pretty good at. If it's something that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=4199" target="_blank">01:09:59.140</a></span> | <span class="t">takes a lot of logical thought processes over an extended period of time, particularly if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=4205" target="_blank">01:10:05.700</a></span> | <span class="t">it's not based on much data, maybe not, like who's going to win the next election or something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=4213" target="_blank">01:10:13.140</a></span> | <span class="t">like that. That'd be kind of broadly how I would try to decide, is your thing useful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=4217" target="_blank">01:10:17.540</a></span> | <span class="t">for deep, good for deep learning or not. It's been a long time to get to this point. Yes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=4226" target="_blank">01:10:26.700</a></span> | <span class="t">deep learning is incredibly powerful now, but it's taken decades of work. This was the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=4232" target="_blank">01:10:32.340</a></span> | <span class="t">first neural network.
