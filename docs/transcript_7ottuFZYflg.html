You know, assuming the computer industry can keep producing better hardware and keep doing computations, burning less energy. If they can keep doing that with Moore's law for another 10 years or 20 years, I think business as usual is going to take us a huge way. Obviously, if we get big breakthroughs, big conceptual breakthroughs, that'll take us further. I think one of the big breakthroughs is going to come is we're going to understand the brain. This is just a bet. My personal belief is we're going to get close enough to how the brain really does do these things. That suddenly it all begins to click and we kind of fall into a minimum where it's just obvious how the brain is actually doing this stuff. And I think we might be quite close to that. And that will be another revolution because that would affect all sorts of things like education and our sense of who we are. That would be very exciting. I'm hoping I get to see that.</p></div></body></html>
