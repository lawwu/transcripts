bit, but he was saying there's a $500 fine if you're seen using your phone in the clubhouse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=85" target="_blank">00:01:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">What I heard is he empowered Mike Trout and another one of the veteran players to actually enforce it within the clubhouse.</span></div><div

it's $500 that the players are figuring out the fine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=96" target="_blank">00:01:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">But you can't use a phone anymore in the clubhouse of the Los Angeles Angels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">By the way, maybe I should talk more like Mad Dog on the show.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You think we do his numbers?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't listen to a lot of Mad Dog, but wow, he's got a style for sure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=109" target="_blank">00:01:49.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh my God, he's got a great style.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=111" target="_blank">00:01:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And his numbers have gone up drastically after he's been on first take with Stephen A. Smith for like the last three years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So, okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Lesson learned.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=117" target="_blank">00:01:57.900</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm just writing down some notes here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Talk like Mad Dog.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Do show with Stephen A.

one and I'll work on the Mad Dog.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Simple.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.700</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know why more people don't have massive shows.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.720</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, so if we stop here and we say, okay, why do you think the Los Angeles Angels put that policy in the place?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=138" target="_blank">00:02:18.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I think a common answer for people who aren't following this particular baseball story or don't know baseball well might say, oh, it's distraction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Baseball is a game of focus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Baseball is a game of disciplined attention.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And they don't want their players distracted by lots of stuff happening on the phone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And so they're saying, let's get the phones out of the clubhouse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.280</a></span> | <span class="t">It turns out, however, if we listen to a little bit more of this clip, there's another issue that's also at play.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So we'll hear this unfold.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I'll tell you, I think it's a good idea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And it has allowed us to communicate with each other a little better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So there we go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So the real answer, and this is elaborated if you read the article coverage on this issue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">The real answer was not that the phone was directly harming the players, distracting them from the baseball game.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Because as it turns out, actually, baseball is one of the most focused professional sports activity there is out there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Because the games are very long, and there is no technology, you know, in the clubhouse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">You're only allowed to have specifically prescribed technologies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">You can have these iPads that have clips of opposing batters and pitchers on them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And they use an old-fashioned phone to call the bullpen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.420</a></span> | <span class="t">No technology in these long games.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.440</a></span> | <span class="t">You don't have technology in the dugout when you're practicing for the most part.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So baseball players already spend so much of their time just focused watching a game, playing the game, focusing on, you know, exactly what they're doing in the field.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Focus was not the issue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.020</a></span> | <span class="t">It was community building.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So they were worried that the players were on the phones in the clubhouse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">They didn't care what they were doing on the phones, but they cared about the impact on building a sense of community within the Angels clubhouse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.440</a></span> | <span class="t">They were on their phone instead of talking to each other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And they're not talking to each other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You don't get that sense of community, which can be really important for a baseball team to go hear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So what we get in this story is an important distinction about phones that we too often miss in these conversations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Which is there is a difference between primary harms and secondary harms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So primary harms are when the things that you are doing on a phone directly harm you in some way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So when we think about our concerns about phones right now, these tend to be the things that come up first, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=319" target="_blank">00:05:19.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So this involves, for example, algorithmically curated content that could outrage or even radicalize people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.780</a></span> | <span class="t">The mental health issues that teenagers have as they get lost down different rabbit holes on Instagram.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">The brain rot, a phrase we hear more and more, the brain rot that's caused from excessive use of highly distracting tools like TikTok.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Or for people who are older and, you know, in the workplace, the distraction, so the constant checking back in and out of your phone puts you into this state where you're constantly switching your cognitive context back and forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=353" target="_blank">00:05:53.260</a></span> | <span class="t">You never give yourself a chance to settle into a singular context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=356" target="_blank">00:05:56.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So you're operating in a persistent state of reduced cognitive capacity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.340</a></span> | <span class="t">These are all direct examples of direct harms caused by phones.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But these are not the only issues we deal with when it comes to our phones, just like we saw in the baseball example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=372" target="_blank">00:06:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So what I want to do here is actually take a passage from my book, Digital Minimalism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=377" target="_blank">00:06:17.260</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll hold this up here for people who are watching instead of just listening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.220</a></span> | <span class="t">This book came out in 2019, but I started working on it as early as 2017.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=385" target="_blank">00:06:25.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And I want to go back to a key observation I made in this book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's going to be a little bit of a time travel trip back to this like 2017, 2018 era.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So at the time, I had just published Deep Work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=398" target="_blank">00:06:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That came out in 2016.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=399" target="_blank">00:06:39.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'd really been thinking a lot about technology in the workplace, distraction, email, knowledge work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=404" target="_blank">00:06:44.140</a></span> | <span class="t">I had started work on a follow-up to Deep Work, which eventually became a world without email.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=408" target="_blank">00:06:48.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But I kept hearing from people when I was doing press about Deep Work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=412" target="_blank">00:06:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I wanted to talk about distraction in the office.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=415" target="_blank">00:06:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">It was being caused by what was happening on your computer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=417" target="_blank">00:06:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And people kept bringing up their phones.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=418" target="_blank">00:06:58.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I had this shift of attention around this 2017-18 period where I began looking into people's relationships with their phones, coming at this issue fresh.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=427" target="_blank">00:07:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to read you from Digital Minimalism about what I was seeing at that time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=433" target="_blank">00:07:13.540</a></span> | <span class="t">All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=434" target="_blank">00:07:14.620</a></span> | <span class="t">The source of our unease is not evidence in these thin-slice case studies, but instead becomes visible only when we confront the thicker reality of how these technologies as a whole have managed to expand beyond the minor roles for which we initially adopted them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=448" target="_blank">00:07:28.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Increasingly, they dictate how we behave and how we feel and somehow coerce us to use them more than we think is healthy, often at the expense of other activities we find more valuable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=457" target="_blank">00:07:37.220</a></span> | <span class="t">What's making us uncomfortable, in other words, is this feeling of losing control, a feeling that instantiates itself in a dozen different ways each day,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=466" target="_blank">00:07:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">such as when we tune out with our phone during our child's bath time or lose our ability to enjoy a nice moment without a frantic urge to document it for a virtual audience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=475" target="_blank">00:07:55.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not about usefulness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=477" target="_blank">00:07:57.160</a></span> | <span class="t">It's about autonomy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=479" target="_blank">00:07:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's what I was seeing back then when the people first began to become uncomfortable with their phones at a large scale.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=485" target="_blank">00:08:05.560</a></span> | <span class="t">The issue was not what they were seeing on their phone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=490" target="_blank">00:08:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">The issue was not specifically what Instagram was doing to them or what something like TikTok, which didn't exist back then, was doing to their brain or the political valence of the content.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=498" target="_blank">00:08:18.620</a></span> | <span class="t">It was them losing autonomy about how they wanted to spend their time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=502" target="_blank">00:08:22.860</a></span> | <span class="t">When they spent more time on the phone, other stuff was getting neglected, but these choices were not choices they were making with intention.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Stuff they cared about more wasn't happening, and more and more time was going to these phone-based activities that they had less value on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=516" target="_blank">00:08:36.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's this sense of losing control.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=518" target="_blank">00:08:38.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Those are secondary harms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=520" target="_blank">00:08:40.760</a></span> | <span class="t">It's what you lose when the phone takes over more of your time and attention.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=525" target="_blank">00:08:45.080</a></span> | <span class="t">These are two different things, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=528" target="_blank">00:08:48.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So in the baseball clubhouse, secondary harm is what we care about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=532" target="_blank">00:08:52.040</a></span> | <span class="t">When you're on your phone, I don't care if what you're doing on your phone is great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=535" target="_blank">00:08:55.260</a></span> | <span class="t">You're looking up statistics for the picture you're going to face.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=537" target="_blank">00:08:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">You're not communicating with your teammates, and you're losing that connection.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=540" target="_blank">00:09:00.700</a></span> | <span class="t">In our life outside of the clubhouse, right, secondary harms are really piling up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=546" target="_blank">00:09:06.700</a></span> | <span class="t">What are we losing when more and more of our time is being dedicated to the highly salient apps that are on our phones?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=556" target="_blank">00:09:16.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So what has caught my attention is that the way this conversation has unfolded since 2017, when I started working on this book, has been way more towards primary harms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=568" target="_blank">00:09:28.680</a></span> | <span class="t">When I was first working on digital minimalism, you were only first starting to get a general acknowledgement in public circles or journalistic circles that phones could be a problem.</span></div><div

a mainstream movement of concern through phones, almost all of the attention turned towards primary harms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

target="_blank">00:14:31.100</a></span> | <span class="t">There's another big point I made in digital minimalism is I was pretty clear that the technology supporters that I was butting heads with back then would always deploy a useful versus useless binary to try to defend these tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=885" target="_blank">00:14:45.420</a></span> | <span class="t">They would say, it's not the case that this tool is useless because here is a use number one, a use number two, and a use number

writing goes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1335" target="_blank">00:22:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a lot of writing, rewriting, throwing things out, coming back to things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1338" target="_blank">00:22:18.920</a></span> | <span class="t">That sense of this isn't quite right is the feeling, in the large part, is the feeling of writing itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1345" target="_blank">00:22:25.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's not writing block.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1346" target="_blank">00:22:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not a problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1348" target="_blank">00:22:28.140</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just writing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1349" target="_blank">00:22:29.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's because the main mechanism for producing sort of writing of non-trivial quality is the mechanism that was pointed out in that famous interview that Ira Glass did.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1358" target="_blank">00:22:38.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I write about it in Slow Productivity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1361" target="_blank">00:22:41.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I've talked about it other places as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1364" target="_blank">00:22:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's this famous interview.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1366" target="_blank">00:22:46.300</a></span> | <span class="t">It's on YouTube.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1367" target="_blank">00:22:47.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So I don't know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1368" target="_blank">00:22:48.540</a></span> | <span class="t">No one really remembers the original context in which Ira Glass, the host of the long-running NPR show, This American Life, was giving this interview.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1375" target="_blank">00:22:55.900</a></span> | <span class="t">But what he was saying to the people he was talking to, who was young kids or college students, is he was saying what matters is taste.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1383" target="_blank">00:23:03.080</a></span> | <span class="t">You have this sense of taste of what's good and what's not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1388" target="_blank">00:23:08.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And then creative work is the struggle to try to live up to that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1392" target="_blank">00:23:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's the evaluation of what you're doing and the saying, my taste is telling me this isn't really good or isn't good enough.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1400" target="_blank">00:23:20.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's that stretch to close that gap between where you are and what you know to be good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1405" target="_blank">00:23:25.960</a></span> | <span class="t">That's where good creative work is produced.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1408" target="_blank">00:23:28.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's what's happening when you're writing is you are constantly evaluating what you've written by whatever your internalized sense of taste is, your idea of this is what good writing is for this type of genre.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1420" target="_blank">00:23:40.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's hard.</span></div><div

of different ways you can write what you're writing until you match your definition of, oh, this feels good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1429" target="_blank">00:23:49.740</a></span> | <span class="t">For me, it's very visceral.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1430" target="_blank">00:23:50.940</a></span> | <span class="t">I've told you about this before, Jesse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1432" target="_blank">00:23:52.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I feel like in my gut uncomfortable when writing is not quite right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1438" target="_blank">00:23:58.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's actually, you know, this is why I think there's a lot of connection between the work I do as a theoretical computer scientist doing algorithm theory, mathematics, basically, and writing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1448" target="_blank">00:24:08.680</a></span> | <span class="t">They feel like they're very different magisteria, but they're not really because when you're working on a math proof, people who do math proofs for a living will tell you this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1455" target="_blank">00:24:15.700</a></span> | <span class="t">It's definitely my experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1457" target="_blank">00:24:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a lot of it is you feel this isn't quite right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1461" target="_blank">00:24:21.960</a></span> | <span class="t">These pieces aren't clicking together.</span></div><div

this is right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1467" target="_blank">00:24:27.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And then like a really nice proof falls out of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1470" target="_blank">00:24:30.580</a></span> | <span class="t">What's really happening here is your head has been exposed to a lot of proofs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1473" target="_blank">00:24:33.720</a></span> | <span class="t">You have an analytical brain and in the background, it's trying things out and it's kind of projecting ahead.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1478" target="_blank">00:24:38.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And if the proof isn't really working, it sees things not quite clicking and it feels uncomfortable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1482" target="_blank">00:24:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So people who do applied mathematics for a living feel physical discomfort when pieces aren't clicking together right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1488" target="_blank">00:24:48.260</a></span> | <span class="t">The same thing happens when I'm writing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1490" target="_blank">00:24:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">The structure is not clicking together right.</span></div><div

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1510" target="_blank">00:25:10.920</a></span> | <span class="t">What is this really adding?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1511" target="_blank">00:25:11.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Your mind is evaluating the writing and all these factors.</span></div><div

it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1518" target="_blank">00:25:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's all about what you're producing doesn't yet meet your taste.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1522" target="_blank">00:25:22.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's why writing is often hard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1524" target="_blank">00:25:24.060</a></span> | <span class="t">It's what leads to like what happened to me with the book I'm working on now, where I largely threw out most of what I wrote between July and December.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1533" target="_blank">00:25:33.220</a></span> | <span class="t">I kept a lot of the research and stuff and the ideas, but a lot of the pros I threw out and then restarted again in February.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1540" target="_blank">00:25:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And now when I'm coming at it and now when I'm coming at it a second time, I'm feeling better about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1544" target="_blank">00:25:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm like, okay, yeah, this is getting up to my taste.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1546" target="_blank">00:25:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think what was happening in this instance, I was reflecting on this, is at the first time through, I was trying to get the ideas out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1551" target="_blank">00:25:51.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's what I want to say.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1552" target="_blank">00:25:52.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I wanted to do the right research.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1553" target="_blank">00:25:53.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to have the right points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1555" target="_blank">00:25:55.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And that was taking up a lot of my attention, but it wasn't flowing right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1559" target="_blank">00:25:59.140</a></span> | <span class="t">It wasn't, you know, the best possible way to convey that information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1562" target="_blank">00:26:02.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And so now my second time through, I could put all of my attention on craft and structure because I already have the information and research and now it's flowing much easier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1569" target="_blank">00:26:09.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So it just takes time to write.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1570" target="_blank">00:26:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">One thing I do want to point out is a point about the Ira Glass Taste interview that I made in my book Slow Productivity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1579" target="_blank">00:26:19.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And I want to point this out because it gives me a secret reason to play the slow productivity theme music.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1585" target="_blank">00:26:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Because, Jesse, this is my new plan, is to sneak in references to slow productivity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1589" target="_blank">00:26:29.320</a></span> | <span class="t">The corner, the slow productivity corner might be gone, but I'm going to find references to my book Slow Productivity so we can still hear the music.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1596" target="_blank">00:26:36.500</a></span> | <span class="t">In that book, I argue there's a nuance that Glass misses in this interview, which is improving your taste.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1606" target="_blank">00:26:46.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So when he's talking in the famous interview about taste and creative work, he's just saying you have this taste and the whole thing is just the struggle to live up to the taste.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1615" target="_blank">00:26:55.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And in that struggle is where creative work happens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1618" target="_blank">00:26:58.340</a></span> | <span class="t">But you don't start with a really refined taste.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1621" target="_blank">00:27:01.420</a></span> | <span class="t">An equally important part of the creative process is improving your understanding of what good actually means.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1626" target="_blank">00:27:06.820</a></span> | <span class="t">It's improving your taste.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1628" target="_blank">00:27:08.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And we knew, because I'm, you know, devious in this way, I went back and found other interviews with Ira Glass where looking back on those early years of being a radio producer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1639" target="_blank">00:27:19.460</a></span> | <span class="t">he admitted, I thought the stuff I was doing was good back then.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1643" target="_blank">00:27:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And now looking back at it with the hindsight of where I am now, I can see it was really bad.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1647" target="_blank">00:27:27.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So he had to develop his taste.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1650" target="_blank">00:27:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's a notion of you also have to focus on reading good stuff, being around good stuff, writing for editing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1656" target="_blank">00:27:36.620</a></span> | <span class="t">You have to improve your idea of what good is and always be straining to hit your current definition of good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=1661" target="_blank">00:27:41.720</a></span> | <span class="t">That's how creative growth and production happens.</span></div><div class="c"><span

me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2043" target="_blank">00:34:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So the right thing to do there, I feel like, is you have these semi-regular checks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2047" target="_blank">00:34:07.640</a></span> | <span class="t">It could be every hour where you go in and you try to like respond to things and kind of clear out what texts have come in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2053" target="_blank">00:34:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">But people get used to it of like, oh, if I text Cal, I don't know if I'm going to hear back from them right away, but I'll hear back from them in a little bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2059" target="_blank">00:34:19.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And it just changes their, changes their expectations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2061" target="_blank">00:34:21.340</a></span> | <span class="t">The exception, of course, being if you're in the middle of a back and forth with someone like trying to figure out where they are, you're meeting them or something like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2067" target="_blank">00:34:27.960</a></span> | <span class="t">When it comes to emails and IMs, norms are not the solution here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2072" target="_blank">00:34:32.520</a></span> | <span class="t">You have to put in place alternative means of collaboration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2076" target="_blank">00:34:36.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I mean, look, I wrote a whole book about this called The World Without Email, but the problem with email and IM, I don't know if people still use that for messenger, chat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2084" target="_blank">00:34:44.580</a></span> | <span class="t">I think people use chat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2085" target="_blank">00:34:45.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2086" target="_blank">00:34:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Like Slack or Teams, you don't call it IM anymore, do you?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2088" target="_blank">00:34:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">No.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2089" target="_blank">00:34:49.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2089" target="_blank">00:34:49.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2090" target="_blank">00:34:50.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, whatever it is, chat, real-time chat, whatever it is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2093" target="_blank">00:34:53.400</a></span> | <span class="t">If the way things unfold in your office is through real-time back and forth communication, it's hard to just say, here is the new expectation about when I'm going to check email or Slack.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2104" target="_blank">00:35:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Because they'll say, no, we're trying to figure something out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2107" target="_blank">00:35:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We have a bunch of back and forth we have to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2109" target="_blank">00:35:09.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you wait an hour before each of these responses, we're not going to get this done in time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2114" target="_blank">00:35:14.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So really the key to reducing the frequency of email and chat checks in the office is to have alternative modes of collaboration that is not based on unscheduled messages that require quick responses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2126" target="_blank">00:35:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And now you have particular communication processes put in place for specific types of work that's recurring.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2133" target="_blank">00:35:33.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's how we collaborate when and where the information goes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2136" target="_blank">00:35:36.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And things like office hours and group status meetings that allow you to defer things that require back and forth communication out of inbox and channels and into these sort of real-time, regularly structured real-time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2147" target="_blank">00:35:47.520</a></span> | <span class="t">These type of things work better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2149" target="_blank">00:35:49.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Also, reducing the number of things you're working on concurrently.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2152" target="_blank">00:35:52.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So the number of things that could be generating communication requires responses going down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2156" target="_blank">00:35:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So really you have to re-engineer workflows to reduce the amount of time or expectation for you to be talking about work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2163" target="_blank">00:36:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2164" target="_blank">00:36:04.340</a></span> | <span class="t">What do we got next?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2164" target="_blank">00:36:04.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Next up is from Katya.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2167" target="_blank">00:36:07.240</a></span> | <span class="t">How should I organize my Trello boards?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2170" target="_blank">00:36:10.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Specifically, should personal tasks like parenting, household travel, and entrepreneurial responsibilities, client services, admin work, stuff like that, be split into separate boards or combined into fewer boards?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2182" target="_blank">00:36:22.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, so if you're using status boards, so something like Trello, where you have stacks of cards representing things and a column representing statuses, my typical recommendation is have one board per role, broadly speaking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2197" target="_blank">00:36:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So looking to your example here, entrepreneurial responsibilities, you would probably have one board for the role of entrepreneur.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2205" target="_blank">00:36:45.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Then these things within it, client services, admin work, creative projects, long, you know, these could be on that same board.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2214" target="_blank">00:36:54.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Unless you have like a major break, like as an entrepreneur, I have two major roles, day-to-day and setting up for like the next big idea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2224" target="_blank">00:37:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, then you could break those into sub-roles, but typically boards, in my approach, are dedicated to roles and not projects or types of works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2232" target="_blank">00:37:12.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Like having a household board is a standard thing, and that can cover parenting, travel, chores around the house, et cetera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2240" target="_blank">00:37:20.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So you don't want too few boards or too many, so think about roles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2243" target="_blank">00:37:23.220</a></span> | <span class="t">That idea comes from, I guess, originally Stephen Covey.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2247" target="_blank">00:37:27.380</a></span> | <span class="t">The idea of when you're thinking about organization of work, having different roles in your life is a Stephen Covey idea from Seven Habits of Highly Effective People.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2254" target="_blank">00:37:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what I would do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2256" target="_blank">00:37:36.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, it's subjective, but I have my boards, household, personal, like that's like non-professional is a board.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2268" target="_blank">00:37:48.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Writing's a board, like being a writer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2271" target="_blank">00:37:51.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Academia is another professional board.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2277" target="_blank">00:37:57.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, okay, here's an example, because I have a particularly complicated, task-rich role in academia as director of undergraduate studies at the moment, I broke that out to its own board.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2288" target="_blank">00:38:08.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's a subjective way I did it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2292" target="_blank">00:38:12.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And then when I'm done with that, that board would go away.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2294" target="_blank">00:38:14.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So like typically I have like those three boards and then sometimes if there's a big thing going on, it might have, it has a lot of tasks, any of the track, I might have a fourth board.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2300" target="_blank">00:38:20.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Or if I have to share it, in that case, I also share that board, I believe, with our associate director.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2305" target="_blank">00:38:25.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So I break it out for that purposes as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2307" target="_blank">00:38:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">No one right answer, but that's roughly speaking what I try to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2311" target="_blank">00:38:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you have a board for podcast stuff?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2312" target="_blank">00:38:32.980</a></span> | <span class="t">It's under the writing board.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2314" target="_blank">00:38:34.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's like my role as a writer involves like writing stuff and doing podcast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2320" target="_blank">00:38:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2320" target="_blank">00:38:40.680</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the way I see it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2321" target="_blank">00:38:41.300</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, who we got next?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2323" target="_blank">00:38:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Next question is from Derek.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2325" target="_blank">00:38:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">What is the difference between a two-status board and a reverse task list?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2329" target="_blank">00:38:49.700</a></span> | <span class="t">One should each be deployed?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2331" target="_blank">00:38:51.560</a></span> | <span class="t">What granularity of tasks should live on a public board that is shared with your team?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2335" target="_blank">00:38:55.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So reverse task list, this is where you keep track of the stuff you've accomplished.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2339" target="_blank">00:38:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So instead of a list of things you want to do, you keep track of here's all the things I did today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2344" target="_blank">00:39:04.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Two-status board, I'm assuming they're talking about a board that has like working on and done as statuses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2351" target="_blank">00:39:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I have a couple thoughts on this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2353" target="_blank">00:39:13.460</a></span> | <span class="t">But my problem with the reverse task list is that it goes back to more of a David Allen style idea of like, look, you're a widget cranker.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2363" target="_blank">00:39:23.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And what work is, is like cranking through widgets, getting things done, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2367" target="_blank">00:39:27.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Going to the name of his book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2369" target="_blank">00:39:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And his goal, for example, was let's do this with reducing stress.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2373" target="_blank">00:39:33.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Like I don't want you keeping track of things in your mind or being worried about forgetting things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2377" target="_blank">00:39:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">We want it like work to be a relatively calm process of just sort of cranking through tasks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2383" target="_blank">00:39:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Reverse task list also has a similar, it's less structured, but a similar psychology of like, hey, it encourages you to keep doing things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2389" target="_blank">00:39:49.220</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like the specter you're fighting against here is doing fewer things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2393" target="_blank">00:39:53.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, no, I'm doing stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2394" target="_blank">00:39:54.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Look at all this stuff I got

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=2403" target="_blank">00:40:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">The problem is that you're not having, deploying any intention at any sort of

<span class="t">But the motivating research on this is here in, like, the Northeast, we're like, ah, the winter's—it's rough.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=3400" target="_blank">00:56:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Then I read a better, a much better religion book, in my opinion, Jonathan Sachs' book, Letter and the Scroll.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=3407" target="_blank">00:56:47.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Another

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=3414" target="_blank">00:56:54.820</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, the late Rabbi Sachs is a fantastic writer, really just one of the better—you know, I read a lot of his books.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=3421" target="_blank">00:57:01.820</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=3427" target="_blank">00:57:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Original analysis and the classic Sachs mixture of religion with other ideas from other types of thought, from, you know, the history of writing systems, the development of philosophy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=3442" target="_blank">00:57:22.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, he's very good at mixing the secular with the religious and pulling them together into a tapestry when he writes his history.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=3450" target="_blank">00:57:30.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So he's a very good writer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=3451" target="_blank">00:57:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, one of his ideas from this book, that's, I think, really interesting, is he was talking about,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=3455" target="_blank">00:57:35.100</a></span> | <span class="t">okay, look, you get the rise of what becomes Judaism as coming out of the

class="t">And the real innovation of this emerging religion was this notion of, like, the person, the individual, as having infinite value.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=3478" target="_blank">00:57:58.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, everyone's made in the image of God.</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=3510" target="_blank">00:58:30.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is kind of like the way things are, and the rulers should be better than the other people,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHAvXGwkphY&t=3514" target="_blank">00:58:34.100</a></span> | <span class="t">and the other
