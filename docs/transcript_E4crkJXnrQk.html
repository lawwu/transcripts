That was the one thing that was reeled into me from an early age. It's one of the worst decisions you can make. And I still believe that. But I think especially since I've had kids, the idea of just spending money and enjoying some of it now, that has been a big mindset shift for me.</p><p>That if you would have told me that in my 20s and early 30s, I would have said, you're nuts. No, you think about how much you're giving up on compounding interest over time and all these things. And I do think that's one of the areas where the younger generation has learned to enjoy themselves more.</p><p>Now, older generations may look at them and say, they're overdoing it. They're spending way too much money. But I think that mindset shift is way different now of just things like paying for convenience and again, traveling and paying for experiences. I think that's something that a younger generation gets right.</p></div></div></body></html>
