You're still going to get there. It might take you twice the amount of time. The things that I said no to in my life, I'm not going to say I have regrets, but I wish I would have gone to the music festivals with my friends.</p><p>I wish I would have gone out to drinks with them instead of just building my businesses and websites. I wish I would have spent more time nurturing some friendships and relationships that I lost. I think you're right that there's times to grind and times to rest. Naturally, if you're younger, you have more time, you have more energy.</p><p>Right now, I can't do nearly as much at the age of 40 that I could at 25 when I was invincible.</p></div></div></body></html>
