platform.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So this might be your initial reaction to fine-tuning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.720</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like a gross idea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.480</a></span> | <span class="t">It's hard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">It's confusing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I would rather just write prompts like this and have the model do what I want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, that's fair.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I think for a lot of problems, that's actually the case.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Fine-tuning is really just continued training that optimizes a model for a given domain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So it might be useful for your case.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.480</a></span> | <span class="t">You might be better off sticking up with prompting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is one of the things that we're going to be talking about today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.220</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think the idea is to open up your eyes to all the options that you have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's do a quick comparison between prompting and fine-tuning and then move on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Prompting is kind of like a set of tools, like a hammer, pliers, whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I think those are some made-up tools in the back that don't exist, but we're going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">ignore those.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.040</a></span> | <span class="t">It has a very low barrier to entry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Anybody can do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.420</a></span> | <span class="t">It's very easy and quick to do small changes to quickly progress.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's actually enough for, I'd say, most jobs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, fine-tuning is like a CNC machine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=305" target="_blank">00:05:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You have -- it's a way higher upfront investment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.340</a></span> | <span class="t">You have to collect data, make sure it's clean.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.880</a></span> | <span class="t">The iteration loops are longer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.380</a></span> | <span class="t">You can't just make a quick tweak and rerun because the rerun is going to be multiple hours.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">However, they're more automated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.880</a></span> | <span class="t">If you have a pipeline set up for fine-tuning, it's a little bit more hands-off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.880</a></span> | <span class="t">You don't have to do all this manual thinking yourself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=329" target="_blank">00:05:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And finally, it is a specialized tool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.180</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not useful for every single use case, but there are certain use cases where it really,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=334" target="_blank">00:05:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">really shines.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And with certain kinds of fine-tuning, you can actually push the boundary of what is possible</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.700</a></span> | <span class="t">and do things prompting cannot accomplish.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So these are the three main types of fine-tuning that we support during OpenAI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.060</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're going to take pictures, there's another slide later that has this and more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=353" target="_blank">00:05:53.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first one is SFT, supervised fine-tuning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=357" target="_blank">00:05:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And what is this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=358" target="_blank">00:05:58.040</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just imitation, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.600</a></span> | <span class="t">You just show the model what you want it to output, and it'll learn to copy exactly that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.740</a></span> | <span class="t">The next one is direct preference optimization.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's about showing the model two samples.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=372" target="_blank">00:06:12.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And you say, one of them I don't like, one of them I like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Do it more like the one I like, and less like the one I don't like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And then finally, we recently introduced reinforcement fine-tuning, which is actually the magic sauce</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">that went into making 01 and 03 and 04 mini in all these reasoning models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.520</a></span> | <span class="t">You can use this algorithm as well on this platform.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=398" target="_blank">00:06:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And what you're doing, you're essentially providing a way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=402" target="_blank">00:06:42.700</a></span> | <span class="t">The model essentially figures out how to think about your given problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=407" target="_blank">00:06:47.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's get a little bit deeper into each one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=411" target="_blank">00:06:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">What does the data for supervised fine-tuning look like?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=414" target="_blank">00:06:54.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Like I mentioned before, you just collect a set of inputs and outputs that you want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=419" target="_blank">00:06:59.720</a></span> | <span class="t">For direct preference optimization, you have inputs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=422" target="_blank">00:07:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And then for each input, you have a positive output and a negative output.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=426" target="_blank">00:07:06.860</a></span> | <span class="t">I think we call them preferred and non-preferred.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=432" target="_blank">00:07:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And then finally, for reinforcement fine-tuning, you provide a set of inputs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=436" target="_blank">00:07:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then slightly differently, you provide a grader.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=438" target="_blank">00:07:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And optionally, with the inputs, you can provide some reference in order for the grader to be able</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=441" target="_blank">00:07:21.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to have a ground truth if you want, but really this grader can be one of a variety of things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=445" target="_blank">00:07:25.780</a></span> | <span class="t">that we're going to be talking about later, which is why reinforcement fine-tuning is so powerful,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=451" target="_blank">00:07:31.240</a></span> | <span class="t">because it does not constrain what you can do as much as these other two, but it still has its caveats.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=456" target="_blank">00:07:36.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're going to be going into all that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=459" target="_blank">00:07:39.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, what do each of these cases learn?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=462" target="_blank">00:07:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, you can look at the data, maybe you have some idea, but from first glance, there's a lot of cases</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=467" target="_blank">00:07:47.700</a></span> | <span class="t">that supervised fine-tuning looks like it might be able to do direct preference optimization versus reinforcement fine-tuning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=473" target="_blank">00:07:53.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, how do you think about what each of them is doing?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=475" target="_blank">00:07:55.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And the way that I find it most useful to think about this is thinking about what is the model learning in each of these cases.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=482" target="_blank">00:08:02.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So supervised fine-tuning is essentially learning a continuous mapping, or like a soft mapping, from your inputs to the outputs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=493" target="_blank">00:08:13.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, it's not exactly like a direct mapping like a table, but in essence, that is what you're teaching the model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=500" target="_blank">00:08:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">It's very, very direct.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=503" target="_blank">00:08:23.260</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just going to learn to imitate the data that you provided.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=507" target="_blank">00:08:27.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Direct preference optimization is a little bit more interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=510" target="_blank">00:08:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">It doesn't actually learn, like, each of the examples.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=514" target="_blank">00:08:34.300</a></span> | <span class="t">It learns the delta between the examples.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=517" target="_blank">00:08:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so if you imagine if you can, like, pull up your, like, mental embedding, like, latent space, and you project these two ideas there,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=525" target="_blank">00:08:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the positive output and the negative output, if you can imagine, like, what that difference vector is between them,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=531" target="_blank">00:08:51.880</a></span> | <span class="t">that is essentially what you're trying to teach the model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=535" target="_blank">00:08:55.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, finally, and this is also -- it looks straightforward, but it's actually pretty interesting, is learning to reason, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=542" target="_blank">00:09:02.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So reinforcement of fine-tuning learns to reason about a problem by learning to tune and change its chain of thought so that it is able to get this, like, higher success rate on whatever problem that you're giving it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=555" target="_blank">00:09:15.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So, what is each -- what is each of these good for?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=559" target="_blank">00:09:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So, supervised fine-tuning is the simplest of the bunch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=562" target="_blank">00:09:22.500</a></span> | <span class="t">It's great for classification use cases.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=564" target="_blank">00:09:24.500</a></span> | <span class="t">It's great for formatting and structured data extraction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=569" target="_blank">00:09:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Pretty much any case where you really want to constrain what the model is doing and have a very specific kind of output, supervised fine-tuning is it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=577" target="_blank">00:09:37.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is helpful for, like, distillation, if you want to teach, like, a very, very, very small model how to do this, like, structured output example and, like, prompting isn't cutting it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=586" target="_blank">00:09:46.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Supervised fine-tuning is the way to go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=588" target="_blank">00:09:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, direct preference optimization is a little bit more -- I'd say it's the hardest to think about of the three.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=594" target="_blank">00:09:54.740</a></span> | <span class="t">It's very good at learning tone-matching, right, because tone and style are these kind of little bit more intangible things that are hard to evaluate but easy to see if you put two comparisons together, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=611" target="_blank">00:10:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, this was really made in order to do tone-matching and also -- I mean, primarily, it is when you have A/B tests, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

data, if you've been using ChatGPT and you get, like, both -- like, two responses, this is why, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=630" target="_blank">00:10:30.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, this is the algorithm that is being used in order to, like, tune for those preferences.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=634" target="_blank">00:10:34.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, it's not saying, "Output exactly the one that I prefer." It's saying, "Output slightly more in that direction," whereas supervised fine-tuning is much more exact.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=644" target="_blank">00:10:44.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, reinforcement fine-tuning is for gradable hard problems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=651" target="_blank">00:10:51.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Some examples are, like, medical, legal, coding, just, like, things that are pretty hard to do but pretty simple or straightforward to verify.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=660" target="_blank">00:11:00.460</a></span> | <span class="t">You really, really, really want unambiguous solutions, and I feel like in a lot of these talks, we always talk about successes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=666" target="_blank">00:11:06.700</a></span> | <span class="t">I snuck in a little failure here later, so you're going to get to see that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=670" target="_blank">00:11:10.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's also a really interesting candidate for training an LLM judge model, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=677" target="_blank">00:11:17.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Because grading a problem is actually a problem itself, and so, if you -- like, grading that problem is a pretty verifiable answer if you have these, like, golden results that you want your LLM judge to be able to mimic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=695" target="_blank">00:11:35.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Cool. So, one thing to note before I get into each of these is that, each of these approaches, while they're very different, we are training only a subset of the model in each of these cases.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=713" target="_blank">00:11:53.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, this is why they're not amazing for learning, like, tons of new data, right? Like, RAG and other solutions like agentic retrieval are much, much better if you want to teach the model new information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=727" target="_blank">00:12:07.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So, this is called, I think, low-rank adaptation. Can anybody check on that? Yeah, I see some nods. Cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=734" target="_blank">00:12:14.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And essentially, for those who are interested, you should look more into it. It's a really, really clever way where you take the model weights and you decompose them into two matrices.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=743" target="_blank">00:12:23.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And then that essentially gives you a much smaller set of weights that you need to update in order to affect the overall model behavior.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=751" target="_blank">00:12:31.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you don't fully readjust the entire model. You don't make it forget the things it did before, but you still impart some new behaviors into it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=759" target="_blank">00:12:39.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Cool. So, let's start with a story.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=764" target="_blank">00:12:44.340</a></span> | <span class="t">When I joined OpenAI, I was working as a solutions architect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=769" target="_blank">00:12:49.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And what this meant was I was working directly with companies, helping them deploy their, like, AI use cases and applications into whatever domains they are working in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=782" target="_blank">00:13:02.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, one of our partners, one of our customers, was working on a low-latency function calling use case, kind of assistant style, based on, like, taking action.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=793" target="_blank">00:13:13.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? And so, you would -- the user would say something, and the model had to act.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=798" target="_blank">00:13:18.580</a></span> | <span class="t">But it was in an extremely latency-constrained scenario. Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=803" target="_blank">00:13:23.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So, they wanted to use -- back then, it was 3.5 -- GPT 3.5.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=806" target="_blank">00:13:26.900</a></span> | <span class="t">GPT 3.5 was very, very fast, but not very accurate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=811" target="_blank">00:13:31.060</a></span> | <span class="t">GPT 4 was roughly the level of performance that they were expecting in terms of accuracy, but it was way too slow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=818" target="_blank">00:13:38.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, they asked us, what can we do?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=823" target="_blank">00:13:43.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So, ooh, actually -- before I get into this, this would actually be fairly straightforward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=829" target="_blank">00:13:49.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And I feel like a lot of you could imagine how to do this if we had a lot of existing examples with, like, inputs and outputs, which they did not have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=837" target="_blank">00:13:57.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, we were left to figure out, how do you fine-tune a model when you don't have, like, this great amount of data -- or these, like, good examples.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=845" target="_blank">00:14:05.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, we took a few different approaches -- but I'm going to cover the two main ones that we used -- that proved to be pretty effective.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=851" target="_blank">00:14:11.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So, the first one is, we did have all of the functions that they wanted the agent to use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=861" target="_blank">00:14:21.300</a></span> | <span class="t">One more thing I didn't say, they were trying to do this with 120 functions, which was unheard of at the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=868" target="_blank">00:14:28.020</a></span> | <span class="t">I remember asking some researchers, like, you know, what is, like -- how many do we support usually?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=873" target="_blank">00:14:33.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And they were like, you know, five to ten, maybe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=877" target="_blank">00:14:37.620</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like, okay, okay, cool, cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=879" target="_blank">00:14:39.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So, this is actually the first time that anybody fine-tuned a model with over 100 functions, because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=885" target="_blank">00:14:45.940</a></span> | <span class="t">the capability was not possible before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=889" target="_blank">00:14:49.300</a></span> | <span class="t">We had to have this built for this use case.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=891" target="_blank">00:14:51.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So, what you're seeing here is the first step that we did.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=894" target="_blank">00:14:54.180</a></span> | <span class="t">We actually took the function schemas that the customer provided</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=898" target="_blank">00:14:58.580</a></span> | <span class="t">and figured out a way to create every possible, like, permutation of the invocations of that function.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=909" target="_blank">00:15:09.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So, for example, if we have, like, a toggle -- ooh, typo -- if we have, like, set lights and it takes one parameter and it's an enum,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=916" target="_blank">00:15:16.740</a></span> | <span class="t">here I'm essentially showing that the three permutations that you can have are set lights off,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=920" target="_blank">00:15:20.820</a></span> | <span class="t">set lights on, and set lights red. This was actually done completely deterministically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=924" target="_blank">00:15:24.660</a></span> | <span class="t">This was just, like, a Python script that I spent way too long working on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=928" target="_blank">00:15:28.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Then search song is kind of similar. There's more than one parameter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=933" target="_blank">00:15:33.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So, here I skipped the cases where you provide, like, multiple parameters, but essentially what this function did is it took a schema from a function,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=940" target="_blank">00:15:40.340</a></span> | <span class="t">and then it spat out essentially every possible permutation of that function.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=944" target="_blank">00:15:44.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And if it was, like, more -- if it exploded in complexity, we would, like, randomly sample from those.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=952" target="_blank">00:15:52.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So, this was the first step. Oh, and then if there were some samples that were non-deterministic, like Katy Perry or, like, were open-ended,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=960" target="_blank">00:16:00.260</a></span> | <span class="t">we would ask a model to, like, provide plausible values.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=964" target="_blank">00:16:04.740</a></span> | <span class="t">The next step was once we have those function calls, then we asked GPT-4 to go essentially from here's a function call, give me a command that would have resulted in that function call.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=978" target="_blank">00:16:18.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And we did this for a large number of the permutations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=981" target="_blank">00:16:21.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, some of you might already be noticing what we're doing, but essentially, if you, like, flip this in your head, now we have these input-output pairs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=991" target="_blank">00:16:31.060</a></span> | <span class="t">where the input is the GPT-4 generated command, and the output is the function call itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=998" target="_blank">00:16:38.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we're already on a pretty good track, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1000" target="_blank">00:16:40.340</a></span> | <span class="t">We have a lot of data, but it's pretty -- it's synthetic, and we don't just want it to be synthetic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1005" target="_blank">00:16:45.540</a></span> | <span class="t">We don't know if these are the kinds of inputs that the users will be giving, and if we are very off-base, if we are, like, very out of distribution,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1012" target="_blank">00:16:52.340</a></span> | <span class="t">we won't have as good of a model in the end.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1016" target="_blank">00:16:56.020</a></span> | <span class="t">I will say, the models are pretty good at generalizing, even if you do stuff that is slightly out of distribution,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1021" target="_blank">00:17:01.700</a></span> | <span class="t">because they have such a large set of weights in, like, a pre-existing world model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1025" target="_blank">00:17:05.220</a></span> | <span class="t">The second way we did it was distilling some data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1029" target="_blank">00:17:09.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So, the engineers we were working with did actually have some unlabeled inputs, and we were like, okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1036" target="_blank">00:17:16.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, here's what.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1039" target="_blank">00:17:19.220</a></span> | <span class="t">You said GPT-4 was good enough for most of these cases, so let's do something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1043" target="_blank">00:17:23.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's just run them through GPT-4 and get what outputs GPT-4 would give us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1051" target="_blank">00:17:31.220</a></span> | <span class="t">After this, I didn't include this in here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1052" target="_blank">00:17:32.580</a></span> | <span class="t">We actually did some filtering as well, and, like, we did a couple stages in this pipeline to essentially</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1056" target="_blank">00:17:36.900</a></span> | <span class="t">generate a lot of, like, distilled -- still synthetic data, but hopefully very high quality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1066" target="_blank">00:17:46.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And in the end, we took these two data sets, passed them into GPT-3.5,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1071" target="_blank">00:17:51.140</a></span> | <span class="t">and we achieved GPT-4 level performance at 3.5 accuracy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1077" target="_blank">00:17:57.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, this was one of the first, like, major successes that I saw with supervised fine-tuning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1083" target="_blank">00:18:03.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, note that this is a very constrained use case, so it's actually perfect for fine-tuning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1088" target="_blank">00:18:08.900</a></span> | <span class="t">The model doesn't have to do this, like, open-ended response. You're not trying to strive for a certain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1092" target="_blank">00:18:12.340</a></span> | <span class="t">personality. You just want it to call one function, and you want it to do it well, and you want it to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1097" target="_blank">00:18:17.300</a></span> | <span class="t">do it fast. So this is a perfect use case to do distillation with supervised fine-tuning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1102" target="_blank">00:18:22.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Actually, I want to keep this interactive. I'll pause every now and then. Feel free to ask any</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1109" target="_blank">00:18:29.300</a></span> | <span class="t">questions. If I don't see any hands, I'll just, like, barrel along. Okay. I see a couple back there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1117" target="_blank">00:18:37.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. I think they're coming to you with a mic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1121" target="_blank">00:18:41.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Six? I can just, yeah. Could you have distilled without synthetic?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1136" target="_blank">00:18:56.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So the question is, could we have distilled without synthetic data? I think we would have preferred to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1141" target="_blank">00:19:01.940</a></span> | <span class="t">distill without synthetic data, right? I think the use case that we -- like, the perfect case here is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1146" target="_blank">00:19:06.820</a></span> | <span class="t">engineers come to us, and they're like, hey, we want to get this model to be really, really fast,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1150" target="_blank">00:19:10.260</a></span> | <span class="t">and we have 1,000 labeled examples. And we're like, great! We'll get back to you in, like, a day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1155" target="_blank">00:19:15.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Instead, this is what we had to do. But yeah, that's a good question. I think there's one back there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1161" target="_blank">00:19:21.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So the question was, what was the ratio between synthetic and slightly less synthetic data?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1179" target="_blank">00:19:39.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And how many examples did we need? I think I'll answer the second one first, which is -- and I have this in a demo, and we'll look at the performance. So, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1190" target="_blank">00:19:50.660</a></span> | <span class="t">at around, like, 50 to 100 examples, you start to see signs of life. And that might be, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1196" target="_blank">00:19:56.260</a></span> | <span class="t">already enough for some smaller problems. Then if you start, like, pushing more toward production,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1200" target="_blank">00:20:00.500</a></span> | <span class="t">you might want to scale up to, like, a few hundred, 500 examples. In the demos I have later, I used 150</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1207" target="_blank">00:20:07.620</a></span> | <span class="t">examples and 500 examples. But this is for supervised fine-tuning. For the other two kinds, you can actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1214" target="_blank">00:20:14.420</a></span> | <span class="t">use fewer, and it's more forgiving. And we will talk about that in a second. And then the first one was,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1220" target="_blank">00:20:20.740</a></span> | <span class="t">what is the ratio? I don't remember. I think I tried some ablations where, like, I only provided one of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1226" target="_blank">00:20:26.420</a></span> | <span class="t">the -- one of each. And, like, it was best when I provided both together. But I can't tell you what -- I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1232" target="_blank">00:20:32.980</a></span> | <span class="t">remember what the ratio was. Yep. Okay. So you -- you said that there was around 100 functions?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1240" target="_blank">00:20:40.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes. Okay. Yeah. I pretty much had the same question. So you're -- you're basically saying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1244" target="_blank">00:20:44.740</a></span> | <span class="t">for each function you had around 50 to 100 synthetic examples.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1248" target="_blank">00:20:48.980</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't remember -- it was -- I've said a lot of numbers around 100 and 500. But I think they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1257" target="_blank">00:20:57.620</a></span> | <span class="t">being maybe conflated. We had 100 functions, around 100 functions. Each one we generated -- I think it was,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1264" target="_blank">00:21:04.820</a></span> | <span class="t">like, between 20 and 200 -- like, we tried different amounts -- like, between 20 and 200 examples,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1271" target="_blank">00:21:11.460</a></span> | <span class="t">depending on how many permutations each function would give us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1274" target="_blank">00:21:14.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Mm-hmm. And then also depending on which -- which of the inputs. So all in all, I think it was in the,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1281" target="_blank">00:21:21.780</a></span> | <span class="t">like, like, high hundreds, low thousands. Maybe, like, yeah, low to mid thousands of examples that we used. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1289" target="_blank">00:21:29.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And -- sorry if I'm skipping ahead here, but was there -- did that improve the function call accuracy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1297" target="_blank">00:21:37.700</a></span> | <span class="t">for, like, choosing which function to call? Or did it just improve, like, how well it would call a function?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1302" target="_blank">00:21:42.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So, like, choosing the function versus, like, populating the function parameters?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1309" target="_blank">00:21:49.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes. Both.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1310" target="_blank">00:21:50.340</a></span> | <span class="t">It improved both. Awesome.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1311" target="_blank">00:21:51.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, yeah. I mean, we -- if I remember correctly, we got to, like, within 2% of GPT-4</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1316" target="_blank">00:21:56.820</a></span> | <span class="t">at, like, a very small fraction of the latency. Yeah. Something else that we tried was, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1322" target="_blank">00:22:02.420</a></span> | <span class="t">what happens if you remove all the context -- all the functions from context, or, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1326" target="_blank">00:22:06.180</a></span> | <span class="t">the parameters from context? Like, can it learn the parameters, like -- because we wanted to, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1331" target="_blank">00:22:11.060</a></span> | <span class="t">really squeeze out as much context as we could to, like, reduce latency? And you know when you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1335" target="_blank">00:22:15.140</a></span> | <span class="t">cutting input context for latency reductions, you're, like -- like, you're out of options, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1341" target="_blank">00:22:21.700</a></span> | <span class="t">You should never start with that. But we were trying everything. And that was actually not very good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1346" target="_blank">00:22:26.180</a></span> | <span class="t">results. We realized, like, having things in context -- like, removing them from context -- makes it much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1351" target="_blank">00:22:31.940</a></span> | <span class="t">harder to learn through fine-tuning. It's not as -- as good. Thanks. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1357" target="_blank">00:22:37.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So how -- follow-up questions that -- in the future, if they have more functions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1364" target="_blank">00:22:44.900</a></span> | <span class="t">then do they need to retrain everything?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1368" target="_blank">00:22:48.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh -- Let's say they have 100, and, you know, they just have two more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1374" target="_blank">00:22:54.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes. So they would not scale, right? I believe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1377" target="_blank">00:22:57.380</a></span> | <span class="t">This -- this does not scale in that way. If you, like, add new functions, you -- like, in this exact setup that we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1383" target="_blank">00:23:03.540</a></span> | <span class="t">have, you would need to -- to retrain. There are ways to just pick up training from where you left off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1389" target="_blank">00:23:09.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, you can fine-tune an already fine-tuned model. And it just continues the fine-tune process,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1394" target="_blank">00:23:14.740</a></span> | <span class="t">essentially. And would that be okay? Like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1396" target="_blank">00:23:16.500</a></span> | <span class="t">if you fine-tune on top of this with a few examples? I feel like it -- it could be. Especially for this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1401" target="_blank">00:23:21.940</a></span> | <span class="t">case. It's so constrained. I think you can get away with a lot in cases that are this constrained.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1406" target="_blank">00:23:26.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Got it. Yeah. I'll take maybe one more, and then we will keep going. Yeah?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1410" target="_blank">00:23:30.660</a></span> | <span class="t">How did your -- how did the prompts change when you did this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1414" target="_blank">00:23:34.500</a></span> | <span class="t">How did the prompts change? How did the prompts change when I did this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1418" target="_blank">00:23:38.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, did you have -- were you able to reduce context, and, like, what does each tool do?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1422" target="_blank">00:23:42.980</a></span> | <span class="t">I see. Uh, yeah, in terms of -- so I think, um, the question is around, like, how much we managed to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1429" target="_blank">00:23:49.380</a></span> | <span class="t">reduce the prompt size and, like, context that we put into the model. The answer is a bit, but not that much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1435" target="_blank">00:23:55.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, we were able to get rid of most of the prompt and just say, like, classify into, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1439" target="_blank">00:23:59.460</a></span> | <span class="t">one of these, and then here's all the functions. But we weren't able to remove, like, types or the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1444" target="_blank">00:24:04.820</a></span> | <span class="t">different parts of the functions themselves from the context without losing performance. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1450" target="_blank">00:24:10.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Which was much more of an issue then, because we were working with, like, a 4K context window.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1455" target="_blank">00:24:15.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe -- I think we, like, had to, like, push -- like, apply to, like, let us fine-tune a 16K model,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1462" target="_blank">00:24:22.740</a></span> | <span class="t">and it was -- whoa, it was crazy. Now it's, like, you're fine-tuning, like, one million models. No,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1466" target="_blank">00:24:26.900</a></span> | <span class="t">no problem. Okay. Um, cool. This is this case. I'll move on, and we'll have -- we have plenty of time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1473" target="_blank">00:24:33.060</a></span> | <span class="t">for questions. Um, and if you're more -- if you're curious to learn more, we did actually write a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1477" target="_blank">00:24:37.940</a></span> | <span class="t">that. So we're going to move this up in a cookbook called Fine Tuning for Function Calling. You can run</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1482" target="_blank">00:24:42.980</a></span> | <span class="t">it. You can play with it. It has most of what I talked about. Okay. Time for the first live demo.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1490" target="_blank">00:24:50.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's say we have a customer -- I wanted to find a data set that would be easy to find. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1498" target="_blank">00:24:58.180</a></span> | <span class="t">here I have cursor with, like, a very basic, you know, loading in OpenAI keys, yada, yada, yada,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1506" target="_blank">00:25:06.340</a></span> | <span class="t">but then I'm loading in this banking data set. And essentially what it does, if we, like, print out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1516" target="_blank">00:25:16.020</a></span> | <span class="t">the first thing in the data is not happy. Oh. Cool. Um, we have some input text. You know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1532" target="_blank">00:25:32.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm still waiting on my card. And a label. And the label is, uh, some, like, index into an array of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1541" target="_blank">00:25:41.540</a></span> | <span class="t">labels, right? Uh, of, like, actual text labels, like, um, uh, user is -- not waiting for a card,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1554" target="_blank">00:25:54.100</a></span> | <span class="t">but, like, like, arrival time or something like that, right? And so what we want to do is we want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1558" target="_blank">00:25:58.740</a></span> | <span class="t">to get a model that can, like, classify this really, really well. And this is a good case for fine-tuning,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1562" target="_blank">00:26:02.420</a></span> | <span class="t">or for supervised fine-tuning. It's very straightforward, um, it's very direct, uh, and it's very constrained,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1568" target="_blank">00:26:08.660</a></span> | <span class="t">right? So, okay, so here I load in the data. I load in the label names. I guess I could have just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1574" target="_blank">00:26:14.900</a></span> | <span class="t">printed these.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1576" target="_blank">00:26:16.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Cursor abandoned me today. Okay. Yeah, activate card. Oh, yeah, yeah. We got, like, many of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1587" target="_blank">00:26:27.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And so as you can see, this is not, like, a super easy task for the models. This is, like, a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1591" target="_blank">00:26:31.380</a></span> | <span class="t">different labels they can pick from. Um, and this is as hard as I tried in my prompt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1597" target="_blank">00:26:37.780</a></span> | <span class="t">That's it. That's it. Um, and then it passed it all the labels. Um, and I guess this is a good time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1603" target="_blank">00:26:43.780</a></span> | <span class="t">to say, in supervised fine-tuning, your prompt does not matter as much, right? You are showing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1608" target="_blank">00:26:48.260</a></span> | <span class="t">like, a direct, uh, like, a direct examples, and so it -- like, you can skip a lot of the prompt</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1613" target="_blank">00:26:53.620</a></span> | <span class="t">engineering. Not all of it, right? If you give it, like, nothing to work on, it's not going to, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1617" target="_blank">00:26:57.060</a></span> | <span class="t">learn very well. Um, but, like -- or, sorry -- you could actually completely remove your prompt,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1623" target="_blank">00:27:03.220</a></span> | <span class="t">and if you have a constrained enough example, it will still learn to do the right thing. This is not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1627" target="_blank">00:27:07.620</a></span> | <span class="t">true about DPO and RFT. You still need good prompts for both of those. Um, as of T, I would recommend</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1633" target="_blank">00:27:13.300</a></span> | <span class="t">having at least a decent prompt. Okay. So we have our data. We have our label names. I loaded in the test</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1638" target="_blank">00:27:18.580</a></span> | <span class="t">data. Uh, and I wrote my prompt. So now I have my messages. Uh, I'm using the chat completions API because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1647" target="_blank">00:27:27.220</a></span> | <span class="t">fine-tuning right now, I think, works in that format. So I want to keep the format consistent. Um, so we have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1653" target="_blank">00:27:33.540</a></span> | <span class="t">our system prompt, which is this beauty. And then the user is just the input text -- uh, the user message</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1659" target="_blank">00:27:39.860</a></span> | <span class="t">is just the input text, right? And then I write this very simple function that calls the API and gives it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1667" target="_blank">00:27:47.620</a></span> | <span class="t">a classification, right? And so if I, like, test this out right now, um, look at that. So how do I look at my card -- card</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1675" target="_blank">00:27:55.220</a></span> | <span class="t">arrival? I guess that's correct. But, like, if I run it a few more times, you know, card not working -- like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1681" target="_blank">00:28:01.060</a></span> | <span class="t">it's not good, to be fair. I don't know if any of us could do this with this prompt. Uh, it's pretty bad.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1689" target="_blank">00:28:09.300</a></span> | <span class="t">But that's part of the point. Okay. So we have this sort of, like, inconsistent thing. Um, now, before we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1695" target="_blank">00:28:15.380</a></span> | <span class="t">even start doing fine-tuning, we have to ask, like, you know, should we do it? Right? And this is one of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1701" target="_blank">00:28:21.220</a></span> | <span class="t">most important questions in fine-tuning. I think this is part of why a lot of you are here. Should</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1705" target="_blank">00:28:25.380</a></span> | <span class="t">I do it? The answer is, how well is it doing on your evals? Right? So I wrote this very small, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1711" target="_blank">00:28:31.620</a></span> | <span class="t">parallel evaluation function, um, that essentially takes in a model string, a system prompt, uh, some,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1718" target="_blank">00:28:38.340</a></span> | <span class="t">like, input samples to run over in parallel, and then a number of workers, since I'm, like, shooting them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1722" target="_blank">00:28:42.340</a></span> | <span class="t">off in parallel, sort of, like, asynchronously. Um, I have a semaphore, just so I don't, like, violate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1728" target="_blank">00:28:48.820</a></span> | <span class="t">and, like, rate limits, or, like, the number of workers that I have is, like, fixed. Um, I'm, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1734" target="_blank">00:28:54.580</a></span> | <span class="t">logging the progress, and then I have my score function, which just calls classify intent, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1739" target="_blank">00:28:59.860</a></span> | <span class="t">updates the progress, and then returns whether it equals the correct label. And I shoot them off in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1746" target="_blank">00:29:06.020</a></span> | <span class="t">parallel. And there we go. So, uh, this is my evaluation function. You know, people talk about,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1753" target="_blank">00:29:13.780</a></span> | <span class="t">like, different, uh, evals, um, platforms. We have a way to do evals as well, as well on our platform. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1760" target="_blank">00:29:20.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I think I'm going to stick to this for this example, since I want to keep things, like, mostly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1764" target="_blank">00:29:24.580</a></span> | <span class="t">in this notebook. Um, and we can, like, see little pretty progress bars that I made.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1770" target="_blank">00:29:30.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So now we have GPT, uh, 4.0 mini and 4.0. This will come in later. Uh, and we can run it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1779" target="_blank">00:29:39.060</a></span> | <span class="t">right? And so if we run this evals, we're essentially taking the testing set, um, made up of 150 examples,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1786" target="_blank">00:29:46.500</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, running it. My progress bars aren't working correctly. That's fine. Uh, it's still finished,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1791" target="_blank">00:29:51.620</a></span> | <span class="t">right? So it just ran 4.0 mini, and it ran 4.0. And now we get the relative accuracies, which is 75%</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1798" target="_blank">00:29:58.740</a></span> | <span class="t">accuracy for 4.0 mini and 83% for 4.0. So, you know, not bad. Let's see if we can do better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1804" target="_blank">00:30:04.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, cool. So this is just, I'm taking the actual data sets and then dumping them out into files</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1814" target="_blank">00:30:14.900</a></span> | <span class="t">that we can use for training. Now, if the important part here is the format. So the format of a fine-tuning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1823" target="_blank">00:30:23.220</a></span> | <span class="t">model and, like, let me see if I can just -- I just love pulling up docs and talks. Uh, it's what everyone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1830" target="_blank">00:30:30.500</a></span> | <span class="t">else will be doing. Um, let's see. Oh, by the way, you should all check this out. Agents SDK TypeScript came out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1839" target="_blank">00:30:39.860</a></span> | <span class="t">today. Uh, where are we? There we go. So if we look at the format -- by the way, I know this stuff. I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1851" target="_blank">00:30:51.220</a></span> | <span class="t">not doing this for me, okay? This is for everyone to see. Uh, cool. So here we go. This is the JSON L,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1858" target="_blank">00:30:58.980</a></span> | <span class="t">which is just, like, JSON Lines data format that you'll want to be passing, which is, um, a messages,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1864" target="_blank">00:31:04.580</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, array -- like, a field. It's an array that you're used to, the one you know and love. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1871" target="_blank">00:31:11.380</a></span> | <span class="t">and all it's going to do is it's going to take the last assistant message and learn from it. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1876" target="_blank">00:31:16.580</a></span> | <span class="t">here the last assistant message is a function call, so it has, like, the whole schema. Um, but if we look at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1883" target="_blank">00:31:23.620</a></span> | <span class="t">the data that we're producing here, these are, like, you know, this is my amazing prompt. Uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1891" target="_blank">00:31:31.300</a></span> | <span class="t">these are, like -- this is all part of the prompt, right? And then when I get to the very end -- oh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1897" target="_blank">00:31:37.860</a></span> | <span class="t">boy. Okay. Uh, then we just have -- so that's the developer message. Then we have the user message,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1904" target="_blank">00:31:44.340</a></span> | <span class="t">which is the input, and then the assistant message, which is what we want it to respond. Um, and that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1909" target="_blank">00:31:49.860</a></span> | <span class="t">the whole setup. And what it's going to do is it's going to learn from that last message.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1913" target="_blank">00:31:53.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, so we can either shoot this off from the, uh, fine-tuning UI, but I am going to show you -- I'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1918" target="_blank">00:31:58.980</a></span> | <span class="t">show you how to do both. Um, cool. So now what we're doing is we're taking the dataset, putting it in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1923" target="_blank">00:32:03.780</a></span> | <span class="t">this format, and saving it, and calling it train. Uh, we then, like, upload the files. So it's important</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1931" target="_blank">00:32:11.220</a></span> | <span class="t">that we -- like, for us to reference files within a fine-tuning job, we have to upload them to the OpenAI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1936" target="_blank">00:32:16.180</a></span> | <span class="t">API first. So client.files.create -- we have to set the purpose to fine-tune, give it the file,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1943" target="_blank">00:32:23.620</a></span> | <span class="t">here are the file IDs that we have. And now, fine-tuning is as simple as, like, this API call,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1949" target="_blank">00:32:29.140</a></span> | <span class="t">right? We pass in the base model. Uh, the reason I had the mappings between, like, the base model,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1954" target="_blank">00:32:34.580</a></span> | <span class="t">like, 4.0 and, like, the full snapshot is because it can't take in, um, aliases. It has to take in,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1960" target="_blank">00:32:40.260</a></span> | <span class="t">like, the full snapshot. Then we pass in the training file, which is going to actually train on validation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1965" target="_blank">00:32:45.540</a></span> | <span class="t">file, which is going to tell us how well it's doing, uh, so it doesn't overfit. And then I'm just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1970" target="_blank">00:32:50.580</a></span> | <span class="t">passing in the number of epochs. There's many more parameters you can play with. I just want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1973" target="_blank">00:32:53.700</a></span> | <span class="t">give you a sense. Um, so cool. I already ran this. I don't want you all to sit here waiting. Uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1981" target="_blank">00:33:01.860</a></span> | <span class="t">fine-tuning jobs can take anywhere from 30 minutes -- and this is on the OpenAI API -- anywhere from 30</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1989" target="_blank">00:33:09.940</a></span> | <span class="t">minutes to 24 hours. So give yourself time. Never do this right before a talk. Uh, cool. So we have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=1998" target="_blank">00:33:18.580</a></span> | <span class="t">our fine-tuning job. Then we load the model, right? We, like, check the model. Uh, we check the job. We</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2004" target="_blank">00:33:24.660</a></span> | <span class="t">see if it succeeded. We load them in. I actually already saved them here. And now the question is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2010" target="_blank">00:33:30.580</a></span> | <span class="t">how well did it do? I fine-tuned, um, as you can see, I made some examples with -- I guess I skipped</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2016" target="_blank">00:33:36.980</a></span> | <span class="t">over this -- but I made some examples with 150 examples, and I made some with 500. And I trained both</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2023" target="_blank">00:33:43.060</a></span> | <span class="t">four -- uh, GPT-40 and GPT-40 mini with each one, just to do, like, a little comparison. Uh, and so I ran it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2031" target="_blank">00:33:51.620</a></span> | <span class="t">and I also compared it against 04 and 03. And the final results at the very, very end, this is what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2039" target="_blank">00:33:59.620</a></span> | <span class="t">they look like. So, uh, baseline, 83 percent, 75 percent. Uh, reasoning models, a little bit better,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2046" target="_blank">00:34:06.820</a></span> | <span class="t">80 and 90. Um, but the fine-tuning models blow everything out of -- like, blow everything else out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2051" target="_blank">00:34:11.460</a></span> | <span class="t">of the water. Um, and this is kind of to show, like, how convenient fine-tuning can be, right? Like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2058" target="_blank">00:34:18.100</a></span> | <span class="t">it's doing better than 03 at a task that, like, I barely wrote a prompt for. And I think even</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2064" target="_blank">00:34:24.020</a></span> | <span class="t">4.0 mini -- yeah, 4.0 mini with 500 examples is as -- is, like, actually technically better than 4.0.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2070" target="_blank">00:34:30.820</a></span> | <span class="t">But, like, they sort of re -- like, are reaching much higher levels. So this is what I want to show</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2074" target="_blank">00:34:34.660</a></span> | <span class="t">how you can, like, get fine-tuning and, like, when it's worth it. Now, if this was something I could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2079" target="_blank">00:34:39.860</a></span> | <span class="t">have done with more prompt engineering, maybe. But, like, this is a case where I have the data. I want to run</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2084" target="_blank">00:34:44.660</a></span> | <span class="t">run it. Pretty straightforward. Uh, maybe -- yeah, I'll pause here again for -- for questions. Yeah?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2090" target="_blank">00:34:50.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Is the fine -- oh --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2093" target="_blank">00:34:53.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Do the fine-tune runs check for overfitting? And if they do, do they stop? Or do you have to be, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2102" target="_blank">00:35:02.580</a></span> | <span class="t">watching it while you're, like -- Nope. So the question is, do the fine-tuning runs check for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2106" target="_blank">00:35:06.980</a></span> | <span class="t">overfitting? No, they don't. I mean, you can see it. You can see it on, like, the diagram. Let me see if I can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2111" target="_blank">00:35:11.060</a></span> | <span class="t">actually pull up these jobs. Um, maybe this last one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2117" target="_blank">00:35:17.140</a></span> | <span class="t">I guess the second question, then, is do you just kill it after the diagrams show</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2122" target="_blank">00:35:22.260</a></span> | <span class="t">you that it's crappy? Or, like, how do you know what to do next?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2125" target="_blank">00:35:25.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, am I in a different org? Okay. I may have done this in a different org.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2135" target="_blank">00:35:35.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'll pull it up at a different time. But, uh, yeah.

Sorry. Uh, sorry. What was the question again? Do you have -- you do have to --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2145" target="_blank">00:35:45.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you see the overfitting? Like, what do you do?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2147" target="_blank">00:35:47.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I mean, yeah, you can stop it and try again. Uh, I think you're asking me a very, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2152" target="_blank">00:35:52.980</a></span> | <span class="t">data science general question. What do you do when you see overfitting? So many things you can do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2157" target="_blank">00:35:57.540</a></span> | <span class="t">In this case, specifically, it's like, you know, you don't want to have a 24-hour job.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2161" target="_blank">00:36:01.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.

Uh, here? Yeah. Yeah. Hey, um, a couple of questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2174" target="_blank">00:36:14.420</a></span> | <span class="t">How do you decide between, like, when do you want to fine-tune versus not, like, just lean to always</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2179" target="_blank">00:36:19.860</a></span> | <span class="t">using O3? Like, when do you sort of pick up to, like, actually go fine-tune? I'll get into this more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2184" target="_blank">00:36:24.500</a></span> | <span class="t">later. But I think the short of it is always start with prompt engineering and see how far you can go,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2191" target="_blank">00:36:31.220</a></span> | <span class="t">and then run evals, right? And so if it's as good as you want it to be, that's great, right? Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2198" target="_blank">00:36:38.340</a></span> | <span class="t">and if you are still changing the prompt and you are still getting better results,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2201" target="_blank">00:36:41.780</a></span> | <span class="t">there's no reason to fine-tune yet, right? I think fine-tuning is something you want to consider,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2207" target="_blank">00:36:47.540</a></span> | <span class="t">like, when you have enough data for it to be worth it and the data is, like, pretty clean and, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2212" target="_blank">00:36:52.340</a></span> | <span class="t">it's not really, like, uh, like, you kind of have to have, like, the resources ready for it to do the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2220" target="_blank">00:37:00.900</a></span> | <span class="t">fine-tuning. Fair enough. And then, like, which models do you, like, support fine-tuning for right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2224" target="_blank">00:37:04.500</a></span> | <span class="t">now? Like, does it keep changing over time? Like, I know if you support, like, you know, 3.5 and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2228" target="_blank">00:37:08.100</a></span> | <span class="t">4. Like, is everything, like, when it comes out, like, instantly going to support fine-tuning? Or is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2232" target="_blank">00:37:12.020</a></span> | <span class="t">there, like, what's the lag period behind it? I think we have... oop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2235" target="_blank">00:37:15.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, man. Uh, where are we? I think we now, like, say, yeah, which ones support fine-tuning on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2249" target="_blank">00:37:29.380</a></span> | <span class="t">models page.

Did you have to do any, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2257" target="_blank">00:37:37.220</a></span> | <span class="t">hyper-parameter tuning? Not for this. Uh, not for this. Yeah. Does it have any impact on the results?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2263" target="_blank">00:37:43.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, updating, running late? Sure. But I'd say that falls into the, like, the, the, the field of,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2270" target="_blank">00:37:50.500</a></span> | <span class="t">like, it's gonna, it's gonna be, uh, very case-by-case. You have to, like, run different, different things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2277" target="_blank">00:37:57.860</a></span> | <span class="t">There, there's not a lot of good intuition that I have built that I can share with you. Um, but I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2282" target="_blank">00:38:02.260</a></span> | <span class="t">sure if you, like, look online, everyone will have their own opinions. Yeah. Thank you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2286" target="_blank">00:38:06.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I'm curious on, um, after you fine-tune, can you still tweak the system prompt? Or if you do,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2292" target="_blank">00:38:12.900</a></span> | <span class="t">do you need to then fine-tune again? Yeah, that's a good question. You can tweak the system prompt,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2297" target="_blank">00:38:17.860</a></span> | <span class="t">but, um, you are now out of distribution. And you are sort of hoping the model was able to learn from your,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2305" target="_blank">00:38:25.700</a></span> | <span class="t">like, enough out of distribution behavior that it won't. I would recommend if you fine-tune the prompt,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2312" target="_blank">00:38:32.900</a></span> | <span class="t">always use that prompt. If you're gonna change the prompt, fine-tune again. Um, or just, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2318" target="_blank">00:38:38.420</a></span> | <span class="t">use many different prompts during your fine-tuning. You don't have to use just one. Uh, if you use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2322" target="_blank">00:38:42.820</a></span> | <span class="t">multiple different prompts, you might, like, you might prevent it from collapsing too much into,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2327" target="_blank">00:38:47.140</a></span> | <span class="t">like, one specific kind of behavior. Um, but, good question. Uh, yeah?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2333" target="_blank">00:38:53.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, can you go back to the notebook for one second?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2336" target="_blank">00:38:56.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Yep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2337" target="_blank">00:38:57.300</a></span> | <span class="t">It should look to be, like, fine-tuning the one-tune for four-o-mini worse.

That's a good question. I don't know what happened. I think, um, either I made a mistake,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2370" target="_blank">00:39:30.260</a></span> | <span class="t">or I, um, I would love to pull up the graphs right now. Uh, the reason I'm not is because they,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2379" target="_blank">00:39:39.140</a></span> | <span class="t">I think I ran these on the OpenAI org, and I don't want to pull that up on screen live. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2384" target="_blank">00:39:44.660</a></span> | <span class="t">but that's what I recommend you do. Yeah. Uh, yeah. Um, regarding, like, overfitting,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2392" target="_blank">00:39:52.020</a></span> | <span class="t">do you have, like, uh, ergonomics to do that in the SDK? Like, like, defining the test set, and then?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2398" target="_blank">00:39:58.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, you, you can define a test set, validation set, and it'll, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2401" target="_blank">00:40:01.780</a></span> | <span class="t">compute both. And you can determine when, when you see the, like, the curve go, go up of, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2407" target="_blank">00:40:07.460</a></span> | <span class="t">the test set, like, when you see them cross to stop the job, or you have to check it manually?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2412" target="_blank">00:40:12.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I guess I can just pull up, like, an old, older one. Um, I just don't know how successful they'll be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2417" target="_blank">00:40:17.860</a></span> | <span class="t">But, like, you know, you get these...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2420" target="_blank">00:40:20.580</a></span> | <span class="t">What was I doing? Yeah, but, like, the blue line is validation loss, and the green one is. This is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2430" target="_blank">00:40:30.180</a></span> | <span class="t">clearly, like, not an amazing fine-tuned run. I think this was pretty old, but this is, like, what the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2434" target="_blank">00:40:34.900</a></span> | <span class="t">graphs look like. Yeah. Okay. I'm realizing, uh, we still have a lot left, and I'm running out of time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2442" target="_blank">00:40:42.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's keep it chugging along. Um, cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2448" target="_blank">00:40:48.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So rules of thumb for supervised fine-tuning. It's best for simple tasks. Models can regress on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2456" target="_blank">00:40:56.980</a></span> | <span class="t">other tasks. So, I mean, this regression that you called out, confusing. I'm not sure what it was.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2462" target="_blank">00:41:02.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But the thing is, if you then test it on different things that you did not fine-tune for, you may see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2468" target="_blank">00:41:08.420</a></span> | <span class="t">regressions. So this is for very constrained cases. Data diversity is critical for that reason.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2473" target="_blank">00:41:13.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Anything you don't include might regress. Um, 100 samples to start. 500+ is best.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2479" target="_blank">00:41:19.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So, okay. DPO. Uh, training a model on jokes. Uh, so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2487" target="_blank">00:41:27.300</a></span> | <span class="t">my thinking here was, like, if we take a model, like, jokes -- like, this funniness principle is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2493" target="_blank">00:41:33.940</a></span> | <span class="t">like, very hard to evaluate for, but you know between two options whether something is funny or not. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2498" target="_blank">00:41:38.660</a></span> | <span class="t">this feels like a good candidate for DPO. Uh, so I generated a bunch of jokes for -- with 4.5, hoping</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2505" target="_blank">00:41:45.220</a></span> | <span class="t">they were going to be good. Um, most of them were not. Some of them were. Uh, I really wanted a data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2510" target="_blank">00:41:50.660</a></span> | <span class="t">set. And this is really what it comes down to. All of these are about the quality of data. I did not have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2515" target="_blank">00:41:55.460</a></span> | <span class="t">high-quality data. I had some medium-quality data with a, um, like, mediocre validator. So, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2522" target="_blank">00:42:02.820</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, then did some manual filtering. Like, did I laugh? Did I, like, exhale a little bit more? And then,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2529" target="_blank">00:42:09.300</a></span> | <span class="t">um, okay. The interesting part is, once I have this subset of good jokes, which really should have been,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2535" target="_blank">00:42:15.300</a></span> | <span class="t">like, a nice data set. Uh, remember what we're trying to do, right? We're trying to get some inputs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2540" target="_blank">00:42:20.100</a></span> | <span class="t">and then two pairs. So I went backwards again from joke. I extracted the topic. Um, and once I had a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2548" target="_blank">00:42:28.100</a></span> | <span class="t">topic for each joke, I once again went forward, uh, with 4.0 and asked it to, like, generate a corny joke</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2554" target="_blank">00:42:34.180</a></span> | <span class="t">for that topic. Um, and so what we're left with is, once again, input topics and then good jokes and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2561" target="_blank">00:42:41.780</a></span> | <span class="t">bad jokes for that topic. Um, and so hopefully the, like, main delta between those jokes is going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2567" target="_blank">00:42:47.860</a></span> | <span class="t">be one is good and one is bad. They're about the same topic. So, like, that delta should be stronger,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2572" target="_blank">00:42:52.420</a></span> | <span class="t">um, as opposed to just giving it two unrelated jokes. Maybe it's, like, ah, like, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2576" target="_blank">00:42:56.900</a></span> | <span class="t">he's looking for, like, cat jokes or something. No, it's, like, similar jokes. One's funny. One is not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2581" target="_blank">00:43:01.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, did it work? Sort of. Um, this is one of the results that I got. So two guys are hunting when one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2591" target="_blank">00:43:11.540</a></span> | <span class="t">collapses suddenly, stops breathing, and appears lifeless.

And then the guy comes back and phone, okay, now what? Okay, so,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2611" target="_blank">00:43:31.140</a></span> | <span class="t">is it original? I don't think so. But, like, you know, it's funny. Uh, cool. So, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2621" target="_blank">00:43:41.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, yeah, but, like, can you tell me an original joke right now?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2626" target="_blank">00:43:46.100</a></span> | <span class="t">It's exactly that joke. Exactly that joke?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2628" target="_blank">00:43:48.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Ten years ago, I never read that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2631" target="_blank">00:43:51.460</a></span> | <span class="t">I agree. Me too. I would say almost all the jokes that the models generate,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2636" target="_blank">00:43:56.660</a></span> | <span class="t">like, you are hard-pressed to make, like, a good one. But I think it's still, like, it's not a null</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2642" target="_blank">00:44:02.900</a></span> | <span class="t">result. Because the fact that it was able to, like, give me a good joke on command is a hard thing to do,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2648" target="_blank">00:44:08.580</a></span> | <span class="t">right? Like, I think if you ask Chachapiti for a good joke now, it's, like, harder to get that to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2652" target="_blank">00:44:12.740</a></span> | <span class="t">happen. So even though these are, like, not new jokes, the idea is to, like, elicit the good jokes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2657" target="_blank">00:44:17.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, what was I going to show you? Where's my notebook?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2664" target="_blank">00:44:24.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, yeah. So here is the data in the format that we said, right? So we have the user input,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2672" target="_blank">00:44:32.340</a></span> | <span class="t">then tell me a joke about topic, and then we have the preferred output,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2677" target="_blank">00:44:37.460</a></span> | <span class="t">and then the non-preferred output. Amazing. Cool. Let's keep going.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2682" target="_blank">00:44:42.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, okay. So DPO, it's more forgiving about data diversity, because if you give it, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2693" target="_blank">00:44:53.780</a></span> | <span class="t">a bunch of examples that are all specifically jokes, and then I ask for, like, a speech about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2700" target="_blank">00:45:00.260</a></span> | <span class="t">something, um, it's not going to give me a joke necessarily, right? Because it didn't learn to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2705" target="_blank">00:45:05.380</a></span> | <span class="t">say jokes. It learned to get funnier, hopefully. Um, so it's, like, that delta is important,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2712" target="_blank">00:45:12.260</a></span> | <span class="t">and it is less constraining than SFT. Um, it's much more for, like, these "what should you prefer"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2719" target="_blank">00:45:19.460</a></span> | <span class="t">scenarios, and, like, it's harder to evaluate unless you have, like, humans or, like, some, like, natural</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2724" target="_blank">00:45:24.260</a></span> | <span class="t">signal. Um, and you can actually run it after SFT. Okay. Reinforcement fine tuning. The one I wanted to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2729" target="_blank">00:45:29.780</a></span> | <span class="t">save time for, which I didn't. Eh, I still have some time. Um, the shape of it, as we talked before,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2735" target="_blank">00:45:35.940</a></span> | <span class="t">this is, I think, a pretty exciting one, is, like, as time goes on, um, I think more and more use of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2742" target="_blank">00:45:42.580</a></span> | <span class="t">this is going to start happening, because this is the first way, um, that I see that, like, we are really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2748" target="_blank">00:45:48.260</a></span> | <span class="t">making this algorithm public, like, this reinforcement learning algorithm public, and you can, like, become,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2753" target="_blank">00:45:53.940</a></span> | <span class="t">like, get soda, like, state-of-the-art results on whatever your task is, um, like, beyond 01 and 03.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2760" target="_blank">00:46:00.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, cool. So what does this algorithm look like? You have a bunch of inputs. Give it to the model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2767" target="_blank">00:46:07.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Model, for each of the inputs, generates this, like, chain of thought to the output.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2771" target="_blank">00:46:11.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Then you have your grader. Your grader evaluates the results, right? Um, how does it do this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2778" target="_blank">00:46:18.100</a></span> | <span class="t">However you want. Uh, and we'll get to that in the next slide. But importantly, when it performs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2783" target="_blank">00:46:23.620</a></span> | <span class="t">well, it reinforces those behaviors specifically and whatever led to that chain of thought. And so,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2789" target="_blank">00:46:29.940</a></span> | <span class="t">good chain of thoughts, um, that, like, get high scores are more likely, like, to keep going. Like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2796" target="_blank">00:46:36.900</a></span> | <span class="t">to -- it's more likely to generate those chains of thoughts that lead to high results, which is exactly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2802" target="_blank">00:46:42.020</a></span> | <span class="t">how, like, 01, 03 and these reasoning models are trained in the first place. So you can do this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2806" target="_blank">00:46:46.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, now, these are the very, very important things to keep in mind. You want to have an unambiguous</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2815" target="_blank">00:46:55.300</a></span> | <span class="t">grading. Um, in an example you'll see later, the grading was a little bit less, uh, unambiguous,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2820" target="_blank">00:47:00.500</a></span> | <span class="t">and the results varied. Um, you want very low -- and by unambiguous, it just means, like, if you ask a bunch of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2826" target="_blank">00:47:06.500</a></span> | <span class="t">people, uh, who are, like, fairly smart and have the same rubric how to get to the answer, they will all give you the exact same answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2832" target="_blank">00:47:12.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, you want very low noise data. So if you have, like, any mistakes in your data,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2837" target="_blank">00:47:17.620</a></span> | <span class="t">they're going to, like, magnify in a way that is not normal for, like, SFT and DPO. So it's very,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2843" target="_blank">00:47:23.220</a></span> | <span class="t">very, very important for you to clean your data and not have, like, noisy signal. You want it to be high</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2848" target="_blank">00:47:28.580</a></span> | <span class="t">signal, like -- and this kind of goes with the last one -- you want it to be able to actually get to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2853" target="_blank">00:47:33.380</a></span> | <span class="t">solution, um, because it's learning to reason. It's not necessarily learning, like, new facts or, like, new</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2858" target="_blank">00:47:38.820</a></span> | <span class="t">new things. It's, like, learning how to get to the solution. Um, and because it is, like, so -- it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2867" target="_blank">00:47:47.060</a></span> | <span class="t">very data efficient. You can give it, like, 40 to 80 very high-quality, very high-signal examples,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2872" target="_blank">00:47:52.100</a></span> | <span class="t">and it can, like, learn to reason over them and generalize, uh, to other examples in that set.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2877" target="_blank">00:47:57.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, cool. So now let's talk about graders. Uh, there's a whole myriad of graders you can pick from.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2883" target="_blank">00:48:03.700</a></span> | <span class="t">There's string, like, string checks. Um, there's text similarity. Um, you can write Python code,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2889" target="_blank">00:48:09.940</a></span> | <span class="t">sandboxed, no internet access, a few libraries, preloaded. Um, and you can have that Python code be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2896" target="_blank">00:48:16.980</a></span> | <span class="t">the grader itself. You can have, uh, score, like, model graders. So model graders are just, like, the -- like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2903" target="_blank">00:48:23.940</a></span> | <span class="t">using the LLM with a prompt. Um, one that outputs a score, one that outputs a label. And we have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2909" target="_blank">00:48:29.140</a></span> | <span class="t">multi-grader. You can nest these as much as you want. And then you write a combination function.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2913" target="_blank">00:48:33.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and so this is how you can define the grader. I'd say it covers most of the cases where you would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2919" target="_blank">00:48:39.460</a></span> | <span class="t">want to have something graded. Um, and you can get pretty, pretty good results.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2924" target="_blank">00:48:44.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So, uh, this was my idea for the talk. Um, I hate email. Let's make a model that can, uh, do the thing -- like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2934" target="_blank">00:48:54.420</a></span> | <span class="t">I -- it's not that I wanted to respond to the email. It's I want to know whether it has to show</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2938" target="_blank">00:48:58.900</a></span> | <span class="t">it to me or whether I can ignore it and never have read it in the first place. Uh, so that was the idea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2944" target="_blank">00:49:04.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So I made this little, like, email labeler for myself. And I became a little data labeling person for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2951" target="_blank">00:49:11.460</a></span> | <span class="t">a day. Um, turns out if you make an interface that is nice, you can go so much faster. Um, so I labeled</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2959" target="_blank">00:49:19.220</a></span> | <span class="t">around 600 emails. Uh, my -- my categories were, like, uh, am I going to glance, ignore, archive it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2966" target="_blank">00:49:26.260</a></span> | <span class="t">which is, like, receipts, store it, which is, like, I want to see it later, respond within different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2970" target="_blank">00:49:30.820</a></span> | <span class="t">time frames, take action within different time frames. I actually didn't end up using the topic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2974" target="_blank">00:49:34.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and I can download it as a JSON-L. Now, what do the instructions look like? I have some formatting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2982" target="_blank">00:49:42.260</a></span> | <span class="t">I have some classification instructions with, like, a little bit of extra instructions, but I didn't try</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2989" target="_blank">00:49:49.380</a></span> | <span class="t">very, very hard with this prompt. This will come back to bite me. Um, and then the input itself, I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=2995" target="_blank">00:49:55.220</a></span> | <span class="t">formatted as, um, like, this, like, XML-ish. So I wrapped each in an email. The input is an email with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3004" target="_blank">00:50:04.180</a></span> | <span class="t">sender, subject, date, and then the stringified body, uh, plain text of the email. How -- um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3012" target="_blank">00:50:12.260</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah. So this is -- then I formatted the data for reinforcement fine-tuning, which is a set of messages</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3018" target="_blank">00:50:18.580</a></span> | <span class="t">in the same way that you would for SFT or all the others. Um, and then I use reference answer. You</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3024" target="_blank">00:50:24.500</a></span> | <span class="t">can use any other fields that you want, but that is essentially fields that are accessible to your grader.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3030" target="_blank">00:50:30.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the grader, which I defined below, uh, is just a string check grader that takes the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3035" target="_blank">00:50:35.220</a></span> | <span class="t">reference answer action and compares it to the sample output. And if they're equal, we're good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3041" target="_blank">00:50:41.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, now how'd it go? Like, okay. Not amazing. Um, and I ha -- I think I know why, right? So first of all,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3054" target="_blank">00:50:54.740</a></span> | <span class="t">like, this is just my whim. Like, whimsy deciding whether an email is important or not. It's a very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3062" target="_blank">00:51:02.100</a></span> | <span class="t">hard function to model. If I were -- if I was asked to label the same emails again, would I hit, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3066" target="_blank">00:51:06.820</a></span> | <span class="t">a hundred percent the same classifications for all of them? Probably not. And that's exactly the scenario</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3072" target="_blank">00:51:12.260</a></span> | <span class="t">you want to avoid. Um, it was somewhat noisy. I think I, like, screwed up, like, one or two. Uh, and that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3078" target="_blank">00:51:18.020</a></span> | <span class="t">like, uh, compounds. Um, 150 examples, that was actually fine. Like, if they were a very high</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3084" target="_blank">00:51:24.660</a></span> | <span class="t">signal, this would have been, like, a better result, but they weren't. Um, and I didn't really try with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3089" target="_blank">00:51:29.700</a></span> | <span class="t">a prompt. The model doesn't know what I want, and it's trying to figure it out. It's like -- it's like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3094" target="_blank">00:51:34.500</a></span> | <span class="t">as if I gave you this task with the emails, and I locked you in a room, and you get to, like, maybe write</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3100" target="_blank">00:51:40.020</a></span> | <span class="t">some notes, uh, and I, like, slip you some food and water. Um, and then the greater, uh, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3105" target="_blank">00:51:45.940</a></span> | <span class="t">string quality, that was fine, but there's only, like, a few categories, so the model could guess</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3110" target="_blank">00:51:50.340</a></span> | <span class="t">some, and you wanted to make it not very guessable. Um, okay, so that was my failure. Now let's take a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3117" target="_blank">00:51:57.860</a></span> | <span class="t">look at something that, like, reinforcement fine-tuning is actually quite good at, right? So, um, predicting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3123" target="_blank">00:52:03.540</a></span> | <span class="t">the number of hydrobond -- uh, sorry, yeah, hydrobond -- I think it's -- yeah, hydrobond donors and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3129" target="_blank">00:52:09.140</a></span> | <span class="t">acceptors. Um, this is actually fully out of what I understand, um, but the model can learn to do this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3135" target="_blank">00:52:15.460</a></span> | <span class="t">quite well. So the task is to take in some chemicals, um, formatted in a specific format, and then predict</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3143" target="_blank">00:52:23.300</a></span> | <span class="t">the donors and acceptors, uh, to analyze it. And this is an example of one of the inputs. Um, now the output</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3150" target="_blank">00:52:30.580</a></span> | <span class="t">schema is defined on the left. We have acceptors and donors, uh, which are just two numbers, uh, and it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3157" target="_blank">00:52:37.300</a></span> | <span class="t">just has to output these two fields. And then on the right, uh, I have my grader, which is a multi-grader.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3165" target="_blank">00:52:45.540</a></span> | <span class="t">It just checks for each of them, right? And the weight is, it gets half if it gets the donor right,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3171" target="_blank">00:52:51.140</a></span> | <span class="t">half if it gets the acceptor right. Um, I'm gonna pause here, because this is an important slide. If there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3176" target="_blank">00:52:56.660</a></span> | <span class="t">any clarifying questions, otherwise I'll move on. Amazing. Um, so what were the results? Much better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3185" target="_blank">00:53:05.380</a></span> | <span class="t">This started at roughly, like, 65 percent. Um, it ended up going to -- I think it started, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3193" target="_blank">00:53:13.380</a></span> | <span class="t">touching 80 percent, right? And this is O4 Mini. Um, O4 Mini, like, does not have a very vast world</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3200" target="_blank">00:53:20.500</a></span> | <span class="t">knowledge. It really has to, like, learn to reason through things. Um, I'd say even this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3204" target="_blank">00:53:24.660</a></span> | <span class="t">result is not, like, fully exemplary of how good it can get. The reason it's not as good is because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3211" target="_blank">00:53:31.060</a></span> | <span class="t">it does need some world knowledge to understand, um, like, this sort of simulation that you have to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3216" target="_blank">00:53:36.020</a></span> | <span class="t">with the hydro bonds. Um, but you still see this, like, very, very high performance that it, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3221" target="_blank">00:53:41.300</a></span> | <span class="t">you would not get with something like supervised fine-tuning. Yes?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3226" target="_blank">00:53:46.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Can you use DPO for this? Could you, like, hear an email example with DPO first and then do that second?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3232" target="_blank">00:53:52.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. One thing I forgot to put in the slides. SFT and DPO you can do with non-reasoning models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3237" target="_blank">00:53:57.940</a></span> | <span class="t">RFT you can do with reasoning models, and there's no interplay. Yes. Sorry. He asked, um, if there --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3246" target="_blank">00:54:06.340</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm blanking -- whether you can do DPO before RFT. And the answer was, uh, SFT and DPO are for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3254" target="_blank">00:54:14.820</a></span> | <span class="t">non-reasoning models. RFT is for reasoning models. And it's like an IFF. Um, cool. So, some thoughts on,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3261" target="_blank">00:54:21.860</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, notes on reinforcement fine-tuning. Only for reasoning models. It's extremely sensitive to noisy data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3268" target="_blank">00:54:28.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, agentic use cases are limited by a single turn. Right? So, you can't yet have these, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3274" target="_blank">00:54:34.340</a></span> | <span class="t">long horizon tasks with multiple turns and function calls. Uh, and reinforcement fine-tuning. I would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3280" target="_blank">00:54:40.020</a></span> | <span class="t">love to see that. We'll see if we ship it at some point. And then, um, you want the data to be high</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3285" target="_blank">00:54:45.860</a></span> | <span class="t">signal, uh, and you want a solid grader. And if you provide both, you are likely going to reach, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3290" target="_blank">00:54:50.980</a></span> | <span class="t">state-of-the-art performance on the task that you are going after. Um, cool. So, this, I think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3298" target="_blank">00:54:58.660</a></span> | <span class="t">is one of, like, the most telling slides. I believe that is most of what I have for today. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3307" target="_blank">00:55:07.460</a></span> | <span class="t">I have a notebook. I have a ton of stuff that I didn't quite go through. Um, I'm happy to dive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3312" target="_blank">00:55:12.500</a></span> | <span class="t">into that. But I kind of want to leave this open for questions and, like, poking around, um, different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3318" target="_blank">00:55:18.100</a></span> | <span class="t">parts. Actually, how much time do I have left? An hour? Oh, great. We can do so much in this time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3325" target="_blank">00:55:25.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, you guys are captive. Okay. Yeah, I do want to do a little quick questions and then we'll move on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3333" target="_blank">00:55:33.300</a></span> | <span class="t">One thing I started and didn't do is another kind of tuning, um, which I can do live, which is prompt</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3340" target="_blank">00:55:40.580</a></span> | <span class="t">tuning, um, which I'm going to make up on the spot. So, if you want to see that, stick around. Um, but,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3346" target="_blank">00:55:46.580</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah, questions. Yeah. Yeah. Hi. Uh, so, I had a small question. Uh, so, you're saying that if I have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3352" target="_blank">00:55:52.820</a></span> | <span class="t">non-reasoning model and let's say I do an SFT step with it, uh, can I induce thinking into it? For</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3361" target="_blank">00:56:01.460</a></span> | <span class="t">example, if I create a dataset input-output pairs, which has, let's say, thinking into it as well. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3368" target="_blank">00:56:08.660</a></span> | <span class="t">would you call it the same amount of thinking as you'd get in a, uh, reasoning model? Um, you would get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3377" target="_blank">00:56:17.060</a></span> | <span class="t">thinking. It's a very kind of, a very different kind of thinking because it's, it's purely, it's learning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3381" target="_blank">00:56:21.780</a></span> | <span class="t">by imitation. Um, so, it's not learning to, like, uh, reason in order to get to an answer. It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3389" target="_blank">00:56:29.060</a></span> | <span class="t">learning to imitate the thought process, um, regardless of whether it's actually useful to it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3395" target="_blank">00:56:35.620</a></span> | <span class="t">or not. Right? Um, however, on the other, like, whereas reinforcement fine-tuning, like, it is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3401" target="_blank">00:56:41.780</a></span> | <span class="t">it is the one producing the chain. And so, like, if it gets to the right answer, it means that chain was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3406" target="_blank">00:56:46.340</a></span> | <span class="t">useful, like, in, in practice. And that is true for, like, every single time that it gets reward. It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3411" target="_blank">00:56:51.700</a></span> | <span class="t">because, like, it managed to get there. So, it's, like, it's pretty different. I'd say, like, yeah, SFT with a,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3418" target="_blank">00:56:58.260</a></span> | <span class="t">um, reasoning is, like, what we started to see a little bit, like, maybe a year ago. Um, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3424" target="_blank">00:57:04.580</a></span> | <span class="t">reinforcement, uh, learning is really how you get, like, high-quality learning. Yeah, like, chains of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3429" target="_blank">00:57:09.940</a></span> | <span class="t">thought. Uh, yeah. Yep. Or, sorry, somebody has a mic. Yeah. Here we go, yeah. Um, thanks, Ilhan. Could you go back to the slide, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3437" target="_blank">00:57:17.540</a></span> | <span class="t">where you showed the inputs to the RFT? Yeah, this one. Um, this one. This one. Does it, um, so for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3445" target="_blank">00:57:25.060</a></span> | <span class="t">calculate output, can I, um, basically, instead of just, like, a, a lockup into a dictionary, can I have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3453" target="_blank">00:57:33.540</a></span> | <span class="t">functions there? Like, like, to, so, so, can I pass in, uh, a function to check if the code runs, and I'll put a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3460" target="_blank">00:57:40.980</a></span> | <span class="t">number, or, like, a one or a zero, to see if it runs, for example? Um, can you, can you say it again? So, if, um, I'm just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3466" target="_blank">00:57:46.980</a></span> | <span class="t">thinking, um, one of the guys in the team is fine-tuning a model at the moment to write, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3471" target="_blank">00:57:51.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Triton code, and one of the checks he has is, like, does the code actually run? Like, is it valid Python?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3476" target="_blank">00:57:56.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Is it possible to encode that as a grader? You could do that in a hacky way. Yeah. Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3482" target="_blank">00:58:02.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you could use, like, a, um, a Python grader and inject the model response. Like, just do, like, um, eval or, like, exec,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3496" target="_blank">00:58:16.260</a></span> | <span class="t">which, if you've come to my previous AI engineer talk, I did the same thing. Don't do this. But you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3501" target="_blank">00:58:21.060</a></span> | <span class="t">could, you could, uh, get it to work. Yeah. Uh, if it has the right libraries and doesn't need internet</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3505" target="_blank">00:58:25.700</a></span> | <span class="t">access, which it might not. Yeah. And, um, just the, and then on the, the weights you have there,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3510" target="_blank">00:58:30.500</a></span> | <span class="t">does it matter the magnitude, I guess, of, like, what you're calculating? Like, should you, like, aim for it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3517" target="_blank">00:58:37.140</a></span> | <span class="t">to sum to, to one, or, or hundred, or, like, it doesn't really, like, match a massive difference?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3521" target="_blank">00:58:41.940</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think it matters. Yeah. Yeah. Um, it, asterisk in the way that, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3526" target="_blank">00:58:46.340</a></span> | <span class="t">it, it doesn't really matter. Asterisk. You can look into the asterisk. Yeah. Yeah. Cool. Thanks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3535" target="_blank">00:58:55.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, I want to do some in the back because I think I've been missing some in the back. Yeah. Yeah. You,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3539" target="_blank">00:58:59.380</a></span> | <span class="t">you mentioned that it wouldn't, the RFT wouldn't work for multi-step, uh, agent stuff. Could you talk a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3545" target="_blank">00:59:05.940</a></span> | <span class="t">little bit more on, like, why? And if, if you, if OpenAI were to make it work for that, what that would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3552" target="_blank">00:59:12.900</a></span> | <span class="t">look like? I just kind of didn't understand. Yeah. Yeah. So, so the reason I said that, um, is because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3559" target="_blank">00:59:19.700</a></span> | <span class="t">right now it only does a single turn and only evaluates the output of the model. If the model,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3566" target="_blank">00:59:26.580</a></span> | <span class="t">say, like, calls a function, there's no way to provide it the result and let it keep going.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3571" target="_blank">00:59:31.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. And so that's really what you want for, like, an agentic evaluation loop, which RFT does not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3577" target="_blank">00:59:37.060</a></span> | <span class="t">currently have. Um, I, I think that would be awesome if, like, we did have a way to, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3584" target="_blank">00:59:44.100</a></span> | <span class="t">um, provide the output of the model and, like, do these more end-to-end training.

Gotcha. Yeah. Thank you. I want to do in the back first a little bit. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3597" target="_blank">00:59:57.540</a></span> | <span class="t">For, for the HydroBond example with RFT, you can do a generic string check, but you can inject more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3605" target="_blank">01:00:05.300</a></span> | <span class="t">domain area as a type of balance files if it's only using, like, chemical examples. You know, when do you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3613" target="_blank">01:00:13.220</a></span> | <span class="t">need to design that type of custom grader, and when is a generic grader sufficient? Yeah. So the beginning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3618" target="_blank">01:00:18.580</a></span> | <span class="t">of the question was, in the, uh, HydroBond example, um, we use, like, yeah, this, this string checks. When is it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3627" target="_blank">01:00:27.300</a></span> | <span class="t">worth using more complex, um, graders? I think the answer is, like, where you think it would benefit,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3634" target="_blank">01:00:34.900</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, like, is it a more accurate score? Is it a higher signal grade? Because if the answer is yes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3641" target="_blank">01:00:41.300</a></span> | <span class="t">then you might actually just get higher, like, better results. Right? It's going to maximize</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3645" target="_blank">01:00:45.540</a></span> | <span class="t">whatever this grader says is good. And so if you can better tune what that means, like, what good means,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3650" target="_blank">01:00:50.740</a></span> | <span class="t">you will just get better results.

Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3658" target="_blank">01:00:58.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Can you tell us more about the RFT algorithm or some details about it?

No, I'm kidding, no. Um, I mean, it, I think, obviously, I can't share, like, the exact details, but, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3670" target="_blank">01:01:10.340</a></span> | <span class="t">like, it is, it is fundamentally, like, a very, very similar algorithm to the exact algorithm that we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3675" target="_blank">01:01:15.620</a></span> | <span class="t">used for 01 and 03. Right? Like, this reinforcement learning with language models is, like, exactly how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3681" target="_blank">01:01:21.540</a></span> | <span class="t">we did our reasoning models. Um, and we are putting as much out as we can. Right? And so, like, you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3688" target="_blank">01:01:28.660</a></span> | <span class="t">actually get these, like, really, really insane results, um, if you have clean data in, uh, in your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3695" target="_blank">01:01:35.060</a></span> | <span class="t">scenarios. Yeah. The reason, I really wanted to come with, like, a lot of really good examples. The reason</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3699" target="_blank">01:01:39.860</a></span> | <span class="t">I can't come with a lot is, like, A, a lot of them are, like, proprietary and I can't share.

Um, yeah. So, back there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3711" target="_blank">01:01:51.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So, our time is our most precious resource. How do you determine when fine-tuning is worth it versus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3722" target="_blank">01:02:02.260</a></span> | <span class="t">integrating with a new model or getting better data? Yeah. Maybe this is a little bit of a hot take,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3729" target="_blank">01:02:09.460</a></span> | <span class="t">but I would avoid fine-tuning until you need it. Um, right? Like, if you, um, if you can get away with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3740" target="_blank">01:02:20.820</a></span> | <span class="t">prompting, you should just use prompting. Yeah. Uh, and fine-tuning, the way you actually know -- sorry,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3748" target="_blank">01:02:28.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I blanked for a second -- um, you really want to evaluate. Right? Like, if you, if your evals are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3753" target="_blank">01:02:33.780</a></span> | <span class="t">showing that, like, you are reaching the limits of what you can accomplish through prompting,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3757" target="_blank">01:02:37.460</a></span> | <span class="t">but you know it's better to do pos -- you know it's possible to do better, then that's where you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3762" target="_blank">01:02:42.180</a></span> | <span class="t">pull out fine-tuning. If you have the data, if you have everything set up, um, it is a big upfront cost,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3768" target="_blank">01:02:48.660</a></span> | <span class="t">right?

What's happening on the OpenAI platform side when we do fine-tuning? So, is it generating, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3793" target="_blank">01:03:13.620</a></span> | <span class="t">a new set of weights, and then when you actually go to run inference, does it load those weights</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3798" target="_blank">01:03:18.660</a></span> | <span class="t">into memory and run on that, or, like, how does that work? Yeah. So, it is generating new weights.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3804" target="_blank">01:03:24.420</a></span> | <span class="t">It's generating this LoRa component, right? So, it's generating, like, this little piece that we use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3809" target="_blank">01:03:29.700</a></span> | <span class="t">with the models. Um, the rest of the weights are the same in the model. And so, what it does when you use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3813" target="_blank">01:03:33.940</a></span> | <span class="t">your inference is it loads in that part of the weights and then uses those. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3818" target="_blank">01:03:38.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I had a question on DPO. Um, how bad should your bad examples be? Like, with a joke, should it be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3826" target="_blank">01:03:46.740</a></span> | <span class="t">just barely bad? Like, it's non-obvious and so you're squeezing out nuance? Or should it just be,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3832" target="_blank">01:03:52.180</a></span> | <span class="t">like, really bad? I think you sort of answered your own question, right? If you make it too bad,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3837" target="_blank">01:03:57.380</a></span> | <span class="t">then you are learning, um, how to go from, like, really bad to, like, good, which might not be what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3844" target="_blank">01:04:04.260</a></span> | <span class="t">you want to teach the model. You might want to teach the model how to go from, like, mediocre to really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3848" target="_blank">01:04:08.020</a></span> | <span class="t">good, right? And so, yeah, like, you want to sort of mimic what you would expect to see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3853" target="_blank">01:04:13.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, or you want to think, like, what is that, um, delta? I think I haven't actually heard of too</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3861" target="_blank">01:04:21.620</a></span> | <span class="t">many other people doing, like, synthetic DPO with generated bad examples. Um, most often it's just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3869" target="_blank">01:04:29.380</a></span> | <span class="t">used for A/B tests because the signal from an A/B test is real and pure, right? The signal from synthetic DPO</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3877" target="_blank">01:04:37.940</a></span> | <span class="t">is as good as your imagination.

Like, the best would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3886" target="_blank">01:04:46.420</a></span> | <span class="t">be to, like, actually have people sit in front. I was thinking about doing this. Like, sending,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3891" target="_blank">01:04:51.060</a></span> | <span class="t">sending everyone, like, a little website and having you labeled a bunch of examples. But then I realized,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3894" target="_blank">01:04:54.340</a></span> | <span class="t">even if we did that, I wouldn't be able to train it live. Um, but that would be, that would be, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3898" target="_blank">01:04:58.740</a></span> | <span class="t">good, real signal, right? Perfect signal for DPO. Uh, yes. You're gonna have to yell.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3907" target="_blank">01:05:07.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I'm kind of curious about why RFT doesn't work for non-reasoning models. Like, say I wanted to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3913" target="_blank">01:05:13.700</a></span> | <span class="t">get a model that only produced output precisely 30% emojis. I don't think I could do that with DPO,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3920" target="_blank">01:05:20.900</a></span> | <span class="t">or could I? Uh, the question is why RFT doesn't work with non-reasoning models. What was the bit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3927" target="_blank">01:05:27.780</a></span> | <span class="t">about emojis? I missed that. Sorry. Um, if I wanted to get a non-reasoning model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3933" target="_blank">01:05:33.460</a></span> | <span class="t">to only output with 30% emojis exactly, I don't think I could do that with DPO, or correct.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3942" target="_blank">01:05:42.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, exactly is tough, but I would bet that you could get somewhat close. Um, I mean, it depends.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3952" target="_blank">01:05:52.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Are you trying to do, like, if it's a very specific constrained example?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3956" target="_blank">01:05:56.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, um, the main reason it doesn't work is because we don't support it.

You have a couple of questions, so, uh, so does, does custom GPT you have, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=3992" target="_blank">01:06:32.420</a></span> | <span class="t">does it use one of those fine tuning?

Okay. And second question is that, uh, for us,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4000" target="_blank">01:06:40.420</a></span> | <span class="t">certain applications, it's also important to have good thinking, COT, you know?

If an open source model does what you want, use that. But if you're, like, if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4127" target="_blank">01:08:47.300</a></span> | <span class="t">have the choice between, like, fine tuning an open source model, um, which involves all the, like, pitfalls</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4132" target="_blank">01:08:52.820</a></span> | <span class="t">that I just talked about, versus just, like, asking 4.0, like, with no fine tuning, it's, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4138" target="_blank">01:08:58.420</a></span> | <span class="t">one of the, is going to let you move faster.

So, I'd say always start with, always start with the biggest,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4150" target="_blank">01:09:10.740</a></span> | <span class="t">most expensive thing that'll make your thing work, and then work on getting more efficient.

Any-- Yeah, uh, I had a question here. Yeah. Uh, does the fine-tune API support different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4369" target="_blank">01:12:49.140</a></span> | <span class="t">modalities as well, or it's just text and-- Oh, we do have image fine-tuning. I forgot. Yes. Wow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4375" target="_blank">01:12:55.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. We have image fine-tuning, uh, and so you can do image input and, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4383" target="_blank">01:13:03.140</a></span> | <span class="t">I believe it's text output.

So, and then how do you use that work with the reasoning? And, and one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4404" target="_blank">01:13:24.180</a></span> | <span class="t">example is, like, if I have my personal experience, personal preference, should I do fine-tuning,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4409" target="_blank">01:13:29.540</a></span> | <span class="t">or should I kind of put it in context?

Fine-tuning, you want to, like, leave for, like, a later stage thing. You already-- you already</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4423" target="_blank">01:13:43.940</a></span> | <span class="t">have some data to, like, show one way or another. Um, in order to, like, give models new knowledge, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4429" target="_blank">01:13:49.460</a></span> | <span class="t">you have, like, all, like, different ways you can do rag and search. Um... Technically, when you fine-tune,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4437" target="_blank">01:13:57.300</a></span> | <span class="t">you can put in small amounts of new information into the models. But in general, you should treat it as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4442" target="_blank">01:14:02.900</a></span> | <span class="t">more of a methodology, right? Um, like, if you consider an algorithm data, like, in that it requires bits to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4451" target="_blank">01:14:11.780</a></span> | <span class="t">describe the procedure, you're sort of teaching that. But you can't really give it, like, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4458" target="_blank">01:14:18.580</a></span> | <span class="t">too, too much data. However, you-- it can-- it can learn a bit, right? Like, SFT starts to memorize</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4465" target="_blank">01:14:25.700</a></span> | <span class="t">certain things that you give it. Um, I just wouldn't say it's, like, the best way to give, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4473" target="_blank">01:14:33.380</a></span> | <span class="t">correct information or, like, correct, like, referenced information. I'd say maybe it's good to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4478" target="_blank">01:14:38.740</a></span> | <span class="t">like-- I would focus it more on formatting. You can use it, right? Like, I think, like, two years ago</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4484" target="_blank">01:14:44.340</a></span> | <span class="t">at this point, um, when we released, um, fine-tuning for GPT 3.5, one of the interesting things you can do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4491" target="_blank">01:14:51.860</a></span> | <span class="t">is, um, if you do retrieval, you can teach a model, like, with, um, like, embedding search,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4502" target="_blank">01:15:02.020</a></span> | <span class="t">and you need to, like, embed the query. First, sometimes you want to, like, transform the user's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4506" target="_blank">01:15:06.660</a></span> | <span class="t">query into something that looks more like your search results. Um, I think it's, like, hypothetical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4511" target="_blank">01:15:11.540</a></span> | <span class="t">document embeddings. Um, you can fine-tune a model to, like, do, like, essentially hallucinate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4518" target="_blank">01:15:18.820</a></span> | <span class="t">that better, right? Like, if you train it on, like, the actual outputs, uh, like, in your actual,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4523" target="_blank">01:15:23.380</a></span> | <span class="t">like, knowledge base, then it's more likely to output something that is in distribution, um, for your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4529" target="_blank">01:15:29.460</a></span> | <span class="t">knowledge base, and so you'll get, like, more direct mappings, if that makes sense. So, but it's, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4534" target="_blank">01:15:34.340</a></span> | <span class="t">you're not really teaching it too much new information. It's just helping you find-- it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4538" target="_blank">01:15:38.180</a></span> | <span class="t">giving you a better intuition to find it. Yeah, so, like, for a reasoning model, sometimes if I want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4543" target="_blank">01:15:43.460</a></span> | <span class="t">reference to custom definition or custom knowledge in certain domain, is it good to kind of combine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4550" target="_blank">01:15:50.260</a></span> | <span class="t">with reg and then generate that kind of training data, train with RL, or just, like, I guess that's,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4556" target="_blank">01:15:56.100</a></span> | <span class="t">in general, how to solve that problem? Um, for that case, uh, I would just let the model-- like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4562" target="_blank">01:16:02.660</a></span> | <span class="t">give the model some search functions. Oh. Like, let the model do search. Um, if you have explicit search</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4568" target="_blank">01:16:08.900</a></span> | <span class="t">steps that you do beforehand, um, then you can maybe fine-tune, like, specific parts,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4573" target="_blank">01:16:13.860</a></span> | <span class="t">but we, like, because search is, like, inherently a two-step process, it's like searching and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4578" target="_blank">01:16:18.980</a></span> | <span class="t">interpreting, you can't do that with reinforcement fine-tuning right now.

Uh, so for your question-- for your thing about the email classifier, did you do the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4590" target="_blank">01:16:30.900</a></span> | <span class="t">reinforcement learning just to kind of show us, like, a bad example? No, no, no, I really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4594" target="_blank">01:16:34.340</a></span> | <span class="t">hoped it worked. Oh, okay. Uh, that was me learning-- Well, it's so ambiguous, right? And then you were like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4598" target="_blank">01:16:38.180</a></span> | <span class="t">well, don't be ambiguous with it, and I'm like, okay, uh, okay. Yeah, yeah, no, thanks for calling</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4601" target="_blank">01:16:41.940</a></span> | <span class="t">me out publicly in a talk, but keep going. Well, I'm not trying to do that, but-- I'm joking,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4605" target="_blank">01:16:45.780</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm joking. For the supervised fine-tuning, that would have been the-- what was the correct answer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4610" target="_blank">01:16:50.740</a></span> | <span class="t">there, then? Like, supervised fine-tuning, given your data set? Um, so what I wanted to try and, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4617" target="_blank">01:16:57.540</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe if we have enough time, I'll, like, do a little bit of this, was, like, there are a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4622" target="_blank">01:17:02.020</a></span> | <span class="t">nuances around the email that I have, like, my preferences that are extremely low signal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4629" target="_blank">01:17:09.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, I might see it once. Like, I might get two very similar emails from two very similar, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4636" target="_blank">01:17:16.580</a></span> | <span class="t">people, uh, or, like, sources, and one I decide to, like, glance, and one I decide to, like, ignore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4643" target="_blank">01:17:23.860</a></span> | <span class="t">How is I going to learn that, right? Um, like, what I was imagining is, like, if you find cases that are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4650" target="_blank">01:17:30.420</a></span> | <span class="t">similar, and you could do that with embeddings, um, but that have different results, you might be able to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4656" target="_blank">01:17:36.020</a></span> | <span class="t">give them to, like, to give them to, like, a reasoning model, and be, like, you know, figure out what's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4659" target="_blank">01:17:39.620</a></span> | <span class="t">different here, and then make a note of it. And then you can compile this set of, like, principles,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4665" target="_blank">01:17:45.540</a></span> | <span class="t">essentially, that hopefully guide what it does. And so this is, like, what I would consider almost, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4671" target="_blank">01:17:51.380</a></span> | <span class="t">prompt tuning, where you, like, are finding the right context to provide the model based on a lot of examples.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4678" target="_blank">01:17:58.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, we can try in a little bit. That would be cool to see. Uh, like, I feel like embedding,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4684" target="_blank">01:18:04.340</a></span> | <span class="t">fine-tuning the embedding model itself, though, would almost be critical, then, to get,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4688" target="_blank">01:18:08.340</a></span> | <span class="t">right, for an individual, for an individualized, like... Why? What? How so? Why? Because embeddings</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4694" target="_blank">01:18:14.740</a></span> | <span class="t">naturally don't understand the nuance of, like, how you... Oh, no, no. I'm not saying using embeddings</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4699" target="_blank">01:18:19.060</a></span> | <span class="t">to find case, to, like, find the nuance. I'm saying using embeddings to find similar ones. Right,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4703" target="_blank">01:18:23.460</a></span> | <span class="t">but how would it know what's similar based on your preferences? Not based on my preference. Based on, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4709" target="_blank">01:18:29.700</a></span> | <span class="t">whatever embeddings similar... Like, does it, like... Finding similar in the naive sense, and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4716" target="_blank">01:18:36.260</a></span> | <span class="t">showing the model, like, naive similar cases that are actually different, and being like, look, these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4722" target="_blank">01:18:42.340</a></span> | <span class="t">are... The embedding model thought these were similar, but they're actually profoundly different. For some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4728" target="_blank">01:18:48.020</a></span> | <span class="t">nuanced reason, figure out what that is. Does that make sense? Yeah. Um, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4738" target="_blank">01:18:58.260</a></span> | <span class="t">I feel like people kind of want to see me try this. Okay. So, I did start trying this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4745" target="_blank">01:19:05.220</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm also going to try not to flash too much of the data, because this is my actual emails.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4752" target="_blank">01:19:12.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So, I have the email data set. I'm loading it. I have this, like, eval function. I have my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4762" target="_blank">01:19:22.260</a></span> | <span class="t">instructions, and then I just made a little, like, helper that... Essentially, I just did a little,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4767" target="_blank">01:19:27.940</a></span> | <span class="t">like, fancy evaluation loop where you can define an evaluator, and you can...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4776" target="_blank">01:19:36.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Where's my code? Oh. Yeah. I'm sorry. The eval model takes in a run function that just returns a result.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4786" target="_blank">01:19:46.500</a></span> | <span class="t">This is where I'm going to pass the model. It takes an evaluate function, and then a data set of workers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4791" target="_blank">01:19:51.300</a></span> | <span class="t">This is just like a generic version of the other function I implemented. Cool. And let's see how it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4797" target="_blank">01:19:57.620</a></span> | <span class="t">was doing. So, you know, I have this prompt. Try it with all the models. And what am I getting right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4805" target="_blank">01:20:05.780</a></span> | <span class="t">now? For a mini, it's 58%, 51% worse, 56, 57. So, this kind of goes to show there's no signal to learn</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4815" target="_blank">01:20:15.380</a></span> | <span class="t">right now. Right? It's kind of random. Or, like, there's very little signal there. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4823" target="_blank">01:20:23.300</a></span> | <span class="t">let's think about this. How would you do this sort of prompt tuning?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4826" target="_blank">01:20:26.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe even without the embedding models. We can, like, do these... Oh, I think I started writing an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4835" target="_blank">01:20:35.860</a></span> | <span class="t">algorithm somewhere. Where is it? Ha! There we go. Look at that. So, this was sort of the idea that I had for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4844" target="_blank">01:20:44.580</a></span> | <span class="t">fine tuning -- for prompt tuning -- was, like, run a forward pass, then sample from that training</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4854" target="_blank">01:20:54.260</a></span> | <span class="t">subset -- or, sorry, split up into mini-batches. Run a forward pass.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4858" target="_blank">01:20:58.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Sorry. Split into mini-batches, each of which has a training subset and a test subset. Run a forward pass on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4870" target="_blank">01:21:10.180</a></span> | <span class="t">training subset. And then reason over it to see how it could have done better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4874" target="_blank">01:21:14.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And then take that -- put it back in the prompt, and then use that -- run it forward again on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4881" target="_blank">01:21:21.140</a></span> | <span class="t">test subset. And then update the prompt. And keep going. Does this make sense? I don't know. I'm kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4886" target="_blank">01:21:26.740</a></span> | <span class="t">of, like, coming up with this on the spot. So, we can see how it goes. Before I jump into this, I want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4891" target="_blank">01:21:31.940</a></span> | <span class="t">make sure there's no more questions. If I, like, lose myself here. No? Okay. People want to see me?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4899" target="_blank">01:21:39.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So, you know, what are we going to do? Let's do training loop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4915" target="_blank">01:21:55.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And -- should we just do this? Let's do one run, right? So, like, we have some, like, mini-batch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4936" target="_blank">01:22:16.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we have training and -- like, train test. Yeah. Now, if we have that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4948" target="_blank">01:22:28.820</a></span> | <span class="t">then I want to run a forward pass. So, for --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4960" target="_blank">01:22:40.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Is it just evaluate?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4961" target="_blank">01:22:41.700</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll do this in a lazy way right now. So, you know, sample in train. Let's do results.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=4972" target="_blank">01:22:52.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.

We sample train.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=5009" target="_blank">01:23:29.140</a></span> | <span class="t">We should -- Yeah.

Should we print what one of these -- So, we have -- let's do this, like, more accurately. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=5019" target="_blank">01:23:39.060</a></span> | <span class="t">the samples have an action, and they have a text.

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=6116" target="_blank">01:41:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Can I show examples that have worked for this technique?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=6123" target="_blank">01:42:03.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, so you're asking -- are the numbers moving?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=6143" target="_blank">01:42:23.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Not significantly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=6144" target="_blank">01:42:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=6145" target="_blank">01:42:25.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to call it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=6146" target="_blank">01:42:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">This doesn't work right now, but it's good enough to, like, be an example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=6149" target="_blank">01:42:29.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I think to answer your question about, you know, what are the good techniques for prompt engineering?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=6155" target="_blank">01:42:35.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, if I can share some.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=6156" target="_blank">01:42:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I think they've just been changing so much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=6158" target="_blank">01:42:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">There's many, many, many, like, prompt engineering guides.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=6160" target="_blank">01:42:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And, like, what you would want to do is, like -- I guess you're asking both about prompt engineering, but maybe also something like this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=6167" target="_blank">01:42:47.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Prompt engineering, there's so many resources.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=6169" target="_blank">01:42:49.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I'd say the biggest one is just be clear and don't have any, like, contradictions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=6173" target="_blank">01:42:53.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And then a few shared examples are really, really good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=6177" target="_blank">01:42:57.880</a></span> | <span class="t">For something like this, I'm, like, making this up as we go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=6180" target="_blank">01:43:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I think, like -- again, I think the shape of this is something that can make sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=6185" target="_blank">01:43:05.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I would have been very surprised if I would have gotten any, like, good results.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=6190" target="_blank">01:43:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe I'll stay, like, a few minutes after trying to get this work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=6194" target="_blank">01:43:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But, yeah, question back there?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=6197" target="_blank">01:43:17.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Can you explain what you're doing?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=6200" target="_blank">01:43:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=6201" target="_blank">01:43:21.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So, the question is, can I explain what the hell I'm doing here?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=6207" target="_blank">01:43:27.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the idea here is to -- instead of tuning the model itself, tuning the prompt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=6218" target="_blank">01:43:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And, specifically, tuning a subsection of the prompt that I'm calling notes that essentially, hopefully, contains, like, jots about the emails that it's seen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=6230" target="_blank">01:43:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And anything that they might have found unintuitive about classifying that email.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=6236" target="_blank">01:43:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe that's something I should include in the prompt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=6238" target="_blank">01:43:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, the hope is that as it sees more emails, like, with the -- what it actually classified it as and what it was supposed to classify it as, by using these reasoning models,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=6252" target="_blank">01:44:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">hopefully extract some, like, explicit insights of, like, oh, you know, like, maybe Elon, like, wants to, like -- if he sees, like, a package has been delivered -- this one is probably glance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=6266" target="_blank">01:44:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">This is what I mean.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=6267" target="_blank">01:44:27.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, my data was very noisy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=6268" target="_blank">01:44:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But, like, he will want to, like, glance at, like -- oh, I said ignore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=6273" target="_blank">01:44:33.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, I might want to glance at this instead of, like, archiving.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=6279" target="_blank">01:44:39.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=6280" target="_blank">01:44:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, like -- but the question is, like, but why?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=6282" target="_blank">01:44:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=6283" target="_blank">01:44:43.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I didn't say why.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=6284" target="_blank">01:44:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm just saying what the correct answer is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=6286" target="_blank">01:44:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is why I thought RFT might be -- might be good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=6289" target="_blank">01:44:49.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But, like, this is way too noisy and subjective.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=6291" target="_blank">01:44:51.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But that doesn't mean you can't use reasoning models to still extract interesting insights.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=6295" target="_blank">01:44:55.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So, the idea would be, like, give enough examples of both successes and failures that the model itself has done to a reasoning model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=6306" target="_blank">01:45:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And have it come up with, like, notes or techniques that the model can use to hopefully improve the next time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=6314" target="_blank">01:45:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so the question is, like, can I use this to identify pieces of information that are missing?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=6332" target="_blank">01:45:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think, yes, absolutely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=6334" target="_blank">01:45:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that's, like, very important for -- even, like, if you do want to fine-tune, but even if you don't, like, this approach can, like, tell you a little bit about your data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=6343" target="_blank">01:45:43.880</a></span> | <span class="t">As well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=6344" target="_blank">01:45:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=6345" target="_blank">01:45:45.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So, like, just -- it's like having someone read through it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=6348" target="_blank">01:45:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And, like, write these things.</span></div><div

this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfaLQqfXqPA&t=6358" target="_blank">01:45:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">You have now seen two failures
