works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=86" target="_blank">00:01:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So what we call it, ears have a technical name.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=89" target="_blank">00:01:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">That technical name is oracles, but more often they're called pinna.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The pinna's P-I-N-N-A, pinna.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And the pinna's of your ears, this outer part that is made of cartilage</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=102" target="_blank">00:01:42.600</a></span> | <span class="t">and stuff is arranged such that it can capture sound in the best way for your head size.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=111" target="_blank">00:01:51.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So the shape of these ears that we have is such that it amplifies high-frequency sounds,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=117" target="_blank">00:01:57.980</a></span> | <span class="t">high-frequency sounds, as the name suggests, are the squeakier stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have low-frequency sounds and high-frequency sounds and everything in between.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And those sound waves, for those of you that don't maybe fully conceptualize sound waves,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.100</a></span> | <span class="t">are literally just fluctuations or shifts in the way that air is moving toward your ear and through space.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.160</a></span> | <span class="t">In the same way that water can have waves, air can have waves, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's reverberation of air.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Those come in through your ears and you have what's called your eardrum.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And on the inside of your eardrum, there's a little bony thing that's shaped like a little hammer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So attached to that eardrum, which can move back and forth like a drum.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.420</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like a little membrane.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">You've got this hammer attached to it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And that hammer has three parts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.060</a></span> | <span class="t">For those of you that want to know, those three parts are called malleus, incus, and stapes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.760</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like, but basically you can just think about it as a hammer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So you've got this eardrum and then a hammer, and then that hammer has to hammer on something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And what it does is it hammers on a little coiled piece of tissue that we call the cochlea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So this snail-shaped structure in your inner ear is where sound gets converted into electrical signals that the brain can understand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, the cochlea at one end is more rigid than the other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So one part can move really easily and the other part doesn't move very easily.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And that turns out to be very important for decoding or separating sounds that are low frequency and sounds that are of high frequency, like a shriek or a shrill.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's because within that little coiled thing we call the cochlea, you have all these tiny little what are called hair cells.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, they look like hairs, but they're not at all related to the hairs on your head or elsewhere on your body.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.320</a></span> | <span class="t">They're just shaped like hairs, so we call them hair cells, those hair cells if they move, send signals into the brain that a particular sound is in our environment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, this should stagger your mind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">If it doesn't already, it should, because what this means is that everything that's happening around us, whether or not it's music or voices, all of that is being broken down into its component parts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And then your brain is making sense of what it means.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Your cochlea essentially acts as a prism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.820</a></span> | <span class="t">It takes all the sound in your environment and it splits up those sounds into different frequencies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the brain takes that information and puts it back together and makes sense of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So those hair cells in each of your two cochlea, 'cause you have two ears, you also have two cochlea,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">send little wires, what we call axons, that convey their patterns of activity into the brain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And there are a number of different stations within the brain that information arrives at before it gets up to the parts of your brain where you are consciously aware.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And there is a good reason for that, which is that more important than knowing what you're hearing, you need to know where it's coming from.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And our visual system can help with that, but our auditory and our visual system collaborate to help us find and locate the position of things in space.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">That should come as no surprise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=328" target="_blank">00:05:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">If you hear somebody talking off to your right, you tend to turn to your right, not to your left.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=333" target="_blank">00:05:33.960</a></span> | <span class="t">If you see somebody's mouth moving in front of you, you tend to assume that the sound is going to come from right in front of you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Disruptions in this auditory hearing and visual matching are actually the basis of what's called the ventriloquism effect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.960</a></span> | <span class="t">The ventriloquism effect can basically be described in simple terms as when you essentially think that a sound is coming from a location that it's not actually coming from.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=361" target="_blank">00:06:01.960</a></span> | <span class="t">The way you know where things are coming from, what direction a car or a bus or a person is coming from is because the sound lands in one ear before the other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=372" target="_blank">00:06:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And you have stations in your brain and meaning you have neurons in your brain that calculate the difference in time of arrival for those sound waves in your right versus your left ear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=382" target="_blank">00:06:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And if they arrive at the same time, you assume that thing is making noise right in front of you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">If it's off to your right, you assume it's over on your right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=391" target="_blank">00:06:31.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And if the sound arrives first to your left ear, you assume quite correctly that the thing is coming toward your left ear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But what about up and down?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=399" target="_blank">00:06:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">If you think about it, a sound coming from above is going to land on your right ear and your left ear at the same time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=404" target="_blank">00:06:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">A sound from below is going to land on your right ear and your left ear at the same time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=409" target="_blank">00:06:49.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So the way that we know where things are in terms of what's called elevation, where they are in the up and down plane is by the frequencies, the shape of your ears actually modifies the sound depending on whether or not it's coming straight at you from the floor or from high above.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=430" target="_blank">00:07:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, this all happens very, very fast in a subconscious, but now you know why if people really want to hear something, they make a cup around their ear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=441" target="_blank">00:07:21.960</a></span> | <span class="t">They essentially make their ear into more of a fennec fox type ear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=445" target="_blank">00:07:25.960</a></span> | <span class="t">If you've ever seen those cute little fennec fox things, they have these big spiky ears.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=449" target="_blank">00:07:29.960</a></span> | <span class="t">They kind of look like a French bulldog, although they're kind of Fox version version of the French bulldog.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=454" target="_blank">00:07:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">They have these big, big, tall ears, and they have excellent sound localization.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=458" target="_blank">00:07:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And so when people lean in with their ear like that, with their hand like this, if you're listening to this, I'm just cupping my hand at my ear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=465" target="_blank">00:07:45.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm giving myself a bigger pinna.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=467" target="_blank">00:07:47.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=468" target="_blank">00:07:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And if I do it on the left side, I do this side.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=470" target="_blank">00:07:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And if I really want to hear something, I do it on both sides.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=473" target="_blank">00:07:53.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=474" target="_blank">00:07:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So this isn't just gesturing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=475" target="_blank">00:07:55.960</a></span> | <span class="t">This actually serves a mechanical role.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=477" target="_blank">00:07:57.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And actually, if you want to hear where things are coming from with a much greater degree of accuracy, this can actually help because you're capturing sound waves and funneling them better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=488" target="_blank">00:08:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So now I want to shift to talking about ways to leverage your hearing system, your auditory system, so that you can learn anything, not just auditory information, but anything faster.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=499" target="_blank">00:08:19.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I get a lot of questions about so-called binaural beats.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=504" target="_blank">00:08:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Binaural beats, as their name suggests, involve playing one frequency of sound to one ear and a different frequency of sound to the other ear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=514" target="_blank">00:08:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And the idea is that the brain will take those two frequencies of sound.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=520" target="_blank">00:08:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And because the pathways that bring information from the ears into the brain eventually crossover, they actually share that information with both sides of the brain,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=529" target="_blank">00:08:49.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that the brain will average that information and come up with a sort of intermediate frequency.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=535" target="_blank">00:08:55.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And the rationale is that those intermediate frequencies place the brain into a state that is better for learning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=542" target="_blank">00:09:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And when I say better for learning, I want to be precise about what I mean.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=547" target="_blank">00:09:07.960</a></span> | <span class="t">That could mean more focus for encoding or bringing the information in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=553" target="_blank">00:09:13.960</a></span> | <span class="t">As you may have heard me say before, we have to be alert and focused in order to learn.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=559" target="_blank">00:09:19.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So can binaural beats make us more focused?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=562" target="_blank">00:09:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Can binaural beats allow us to relax more if we're anxious?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=566" target="_blank">00:09:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So what are the scientific data say about binaural beats?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=569" target="_blank">00:09:29.960</a></span> | <span class="t">The science on binaural beats is actually quite extensive and very precise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=574" target="_blank">00:09:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So sound waves are measured typically in hertz or kilohertz.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=579" target="_blank">00:09:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I know many of you aren't familiar with thinking about things in hertz or kilohertz.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=582" target="_blank">00:09:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But again, just remember those waves on a pond, those ripples on a pond.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=587" target="_blank">00:09:47.960</a></span> | <span class="t">If they're close together, then they are of high frequency.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=592" target="_blank">00:09:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And if they're far apart, then they are low frequency.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=594" target="_blank">00:09:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So if it's many more kilohertz, then it's much higher frequency than if it's fewer hertz or killer hertz.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=599" target="_blank">00:09:59.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you may have heard of these things as delta waves or theta waves or alpha waves or beta waves, et cetera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=606" target="_blank">00:10:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Delta waves would be big, slow waves, a low frequency.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=609" target="_blank">00:10:09.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And indeed, there is quality evidence from peer reviewed studies that tell us that delta waves like one to four hertz.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=619" target="_blank">00:10:19.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So very low frequency sounds can help in the transition to sleep and for staying asleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=625" target="_blank">00:10:25.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And that theta rhythms, which are more like four to eight hertz, can bring the brain into a state of subtle sleep or meditation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=636" target="_blank">00:10:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So deeply relaxed, but not fully asleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=638" target="_blank">00:10:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And you'll find evidence that alpha waves eight to 13 hertz can increase alertness to a moderate level.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=644" target="_blank">00:10:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a great state for the brain to be in for recall of existing information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=650" target="_blank">00:10:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=651" target="_blank">00:10:51.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And that beta waves 15 to 20 hertz are great for bringing the brain into focus states for sustained thought or for incorporating new information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=662" target="_blank">00:11:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And especially gamma waves, the highest frequency, the most frequent ripples of sound, so to speak, 32 to 100 hertz for learning and problem solving.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=671" target="_blank">00:11:11.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Here we're talking about the use of binaural beats in order to increase our level of alertness or our level of calmness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=680" target="_blank">00:11:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Now that's important to underscore because it's not that there's something fundamentally important about the binaural beats.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=687" target="_blank">00:11:27.960</a></span> | <span class="t">They are yet another way of bringing the brain into states of deep relaxation through low frequency sound or highly alert states for focused learning with more high frequency sound.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=699" target="_blank">00:11:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">They're effective, but it's not that they're uniquely special for learning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=705" target="_blank">00:11:45.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just that they can help some people bring their brain into the state that allows them to learn better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=712" target="_blank">00:11:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">There's very good evidence for anxiety reduction from the use of binaural beats.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=718" target="_blank">00:11:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And what's interesting is the anxiety reduction seems to be most effective when the binaural beats are bringing the brain into delta.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=730" target="_blank">00:12:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So those slow big waves like sleep, theta and alpha states.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=735" target="_blank">00:12:15.960</a></span> | <span class="t">There's good evidence that binaural beats can be used to treat pain, chronic pain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=739" target="_blank">00:12:19.960</a></span> | <span class="t">The real boost from binaural beats appears to be for anxiety reduction and pain reduction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=745" target="_blank">00:12:25.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Many people like binaural beats and say that they benefit from them, especially while studying or learning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=751" target="_blank">00:12:31.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I think part of the reason for that relates to the ability to channel our focus when we have some background noise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=759" target="_blank">00:12:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is something I also get asked about a lot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=763" target="_blank">00:12:43.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Is it better to listen to music and have background noise when studying or is it better to have complete silence?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=768" target="_blank">00:12:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, there's actually a quite good literature on this as well, but not so much as it relates to binaural beats, but rather whether or not people are listening to music.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=777" target="_blank">00:12:57.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So-called white noise, brown noise, believe it or not, there's white noise and there's brown noise, there's even pink noise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=785" target="_blank">00:13:05.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to be very clear that white noise has been shown to really enhance brain states for learning in certain individuals, in particular in adults.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=796" target="_blank">00:13:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But white noise actually can have a detrimental effect on auditory learning and maybe even the development of the auditory system in very young children, in particular in infants.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=806" target="_blank">00:13:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So first I'd like to talk about the beneficial effects of white noise on learning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=811" target="_blank">00:13:31.960</a></span> | <span class="t">There are some really excellent studies on this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=814" target="_blank">00:13:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">The first one that I'd like to just highlight is one that's entitled low intensity white noise improves performance in auditory working memory task and fMRI study.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=825" target="_blank">00:13:45.960</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a study that explored whether or not learning could be enhanced by playing white noise in the background,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=834" target="_blank">00:13:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">but the strength of the study is that they looked at some of the underlying neural circuitry and the activation of the neural circuitry in these people as they did the learning task.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=844" target="_blank">00:14:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And what it essentially illustrates is that white noise provided that white noise is of low enough intensity, meaning not super loud.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=853" target="_blank">00:14:13.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It actually could enhance learning to a significant degree.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=856" target="_blank">00:14:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And this has been shown now for a huge number of different types of learning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=862" target="_blank">00:14:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I was very relieved to find, or I should say excited to find this study published in

noise improves learning by modulating activity in dopaminergic midbrain regions and the right superior temporal sulcus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=881" target="_blank">00:14:41.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't expect you to know what the dopamine midbrain region is, but if you're like me, you probably took highlighted notice of the word dopaminergic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=890" target="_blank">00:14:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Dopamine is a neuromodulator, meaning it's a chemical that's released in our brain and body, but mostly in our brain that modulates, meaning controls the likelihood that certain brain areas will be active and other brain areas won't be active.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=905" target="_blank">00:15:05.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And dopamine is associated with motivation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=907" target="_blank">00:15:07.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Dopamine is associated with craving.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=909" target="_blank">00:15:09.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But what's so interesting to me is that it appears that white noise itself can raise the, what we call the basal, the baseline levels of dopamine that are being released from this area, the substantia nigra.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=922" target="_blank">00:15:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So now we're starting to get a more full picture of how particular sounds in our environment can increase learning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=932" target="_blank">00:15:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's in part, I believe through the release of dopamine from substantia nigra.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=938" target="_blank">00:15:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm not trying to shift you away from binaural beats if that's your thing, but it does appear that turning on white noise at a low level, but not too loud can allow you to learn better because of the ways that it's modulating your brain chemistry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=953" target="_blank">00:15:53.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So what about white noise and hearing loss in development?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=957" target="_blank">00:15:57.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I know a lot of people with children have these kind of noise machines like sound waves and things like that, that help the kids sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=963" target="_blank">00:16:03.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And look, I think kids getting good sleep and parents getting good sleep is vital to physical and mental health and family health.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=971" target="_blank">00:16:11.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So I certainly sympathize with those needs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=977" target="_blank">00:16:17.960</a></span> | <span class="t">However, there are data that indicate that white noise during development can be detrimental to the auditory system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=985" target="_blank">00:16:25.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't want to frighten any parents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=986" target="_blank">00:16:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">If you played white noise to your kids, this doesn't mean that their auditory system or their speech patterns are going to be disrupted, or that their interpretation of speech is going to be disrupted forever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=995" target="_blank">00:16:35.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But there are data published in the journal science some years ago showing that when they exposed very young animals to this white noise, it actually disrupted the maps of the auditory world within the brain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1010" target="_blank">00:16:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So auditory information goes up into our cortex, into essentially the outside portion of our brain that's responsible for all of our higher level cognition, our planning, our decision-making, et cetera, creativity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1025" target="_blank">00:17:05.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And up there, we have what are called tonotopic maps.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1029" target="_blank">00:17:09.960</a></span> | <span class="t">What's a tonotopic map?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1030" target="_blank">00:17:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, remember the cochlea, how it's coiled, and at one end, it responds to high frequencies, and the other end, it responds to low frequencies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1037" target="_blank">00:17:17.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Sort of like a piano.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1039" target="_blank">00:17:19.960</a></span> | <span class="t">In the auditory system, we have what are called tonotopic maps, where frequency, high frequency to low frequency, and everything in between is organized in a very systematic way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1050" target="_blank">00:17:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, our experience of life from the time we're a baby until the time that we die is not systematic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1057" target="_blank">00:17:37.960</a></span> | <span class="t">We don't hear low frequencies at one part of the room or at one part of the day, and high frequencies at another part of the room, another part of the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1063" target="_blank">00:17:43.960</a></span> | <span class="t">They're all intermixed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1065" target="_blank">00:17:45.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you remember, the cochlea separates them out just like a prism of light separates out the different wavelengths of light, the cochlea separates out the different frequencies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1075" target="_blank">00:17:55.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And the developing brain takes those separated out frequencies and learns this relationship between itself, meaning the child, and the outside world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1088" target="_blank">00:18:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">White noise essentially contains no tonotopic information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1093" target="_blank">00:18:13.960</a></span> | <span class="t">The frequencies are all intermixed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1095" target="_blank">00:18:15.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just noise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1097" target="_blank">00:18:17.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So, one of the reasons why hearing a lot of white noise during development for long periods of time can be detrimental to the development of the auditory system is that these tonotopic maps don't form normally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1110" target="_blank">00:18:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">At least they don't in experimental animals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1112" target="_blank">00:18:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, the reason I'm raising this is that many people I know, in particular friends who have small children, they say, "I want to use a white noise machine while I sleep, but is it okay for my baby to use a white noise machine?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1129" target="_blank">00:18:49.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And I consulted with various people, scientists about this, and they said, "Well, you know, the baby is also hearing the parents' voices and is hearing music and is hearing the dog bark."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1140" target="_blank">00:19:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it's not the only thing they're hearing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1142" target="_blank">00:19:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">However, every single person that I consulted with said, "But, you know, there's neuroplasticity during sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1149" target="_blank">00:19:09.960</a></span> | <span class="t">That's when the kid is sleeping."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1151" target="_blank">00:19:11.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And I don't know that you'd want to expose a child to white noise the entire night because it might degrade that tonotopic map.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1160" target="_blank">00:19:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It might not destroy it, might not eliminate it, but it could make it a little less clear, like sort of taking the keys on the piano and taping a few of them together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1170" target="_blank">00:19:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Once your auditory system has formed, once it's established these tonotopic maps, then the presence of background white noise should not be a problem at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1179" target="_blank">00:19:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, it shouldn't be a problem at all because you're also not attending to it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1183" target="_blank">00:19:43.960</a></span> | <span class="t">The idea is that it's playing at a low enough volume that you kind of forget it in the background and that it's supporting learning by bringing your brain into a heightened state of alertness and especially this heightened state of dopamine, dopaminergic activation of the brain, which will make it easier to learn faster and easier to learn the information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1200" target="_blank">00:20:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So, now I want to talk about auditory learning and actually how you can get better at learning information that you hear, not just information that you see on a page.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1209" target="_blank">00:20:09.960</a></span> | <span class="t">or motor skill learning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1211" target="_blank">00:20:11.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So, there's a phenomenon called the cocktail party effect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1215" target="_blank">00:20:15.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, even if you've never been to a cocktail party, you've experienced and participated in what's called the cocktail party effect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1222" target="_blank">00:20:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">The cocktail party effect is where you are in an environment that's rich with sound, many sound waves coming from many different sources, many different things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1230" target="_blank">00:20:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So, in a city, in a classroom, in a car that contains people having various conversations, you somehow need to be able to attend to specific components of those sound waves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1242" target="_blank">00:20:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Meaning you need to hear certain people and not others.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1245" target="_blank">00:20:45.960</a></span> | <span class="t">You and your brain are exquisitely good at creating a cone of auditory attention, a narrow band of attention with which you can extract the information you care about and wipe away or erase all the rest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1263" target="_blank">00:21:03.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, this takes work, it takes attention.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1266" target="_blank">00:21:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the reasons why you might come home from a loud gathering, maybe a stadium, a sports event or a cocktail party for that matter, and feel just exhausted is because if you are listening to conversations there or trying to listen to those conversations while watching the game, it takes attentional effort.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1282" target="_blank">00:21:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And the brain uses up a lot of energy just at rest, but it uses up even more energy when you are paying strong attention to something, literally caloric energy, burning up things like glucose, et cetera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1295" target="_blank">00:21:35.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Even if you're ketogenic, it's burning up energy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1298" target="_blank">00:21:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So the cocktail party effect has been studied extensively in the field of neuroscience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1303" target="_blank">00:21:43.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And we now know at a mechanistic level, how one accomplishes this feat of attending to certain sounds, despite the fact that we are being bombarded with all sorts of other sounds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1315" target="_blank">00:21:55.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So there are a couple of ways that we do this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1317" target="_blank">00:21:57.960</a></span> | <span class="t">First of all, much as with our visual system, we can expand or contract our visual field of view.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1328" target="_blank">00:22:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, we can expand and contract our auditory field of view, so to speak, or our auditory window.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1339" target="_blank">00:22:19.960</a></span> | <span class="t">We can really hear one person or a small number of people amidst a huge background of chatter, because we pay attention to the onset of words, but also to the offset of words.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1353" target="_blank">00:22:33.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So one of the more common phenomena that I think we all experience is you go to a party and, or you meet somebody new and you say, hi, I would say, hi, I'm Andrew.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1364" target="_blank">00:22:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And they'd say, hi, I'm Jeff, for instance, great, great to meet you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1367" target="_blank">00:22:47.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And then a minute later, I can't remember the guy's name.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1370" target="_blank">00:22:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, is it because I don't care what his name is?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1372" target="_blank">00:22:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">No, somehow the presence of other auditory information interfered.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1376" target="_blank">00:22:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not that my mind was necessarily someplace else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1379" target="_blank">00:22:59.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It's that the signal to noise, as we say, wasn't high enough.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1383" target="_blank">00:23:03.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Somehow the way he said it, or the way it landed on my ears, which is really all that matters, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1390" target="_blank">00:23:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">When, when it comes down to learning is such that it just didn't achieve high enough signal to noise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1397" target="_blank">00:23:17.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So the next time you ask somebody's name, remember, listen to the onset of what they say and the offsets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1402" target="_blank">00:23:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It would be paying attention to the J in Jeff, and it would be paying attention to that in F in Jeff, excuse me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1410" target="_blank">00:23:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1411" target="_blank">00:23:31.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And chances are, you'll be able to remember that name.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1414" target="_blank">00:23:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Now I do acknowledge that trying to learn every word in a sentence by paying attention to its onset and offset could actually be kind of disruptive to the learning process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1424" target="_blank">00:23:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So this would be more for specific attention using the attentional system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1429" target="_blank">00:23:49.960</a></span> | <span class="t">We can actually learn much faster and we can actually activate neuroplasticity in the adult brain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1436" target="_blank">00:23:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Something that's very challenging to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1438" target="_blank">00:23:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And that the auditory system is one of the main ways in which we can access neuroplasticity more broadly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1445" target="_blank">00:24:05.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I'd like to now talk about balance and our sense of balance, which is controlled by, believe it or not, our ears and things in our ears, as well as by our brain and elements of our spinal cord.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1459" target="_blank">00:24:19.960</a></span> | <span class="t">The reason why we're talking about balance and how to get better at balancing in the episode about hearing is that all the goodies that are going to allow you to do that are in your ears.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1470" target="_blank">00:24:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">They're also in your brain, but they're mostly in your ears.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1475" target="_blank">00:24:35.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So as you recall from the beginning of this episode, you have two cochlea, cochleas that are one on each side of your head.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1484" target="_blank">00:24:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's a little spiral snail shape thing that converts sound waves into electrical signals that the rest of your brain can understand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1491" target="_blank">00:24:51.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Right next to those, you have what are called semi-circular canals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1496" target="_blank">00:24:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">The semi-circular canals can be best visualized as thinking about three hula hoops with marbles in them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1503" target="_blank">00:25:03.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So imagine that you have a hula hoop and it's not filled with marbles all the way around.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1509" target="_blank">00:25:09.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just got some marbles down there at the base.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1512" target="_blank">00:25:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1513" target="_blank">00:25:13.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you were to move that hula hoop around, one of those hula hoops is positioned vertically with respect to gravity, but basically it's upright.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1523" target="_blank">00:25:23.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Another one of those hula hoops is basically at a 90 degree angle, basically parallel to the floor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1532" target="_blank">00:25:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're standing up right now, if you're seated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1535" target="_blank">00:25:35.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1536" target="_blank">00:25:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And the other one is kind of tilted about 45 degrees in between those.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1542" target="_blank">00:25:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, why is the system there?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1545" target="_blank">00:25:45.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, those marbles within each one of those hula hoops can move around, but they'll only move around if your head moves in a particular way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1554" target="_blank">00:25:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And there are three planes or three ways that your head can move.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1558" target="_blank">00:25:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Your head can move up and down like I'm nodding right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1562" target="_blank">00:26:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's called pitch or I can shake my head.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1565" target="_blank">00:26:05.960</a></span> | <span class="t">No side to side.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1566" target="_blank">00:26:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">That's called yaw.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1568" target="_blank">00:26:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there's roll tilting the head from side to side, the way that a cute puppy might look at you from side to side.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1576" target="_blank">00:26:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Pitch yaw and roll are the movements of the head in each of the three major planes of motion, as we say.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1582" target="_blank">00:26:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And each one of those causes those marbles to move in one or two of the various hula hoops.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1591" target="_blank">00:26:31.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1592" target="_blank">00:26:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">They aren't actually marbles, by the way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1593" target="_blank">00:26:33.960</a></span> | <span class="t">These are little, little, kind of like little stones, basically little calcium like deposits.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1601" target="_blank">00:26:41.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And when they roll back and forth, they deflect little hairs, little hair cells that aren't like the hair cells that we use for measuring sound waves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1611" target="_blank">00:26:51.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But they're basically rolling past these little hair cells and causing them to deflect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1616" target="_blank">00:26:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And when they deflect downward, the neurons, because hair cells are neurons, send information up to the brain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1624" target="_blank">00:27:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So if I move my head like this, there's a physical movement of these little stones in this hula hoop, as I'm referring to it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1632" target="_blank">00:27:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But they deflect these hairs, send those hairs, which are neurons, those hair cells send information off to the brain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1639" target="_blank">00:27:19.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Any animal that has a jaw has this so-called balance system, which we call the vestibular system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1644" target="_blank">00:27:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the more important things to know about the vestibular, the balance system, is that it works together with the visual system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1653" target="_blank">00:27:33.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's say I hear something off to my left and I swing my head over to the left to see what it is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1659" target="_blank">00:27:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">There are two sources of information about where my head is relative to my body.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1664" target="_blank">00:27:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And I need to know that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1665" target="_blank">00:27:45.960</a></span> | <span class="t">First of all, when I quickly move my head to the side, those little stones, as I'm referring to them, they quickly...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1673" target="_blank">00:27:53.960</a></span> | <span class="t">activate those hair cells in that one semicircular canal and send a signal off to my brain that my head just moved to the side.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1682" target="_blank">00:28:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But also visual information slid past my field of view.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1686" target="_blank">00:28:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I didn't have to think about it, but just slid past my field of view.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1689" target="_blank">00:28:09.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And when those two signals combine, my eyes then lock to a particular location.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1696" target="_blank">00:28:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, if this is at all complicated, you can actually uncouple these things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1701" target="_blank">00:28:21.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It's very easy to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1703" target="_blank">00:28:23.960</a></span> | <span class="t">If you get the opportunity, you can do this safely wherever you are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1705" target="_blank">00:28:25.960</a></span> | <span class="t">You're going to stand up and you're going to look forward about 10, 12 feet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1709" target="_blank">00:28:29.960</a></span> | <span class="t">You're going to pick a point on a wall, stand on one leg and lift up the other leg.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1715" target="_blank">00:28:35.960</a></span> | <span class="t">You can bend your knee if you like, and just look off into the distance about 10, 12 feet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1721" target="_blank">00:28:41.960</a></span> | <span class="t">If you can do that, if you can stand on one leg, now close your eyes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1724" target="_blank">00:28:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Chances are you're going to suddenly feel what scientists call postural sway.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1730" target="_blank">00:28:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It is very hard to balance with your eyes closed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1734" target="_blank">00:28:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">You might think, well, and if you think about that, it's like, why is that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1737" target="_blank">00:28:57.960</a></span> | <span class="t">That's crazy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1738" target="_blank">00:28:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Why would it be that it's hard to balance with your eyes closed?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1740" target="_blank">00:29:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, information about the visual world also feeds back onto this vestibular system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1746" target="_blank">00:29:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So the vestibular system informs your vision and tells you where to move your eyes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1750" target="_blank">00:29:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And your eyes and their positioning tell your balance system, your vestibular system, how it should function.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1756" target="_blank">00:29:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So up until now, I've been talking about balance only in the static sense, like standing on one leg, for instance, but that's a very artificial situation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1764" target="_blank">00:29:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Even though you can train balance that way, most people who want to enhance their sense of balance for sport or dance or some other endeavor, want to engage balance in a dynamic way, meaning moving through lots of different planes of movement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1777" target="_blank">00:29:37.960</a></span> | <span class="t">For that, we need to consider that the vestibular system also cares about acceleration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1784" target="_blank">00:29:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So it cares about head position, it cares about eye position and where the eyes are and where you're looking, but it also cares about what direction you're moving and how fast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1794" target="_blank">00:29:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of the best things that you can do to enhance your sense of balance is to start to bring together your visual system, the semicircular canals of the inner ear, and what we call linear acceleration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1809" target="_blank">00:30:09.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So if I move forward in space rigidly upright, it's a vastly different situation than if I'm leaning to the side.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1819" target="_blank">00:30:19.960</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the best ways to cultivate a better sense of balance, literally within the sense organs and the neurons and the biology of the brain is to get into modes where we are accelerating forward, typically it's forward, while also tilted with respect to gravity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1839" target="_blank">00:30:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">With respect to gravity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1840" target="_blank">00:30:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Now this would be the carve on a skateboard or on a surfboard or a snowboard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1845" target="_blank">00:30:45.960</a></span> | <span class="t">This would be the taking a corner on a bike while being able to lean safely, of course, lean into the turn so that your head is actually tilted with respect to the earth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1857" target="_blank">00:30:57.960</a></span> | <span class="t">The head being tilted and the body being tilted while in acceleration, typically forward acceleration, but sometimes side to side has a profound and positive effect on our sense of mood and wellbeing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1869" target="_blank">00:31:09.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And as I talked about in previous episode, it can also enhance our ability to learn information in the period after generating those tilts and the acceleration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1881" target="_blank">00:31:21.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's because the cerebellum has these outputs to these areas of the brain that release these neuromodulators like serotonin and dopamine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1887" target="_blank">00:31:27.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And they make us feel really good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1890" target="_blank">00:31:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Those modes of exercise seem to have an outsized effect, both on our wellbeing and our ability to translate the vestibular balance that we achieve in those endeavors to our ability to balance while doing other things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1906" target="_blank">00:31:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So I encourage people to get into modes of acceleration while tilted every once in a while, provided you can do it safely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1913" target="_blank">00:31:53.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It's an immensely powerful way to build up your skills in the realm of balance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1918" target="_blank">00:31:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's also for most people, very, very pleasing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1922" target="_blank">00:32:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It feels really good because of the chemical relationship between forward acceleration and head tilt and body tilt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1929" target="_blank">00:32:09.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Once again, we've covered a tremendous amount of information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1932" target="_blank">00:32:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, you know how you hear, how you make sense of the sounds in your environment, how those come into your ears and how your brain processes them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1941" target="_blank">00:32:21.960</a></span> | <span class="t">In addition, we talked about things like low-level white noise and even binaural beats, which can be used to enhance certain brain states, certain rhythms within the brain, and even dopamine release in ways that allow you to learn better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1956" target="_blank">00:32:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And we talked about the balance system and this incredible relationship between your vestibular apparatus, meaning the portions of your inner ear that are responsible for balance, and your visual system and gravity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1968" target="_blank">00:32:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can use those to enhance your learning as well, as well as just to enhance your sense of balance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBgDq2ttCw&t=1974"
