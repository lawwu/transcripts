For the choir director, according to the getith, of the sons of Korah, a psalm. How lovely are your dwelling places, O Yahweh of hosts! My soul has longed and even fainted for the courts of Yahweh. My heart and my flesh sing for joy to the living God.</p><p>Even the bird has found a home in the swallow, a nest for herself, where she sets her young. At your altars, O Yahweh of hosts, my King and my God. How blessed are those who dwell in your house! They are ever praising you. How blessed is the man whose strength is in you, in whose heart are the highways to Zion.</p><p>Passing through the valley of Baca, they make it a spring. The early rain also wraps it up with blessings. They go from strength to strength. Each one of them appears before God in Zion. O Yahweh of hosts, hear my prayer. Have ear, O God of Jacob. See our shield, O God, and look upon the face of your anointed.</p><p>For better is a day in your courts than a thousand elsewhere. I would choose to stand at the threshold of the house of my God, than dwell in the tents of wickedness. For Yahweh God is a sun and shield. Yahweh gives grace and glory. No good thing does he withhold from those who walk blamelessly.</p><p>O Yahweh of hosts, how blessed is the man who trusts in you!</p></div></div></body></html>
