You can do a general discussion of repentance, but in some point of your essay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoS7quO9ImA&t=1384" target="_blank">00:23:04.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you're going to want to address the question, how would you use the doctrine of repentance in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoS7quO9ImA&t=1390" target="_blank">00:23:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">counseling others?

Wayne Grudem has given this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoS7quO9ImA&t=1422" target="_blank">00:23:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">definition for repentance.

He says that repentance is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoS7quO9ImA&t=1428" target="_blank">00:23:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">heartfelt sorrow for sin, a renouncing of it, and a sincere commitment to forsake it and walk</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoS7quO9ImA&t=1437" target="_blank">00:23:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">in obedience to Christ. So, repentance includes a heartfelt sorrow for sin,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoS7quO9ImA&t=1444" target="_blank">00:24:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">a renouncing of that sin, and then a sincere commitment to forsake it and walk in obedience</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoS7quO9ImA&t=1451" target="_blank">00:24:11.120</a></span> | <span class="t">to Christ. If you've been with us in our study, we looked at the three components of faith.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoS7quO9ImA&t=1460" target="_blank">00:24:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">There was an intellectual aspect, there was an emotional aspect, and there was a volitional</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoS7quO9ImA&t=1469" target="_blank">00:24:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">aspect of faith. Faith understands certain truths to be relevant. Faith emotionally embraces those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoS7quO9ImA&t=1480" target="_blank">00:24:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">truths in application to the person's heart, and then there's a volitional aspect of faith where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoS7quO9ImA&t=1486" target="_blank">00:24:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">faith places one's confidence or trust in a certain person or thing. And so, those categories</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoS7quO9ImA&t=1495" target="_blank">00:24:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">of intellectual, emotional, and volitional. Now, we'll find when it comes to repentance that those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoS7quO9ImA&t=1503" target="_blank">00:25:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">categories are applicable to our understanding of this doctrine as well. This isn't on your handout,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoS7quO9ImA&t=1512" target="_blank">00:25:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">but I'll put it up on the screen here. Repentance includes those three aspects. There is an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoS7quO9ImA&t=1519" target="_blank">00:25:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">intellectual understanding that sin is wrong. There is an emotional approval of the teachings</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoS7quO9ImA&t=1527" target="_blank">00:25:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">of Scripture regarding sin, and then there is a personal decision to turn from sin and seek</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoS7quO9ImA&t=1535" target="_blank">00:25:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">forgiveness from God. So, there's a similarity there to the three aspects of saving faith,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoS7quO9ImA&t=1543" target="_blank">00:25:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">intellectual, emotional, and volitional. If you look at your handout, we'll see these three</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoS7quO9ImA&t=1552" target="_blank">00:25:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">categories being addressed by different passages in Scripture. We see the emotional aspect of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoS7quO9ImA&t=1559" target="_blank">00:25:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">repentance addressed in Matthew 5, verse 4, where Jesus says, "Blessed are those who mourn,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoS7quO9ImA&t=1566" target="_blank">00:26:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">for they shall be comforted." There is a legitimate type of mourning and sorrow in the heart of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoS7quO9ImA&t=1575" target="_blank">00:26:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">a sinner who understands his or her sin before holy God.

It is the understanding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoS7quO9ImA&t=1604" target="_blank">00:26:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">that I've sinned against a holy God. It is the understanding that I violated His laws. I have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoS7quO9ImA&t=1611" target="_blank">00:26:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">dishonored Him, and there is a mourning. There is a sorrow that takes place in the sinner's heart.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoS7quO9ImA&t=1619" target="_blank">00:26:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Notice here that not all sorrow is equivalent to true repentance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoS7quO9ImA&t=1627" target="_blank">00:27:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Saul was sorry for his sin.

Or as a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoS7quO9ImA&t=1676" target="_blank">00:27:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">believer, one is sorry for, "I have sinned against my heavenly Father who so loves me and cares for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoS7quO9ImA&t=1687" target="_blank">00:28:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">me," but there is a sorrow when it comes to true repentance. And Jesus actually, far from discouraging</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoS7quO9ImA&t=1696" target="_blank">00:28:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">that type of sorrow, He pronounces a blessing upon those who mourn. "Blessed are those who mourn,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoS7quO9ImA&t=1705" target="_blank">00:28:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">for they shall be comforted." So you see there the emotional aspect of true repentance. You also see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoS7quO9ImA&t=1715" target="_blank">00:28:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">a volitional aspect to true repentance. In Luke 18 verse 13, Jesus spoke of the tax collector who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoS7quO9ImA&t=1722" target="_blank">00:28:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">was repentant, and it says that the tax collector standing far off would not even lift up his eyes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoS7quO9ImA&t=1728" target="_blank">00:28:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">to heaven, but beat his breast saying, "God be merciful to me, a sinner." So here we see both</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoS7quO9ImA&t=1737" target="_blank">00:28:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the emotional aspect of repentance and the volitional aspect of repentance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoS7quO9ImA&t=1743" target="_blank">00:29:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">He cried out for mercy.

And so a tax collector was not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoS7quO9ImA&t=1772" target="_blank">00:29:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">only viewed as a financial cheater, but also as a traitor to one's people. But here you have one who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoS7quO9ImA&t=1781" target="_blank">00:29:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">is a notorious sinner, at least in a public sense, and he's crying out for mercy.

John the Baptist preached</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoS7quO9ImA&t=2035" target="_blank">00:33:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">like a biblical counselor.

Because in verse 10, it says that the crowds asked him,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoS7quO9ImA&t=2049" target="_blank">00:34:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">"What then shall we do?"

And so the crowds asked him, "What then shall we do?" In verse 11, he answered them,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoS7quO9ImA&t=2074" target="_blank">00:34:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and he got very specific with his application.
