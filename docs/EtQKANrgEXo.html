In fact,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=69" target="_blank">00:01:09.320</a></span> | <span class="t">when I was in the third grade, I failed math in the first half of the school year. In those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">days, teacher gave grades this way, "Unsatisfactory, satisfactory, very good, and excellent," instead</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=86" target="_blank">00:01:26.120</a></span> | <span class="t">of A, B, C, D.

And like you, I found it to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.800</a></span> | <span class="t">very hard. But also, Joshua, like you, I had a mom, and she was a good mom, and she helped</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">me keep on trying until in the third grade, I was able just to pass the math course. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to try to encourage you, Joshua, not to give up, but to do the best you can,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.740</a></span> | <span class="t">no matter how hard it is. And I have four encouragements to keep you going.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=138" target="_blank">00:02:18.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Number one, God made the world to be full of math. Now, you know, Joshua, that numbers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">are like words. You may not have thought about it. The word "dog" stands for a real animal,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and we call that real animal by the word "dog." But a real dog is not a word, right? It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">a real animal. So the word "dog" is just a name. It's just a name for something that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.960</a></span> | <span class="t">real. So words help us talk to each other about what's real. Without words, all we could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.680</a></span> | <span class="t">do is point. So words are really useful, even though they're just names. They're not real</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">things, but they name real things. Now, that's the way it is with numbers, too, right? Numbers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">are like words. They stand for real things or amounts of real things. For example, if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.760</a></span> | <span class="t">you have two banana trees in your backyard, which we did when I was growing up, and on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">one banana tree, there are four bananas, and on the other banana tree, there are four bananas.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And the next day at school, somebody asks you, "Joshua, how many bananas are growing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.220</a></span> | <span class="t">on the trees in your backyard?" Well, you could say four on one tree and four on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.020</a></span> | <span class="t">other tree. Or you might say eight bananas, because four plus four is eight bananas. That's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.580</a></span> | <span class="t">math. But those numbers represent real bananas. They're not just numbers. They stand for real</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.560</a></span> | <span class="t">things that you can eat and talk about. So God made a world of bananas and dogs and thousands</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and thousands of other real things that you can count. You can put numbers and names on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.900</a></span> | <span class="t">them. That's the kind of world God made. So when we study math, we are trying to understand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the way God made the world. This is God's world, and He loves it when His people, including</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">eight-year-olds, study His world and understand it and use it for His glory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Which brings us now to the second encouragement. God made math very useful in this world. He</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.020</a></span> | <span class="t">made it to help us. Joshua, let me give you two stories, two illustrations. Suppose at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.020</a></span> | <span class="t">the gas station where your parents fill up the gas tank of the car, you notice that they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">have a special of three chocolate candy bars for one dollar. And you ask your mom, "Can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I have a dollar, please, to get those candy bars?" And she says, "Sure. And here's two</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">dollars. Get some for your friend." So you hand the man behind the cash register your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">two dollars and ask for the candy bars. And suppose he hands you five candy bars and takes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=333" target="_blank">00:05:33.880</a></span> | <span class="t">your two dollars. What are you going to say to him? If you studied math in the third grade</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">hard enough, like I tried to do, and you learned your multiplication tables, you would know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.720</a></span> | <span class="t">that if you get three candy bars for one dollar, you should get six candy bars for two dollars</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=356" target="_blank">00:05:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">because you learned in the third grade that two times three equals six, not five. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">if you didn't learn that, you'd walk out with five candy bars instead of six candy bars</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=372" target="_blank">00:06:12.520</a></span> | <span class="t">because you didn't know your math.

And you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=408" target="_blank">00:06:48.440</a></span> | <span class="t">know you can't fight off four vicious wolves and save your life. You might be able to fight</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=415" target="_blank">00:06:55.440</a></span> | <span class="t">off one wolf, but not four. So you quietly check your gun, and you notice that you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=422" target="_blank">00:07:02.440</a></span> | <span class="t">only three bullets left in your gun.

But I am so thankful to God that he gave me a mom and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=548" target="_blank">00:09:08.440</a></span> | <span class="t">a dad who knew what was best for me because I didn't know what was best for me myself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=554" target="_blank">00:09:14.440</a></span> | <span class="t">The Bible says, and you know it, "Children, obey your parents in the Lord." And I am so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=562" target="_blank">00:09:22.440</a></span> | <span class="t">glad it said that, and I'm so glad that I did it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=567" target="_blank">00:09:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Which brings me now, Joshua, to the last encouragement. God made you to show how good and how great</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=576" target="_blank">00:09:36.440</a></span> | <span class="t">he is by trusting him to help you. And God made me, too. And guess what? He changed me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=585" target="_blank">00:09:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">He changed me so that in the 10th grade, I loved geometry. That's a kind of math. Finally,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=594" target="_blank">00:09:54.440</a></span> | <span class="t">there was a kind of math I really liked. It was like a detective story. You found the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=600" target="_blank">00:10:00.440</a></span> | <span class="t">clues, and you put the clues together and discovered the solution to the problem. It</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=606" target="_blank">00:10:06.440</a></span> | <span class="t">was like finding out who the bad guy was and putting him in jail. But Joshua, to be honest,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=613" target="_blank">00:10:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">apart from geometry, I was mainly afraid of math. And when I finished my final required</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=623" target="_blank">00:10:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">basic math class in college, I felt like I had run out of a dark tunnel into broad daylight</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=631" target="_blank">00:10:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">for the rest of my life. Never, never, never have to take another course in math. Hooray!</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=637" target="_blank">00:10:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, it felt like a liberation, coming out of jail. So here's the point, Joshua.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=642" target="_blank">00:10:42.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Even though you don't like math today, you might like it someday because you grow and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=649" target="_blank">00:10:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">you change.

And that's okay. God made you the way you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=663" target="_blank">00:11:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">are. You don't have to grow up to be a mathematician. But some math is good for everybody. I promise</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQKANrgEXo&t=672" target="_blank">00:11:12.440</a></span> | <span class="t">you.
