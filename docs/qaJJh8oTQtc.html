Forget levels three and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaJJh8oTQtc&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.540</a></span> | <span class="t">above for a moment, just claiming we've reached level two is a bold enough announcement already.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaJJh8oTQtc&t=97" target="_blank">00:01:37.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Here is a 60 second extract from DevDay, and if you're wondering about the strange video setup,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaJJh8oTQtc&t=102" target="_blank">00:01:42.300</a></span> | <span class="t">it's actually a massive improvement from the super shaky footage that's circulating online. Essentially,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaJJh8oTQtc&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.580</a></span> | <span class="t">I used Adobe Warp Stabiliser, so it's a bit easier to watch. Altman here claims we are at level two.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaJJh8oTQtc&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.900</a></span> | <span class="t">How close are we to AGI?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaJJh8oTQtc&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.380</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, we used to, every time we finished the system, we would say, like, in one way, this is not an AGI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaJJh8oTQtc&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And it used to be, like, very easy. You could, like, make a little robotic hand that doesn't believe it is a game or a DotaBot, and it's like, oh, it does some things, but definitely not an AGI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaJJh8oTQtc&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.180</a></span> | <span class="t">It's obviously harder to say no. So we're trying to, like, stop talking about AGI as this general thing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaJJh8oTQtc&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.540</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, we have this levels framework, because the word AGI has become so overloaded. So, like, real quickly, we used one for chatbots, two for reasoners, three for agents, four for innovators, five for organizations, like, roughly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaJJh8oTQtc&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.220</a></span> | <span class="t">I think we clearly got to level two, or we clearly got to level two with O1, and it, you know, can do really quite impressive cognitive tasks. It's a very smart model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaJJh8oTQtc&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.220</a></span> | <span class="t">It doesn't feel AGI-like in a few important ways, but I think if you just do the one next step of making it, you know, very agent-like, which is on level three, and which I think we will be able to do in the not distant future, it will feel surprisingly capable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaJJh8oTQtc&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Being totally honest, the next two key quotes I might previously have dismissed as being pure hype, but after the O1 preview release, I'm less inclined to do so.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaJJh8oTQtc&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.980</a></span> | <span class="t">First is the commitment that the next two years are going to see very steep progress.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaJJh8oTQtc&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.860</a></span> | <span class="t">If you go from my O1 on a hard problem back to, like, Ford Turbo that we launched 11 months ago, you'll be like, wow, this is happening pretty fast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaJJh8oTQtc&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and I think the next year will be very steep progress. The next two years will be very steep progress. Harder than that. Hard to see a lot of certainty.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaJJh8oTQtc&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And next, and he didn't have to go this far, is the claim that this time next year there will be as big a gap from that model to O1 as from O1 to GPT-4 Turbo.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaJJh8oTQtc&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.980</a></span> | <span class="t">The model is going to get so much better so fast. Like, we are so early, this is like, you know, maybe it's the GPT-2 scale moment, but like, we know how to get to GPT-4. We have the fundamental stuff in place now to get to GPT-4.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaJJh8oTQtc&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And in addition to planning for us to build all of those things, plan for the model to just get, like, rapidly smarter. Like, you know, hope you all come back next year and plan for it to feel like way more of a year of improvement than from Ford Turbo.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaJJh8oTQtc&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.740</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll save the last key quote for later on in the video, but in case you're skeptical of his or even my analysis, a plethora of professors and scientists have described an incipient form of reasoning within O1.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaJJh8oTQtc&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.620</a></span> | <span class="t">One top researcher said, "In my field of quantum physics, it gives significantly more detailed and coherent responses."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaJJh8oTQtc&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Another molecular biologist said that O1 breaks the plateau that the public feared LLMs were heading into.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaJJh8oTQtc&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Then we have the creator of the graduate-level Google-proof Q&A benchmark test that's become famous.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaJJh8oTQtc&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.580</a></span> | <span class="t">It's targeted at PhD-level scholars who score an average of around 60%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaJJh8oTQtc&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.220</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the authors of that benchmark said, "It seems plausible to me that the O1 family represents a significant and fundamental improvement in the model's core reasoning capabilities."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaJJh8oTQtc&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Just yesterday, a professor of mathematics described a moving frontier between what can and cannot be done with LLMs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaJJh8oTQtc&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And that that boundary has just shifted a little.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaJJh8oTQtc&t=322" target="_blank">00:05:22.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And here was his aha moment using GPT-01 mini and 43 seconds of thought.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaJJh8oTQtc&t=329" target="_blank">00:05:29.100</a></span> | <span class="t">It came up with an entirely new, clever and correct proof that he described as being more elegant than the human proof.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaJJh8oTQtc&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.140</a></span> | <span class="t">It must be said that most of this is anecdotal, but it at least shows that the claim isn't completely outrageous from Sam Altman.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaJJh8oTQtc&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, there are plenty of benchmarks where O1 Preview is still not scoring top marks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaJJh8oTQtc&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.020</a></span> | <span class="t">To give one example, here's a new one called Psycode where O1 Preview scores just 7.7%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaJJh8oTQtc&t=355" target="_blank">00:05:55.340</a></span> | <span class="t">A noticeable step up from other models, but what is this benchmark testing?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaJJh8oTQtc&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, it includes several research problems that are built upon or reproduce methods used in Nobel Prize winning studies, including things like the Haldane model for the anomalous quantum Hall effect.</span></div><div

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaJJh8oTQtc&t=383" target="_blank">00:06:23.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's not enough just to get these sub problems right.</span></div><div

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaJJh8oTQtc&t=387" target="_blank">00:06:27.100</a></span> | <span class="t">The models have to compose solutions from those sub problems to get the 80 challenging main problems correct.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaJJh8oTQtc&t=393" target="_blank">00:06:33.340</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaJJh8oTQtc&t=399" target="_blank">00:06:39.820</a></span> | <span class="t">This is certainly not average human level problem solving.</span></div><div

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaJJh8oTQtc&t=414" target="_blank">00:06:54.380</a></span> | <span class="t">I say this as the author of Simple Bench where it is the other way round and models underperform humans, but it seems harder to create such a benchmark than the other way round.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaJJh8oTQtc&t=424" target="_blank">00:07:04.140</a></span> | <span class="t">As Sam Altman said of the Turing test, I don't want everyone just to ignore the fact that we have passed average human level reasoning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaJJh8oTQtc&t=431" target="_blank">00:07:11.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Then we could throw in the
