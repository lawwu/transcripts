Yeah. You can't even get started. So through this lens, explicit practice is a way to bootstrap yourself.</p><p>Likewise, a great way to become a better musician. All of the best pianists at sight reading that I knew in university played with churches. They were so good at sight reading because, you know, they had to show up every Sunday and they're playing a different thing, new hymn every Sunday.</p><p>So this is immersion also. And, you know, over time they're learning all these cadences and these things that are really common and whatever, but you can't show up and be the church pianist every Sunday in the first place, if you don't already have some decent foundation. So this is sort of a bootstrapping argument that one role for explicit practice of this kind is to get yourself into a position where you can more naturalistically reinforce.</p></div></div></body></html>
