Okay. And there is a hack. Again, there's a cost to it. In most airports, there's the accessibility of getting around some lines by using a paid airport employee, a greeter, to get you through security, sometimes immigration, much faster. These folks cost between $150 and $500 per use, and it does scale up based on how many people are using it at the same time.</p><p>So if you're a family of five, it might be $150 for the first passenger, then $50 for each passenger they're after. So it's not cheap. But in some places where it's confusing to get to the airport, or you've got a tight connection, if you're coming inbound from one airline and going out on another, or if you're in a foreign country and you don't speak the language, getting a greeter might be a really valuable experience.</p><p>We've used greeters at five-year-old airports across the world, right? Getting a greeter in a porter is a great way of getting through domestic airports, internationally especially, cutting lines, getting through security faster, getting through immigration faster, getting into a different lounge you might not have access to with your ticket, a great leveling up by using a greeter.</p></div></div></body></html>
