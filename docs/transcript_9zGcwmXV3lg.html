So let's just put that aside. But then if you do have the resources, are they worth it? It would really come down to, well, what is the trade-off?</p><p>Is this you have so much money under the sun, you know, that trade-off is whether you leave more inheritance, or is this you can't take vacations as a family? And I think that's gonna be so different for every family that it's really hard to give a blanket statement. I think you are probably going to get more personalized education for your children at a private school.</p><p>But I will say in some parts of the country where I grew up, there was like a gifted and talented program. In some parts of the country, there are magnet schools and charter schools that are part of the public program. And so if your child is struggling or really excelling, you might not get anything to support that as much at a public school.</p><p>There's probably more resources for people who are a little bit behind than people who are ahead, at least in our school district from what we've learned. And I think at the end of the day, there are so many options for something in the middle</p></div></div></body></html>
