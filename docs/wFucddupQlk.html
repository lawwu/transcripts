epinephrine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=81" target="_blank">00:01:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I just want to cover a little bit about what cortisol and epinephrine are,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=85" target="_blank">00:01:25.160</a></span> | <span class="t">where they are released in the body and brain, because if you can understand that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=90" target="_blank">00:01:30.340</a></span> | <span class="t">you will understand better how to control them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=93" target="_blank">00:01:33.220</a></span> | <span class="t">cortisol is a steroid hormone, much like estrogen and testosterone, in that it is derived from cholesterol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So understand that cholesterol is a precursor molecule, meaning it's the substrate from which a lot of things like testosterone and estrogen are made.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Please also understand that cholesterol can be made into estrogen or testosterone or cortisol, and that cortisol is sort of the competitive partner to estrogen and testosterone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.540</a></span> | <span class="t">What this means is no matter how much cholesterol you're eating or you produce, whether or not it's low or it's high, if you are stressed, more of that cholesterol is going to be devoted toward creating cortisol, which is indeed a stress hormone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">However, the word stress shouldn't stress you out because you need cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Cortisol is vital.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.980</a></span> | <span class="t">You don't want your cortisol levels to be too low.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.460</a></span> | <span class="t">It's very important for immune system function, for memory, for not getting depressed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You just don't want your cortisol levels to be too high and you don't want them to be elevated even to normal levels at the wrong time of day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Epinephrine or adrenaline has also been demonized a bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.240</a></span> | <span class="t">We think of it as this stress hormone, this thing that makes us anxious, fight or flight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.860</a></span> | <span class="t">The fact of the matter is that epinephrine is your best friend when it comes to your immunity, when it comes to protecting you from infection, and epinephrine, adrenaline, is your best friend when it comes to remembering things and learning and activating neuroplasticity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.020</a></span> | <span class="t">We're going to talk about that as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Once again, it's a question of how much and how long and the specific timing of release of cortisol and epinephrine as opposed to cortisol and adrenaline being good or bad.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.540</a></span> | <span class="t">They're terrific when they're regulated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">They are terrible when they're misregulated and we will give you lots of tools to regulate them better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.640</a></span> | <span class="t">cortisol biology 101 in less than two minutes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Your brain makes what we call releasing hormones.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And in this case, there's corticotropin releasing hormones, CRH, is made by neurons in your brain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.260</a></span> | <span class="t">It causes the pituitary, this gland that sits about an inch in front of the roof of your mouth and the base of your brain, to release ACTH.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">ACTH then goes and causes your adrenals, which sit above your kidneys and your lower back to release cortisol, a so-called stress hormone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But I would like you to think about cortisol, not as a stress hormone, but as a hormone of energy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It produces a situation in the brain and body whereby you want to move and whereby you don't want to rest and whereby you don't want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.620</a></span> | <span class="t">eat at least at first epinephrine or adrenaline 101 in less than two minutes, when you sense a stressor with your mind or your body senses a stressor, excuse me, from a wound or something of that sort, a signal is sent to neurons that are in the middle of your body.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.540</a></span> | <span class="t">They're called the sympathetic chain ganglia, the name doesn't necessarily matter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.980</a></span> | <span class="t">They release norepinephrine very quickly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">It's almost like a sprinkler system that just hoses your body with epinephrine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.300</a></span> | <span class="t">That will increase heart rate, will increase breathing rate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.140</a></span> | <span class="t">It will also increase the size of vessels and arteries that are giving blood flow to your vital organs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.340</a></span> | <span class="t">You also release adrenaline from your adrenals, again, riding atop your kidneys, and you release it from an area of your brain called locus ceruleus, and that creates alertness in your brain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=319" target="_blank">00:05:19.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so we have cortisol, and we have epinephrine, and their net effect is to increase energy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first tool is to make sure that your highest levels of cortisol are first thing in the morning when you wake up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.220</a></span> | <span class="t">One way or another, every 24 hours, you will get an increase in cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.580</a></span> | <span class="t">It's to stimulate movement from being asleep, presumably horizontal, to getting up and starting to move about your day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.760</a></span> | <span class="t">The best way to stimulate that increase in cortisol at the appropriate time is that very soon after waking, within 30 minutes or so after waking, get outside, view some sunlight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=357" target="_blank">00:05:57.200</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:06:01.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So you do that because in the early part of the day, you have the opportunity to time that cortisol release to the early part of the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.300</a></span> | <span class="t">It will improve your focus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=371" target="_blank">00:06:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It will improve your energy levels, and it will improve your learning throughout the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So here's how it works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=377" target="_blank">00:06:17.400</a></span> | <span class="t">On a sunny day, so no cloud cover, provided that the sun is not yet overhead, it's somewhere low in the sky.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=385" target="_blank">00:06:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It could have just crossed the horizon, or if you wake up a little bit later, it could be somewhat low in the sky.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=391" target="_blank">00:06:31.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So basically, the intensity of light, the brightness, is somewhere around 100,000 lux.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=396" target="_blank">00:06:36.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Lux is just a measurement of brightness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=398" target="_blank">00:06:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">On a cloudy day, it's about 10,000 lux.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so tenfold reduction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=404" target="_blank">00:06:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But bright artificial light, very bright artificial light, is somewhere around 1,000 lux.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And ordinary room light is somewhere around 100 to 200 lux.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=417" target="_blank">00:06:57.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So even if you have a very bright bulb sitting right next to you, that's not going to do the job.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=421" target="_blank">00:07:01.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Your phone will not do the job.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Not early in the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=424" target="_blank">00:07:04.240</a></span> | <span class="t">To get the cortisol released at the appropriate time, you need to get outside.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=428" target="_blank">00:07:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's just set a couple general parameters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=432" target="_blank">00:07:12.060</a></span> | <span class="t">If it's bright outside and no cloud cover, get outside for 10 minutes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=437" target="_blank">00:07:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">If it's a cloudy day, dense overcast, you're probably going to need about 30 minutes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=442" target="_blank">00:07:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">If it's light cloud, broken cloud cover, it's probably going to be somewhere between 10 and 20 minutes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=447" target="_blank">00:07:27.700</a></span> | <span class="t">This is why it's vital to get this light on a regular basis, to get that cortisol released early in the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=453" target="_blank">00:07:33.740</a></span> | <span class="t">That sets you up for optimal levels of energy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=456" target="_blank">00:07:36.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, throughout the day, you're going to experience different things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=459" target="_blank">00:07:39.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Most of you are not spending your entire day trying to optimize your health.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=463" target="_blank">00:07:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, some of you might be, but most of you have jobs and you have families and you have commitments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=468" target="_blank">00:07:48.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Life enters the picture and provides you stressors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=472" target="_blank">00:07:52.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Those will cause increases in cortisol and epinephrine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=476" target="_blank">00:07:56.520</a></span> | <span class="t">The key is these blips in cortisol and epinephrine need to be brief.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=481" target="_blank">00:08:01.940</a></span> | <span class="t">You can't have them so often or lasting so long that you are in a state of chronic cortisol elevation or chronic epinephrine elevation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=492" target="_blank">00:08:12.600</a></span> | <span class="t">This system of stress was designed to increase your alertness and mobilize you towards things, get you frustrated, and provide the opportunity to change behavior.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=502" target="_blank">00:08:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reason it works is that cortisol, when it's released into the bloodstream, it actually can bind to receptors in the brain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=510" target="_blank">00:08:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">It can bind receptors in the amygdala, fear centers, and threat detection centers, but also areas of the brain that are involved in learning and memory and neuroplasticity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=518" target="_blank">00:08:38.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is why I say that neuroplasticity, the brain's ability to change itself in response to experience, is first stimulated by attention and focus, and often a low-level state of agitation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=531" target="_blank">00:08:51.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So understand that, and you won't be quite so troubled about the little stress increases that you experience throughout the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=538" target="_blank">00:08:58.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, there are ways to leverage stress, epinephrine and cortisol, in ways that serve you and to do it in a deliberate way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=547" target="_blank">00:09:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">There are also ways to do that that increase your level of stress threshold, meaning they make it less likely that epinephrine and cortisol will be released.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=558" target="_blank">00:09:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So I want to talk about the science of those practices, because I get asked about these practices a lot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=562" target="_blank">00:09:22.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Things like Wim Hof breathing, which is also called Tumo breathing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=566" target="_blank">00:09:26.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Things like ice baths, things like high-intensity interval training.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=569" target="_blank">00:09:29.460</a></span> | <span class="t">All of those things have utility.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=572" target="_blank">00:09:32.980</a></span> | <span class="t">The question is how you use them and how often you use them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=577" target="_blank">00:09:37.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Those tools, just like stress from a life event, can either enhance your immunity or deplete it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=585" target="_blank">00:09:45.660</a></span> | <span class="t">That's right, those same practices of ice baths, Tumo breathing, high-intensity interval training, or training of any kind, can deplete your immune system or it can improve them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=595" target="_blank">00:09:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Excuse me, they can improve it, meaning they can improve your immune system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=599" target="_blank">00:09:59.260</a></span> | <span class="t">The key is how often you use them and when.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=603" target="_blank">00:10:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I want to review that now in light of the scientific literature, because in doing that, you can build practices into your daily or maybe every other day routine that can really help buffer you against unhealthy levels of cortisol and epinephrine, meaning cortisol increases that are much too great or that last much too long.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=622" target="_blank">00:10:22.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Epinephrine increases that are much too great or that last much too long.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=626" target="_blank">00:10:26.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's say somebody tells you something very troubling, or you look at your phone and you see a text message that's really upsetting to you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=633" target="_blank">00:10:33.480</a></span> | <span class="t">That will cause an immediate increase in epinephrine, adrenaline, in your brain and body.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=639" target="_blank">00:10:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And chances are it's going to increase your levels of cortisol as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=644" target="_blank">00:10:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's say you get into an ice bath or a cold shower.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=647" target="_blank">00:10:47.880</a></span> | <span class="t">That will cause an equivalent increase in epinephrine and cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=652" target="_blank">00:10:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's say you go out for high intensity interval training.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=655" target="_blank">00:10:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">You decide you're going to run some sprints.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=657" target="_blank">00:10:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">You can do some repeats or you're going to do some weightlifting in the gym, or you decide that you want to do some hot yoga.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=663" target="_blank">00:11:03.100</a></span> | <span class="t">You're going to increase your epinephrine and cortisol levels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=666" target="_blank">00:11:06.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And guess what?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=667" target="_blank">00:11:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">They increase your levels of energy and alertness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=669" target="_blank">00:11:09.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're somebody who struggles with energy and alertness, it can be beneficial, provided you get clearance from your doctor, to have some sort of protocol built into your day where you deliberately increase your levels of epinephrine and your levels of cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=684" target="_blank">00:11:24.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's really important to understand that the body doesn't distinguish between a troubling text message, ice, tumour breathing, or high intensity interval training, or any other kind of exercise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=696" target="_blank">00:11:36.060</a></span> | <span class="t">It's all stress.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=697" target="_blank">00:11:37.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Cognitively reframing that and telling yourself, I like this, I enjoy it, is not going to change the way that that molecule impacts your body and brain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=707" target="_blank">00:11:47.220</a></span> | <span class="t">I sort of chuckle because people would love to tell you that all you have to do is say, oh, this is good for me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=713" target="_blank">00:11:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">No, what it does to tell yourself that it's good for you or that you enjoy it is that it liberates other molecules like dopamine and serotonin that help buffer the epinephrine response.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=726" target="_blank">00:12:06.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, the way that it does that, I've talked about previous episode, but I'll just mention that dopamine is the precursor to epinephrine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=733" target="_blank">00:12:13.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Epinephrine is made from dopamine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=736" target="_blank">00:12:16.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's why if you tell yourself you're enjoying something, and because dopamine is so subjective, that you can, in some ways, as long as you're not completely lying to yourself, you can get more epinephrine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=747" target="_blank">00:12:27.820</a></span> | <span class="t">You get more mileage or more ability to push through something, and you can sort of reframe it, but it's not really cognitive reframing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=755" target="_blank">00:12:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">The cognitive part is the trigger, but it's a chemical substance that's actually occurring there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=761" target="_blank">00:12:41.220</a></span> | <span class="t">It's dopamine giving you more epinephrine, a bigger amplitude epinephrine release, and it gives you some sense of control.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=769" target="_blank">00:12:49.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So here's a protocol that anyone can use if you want to increase levels of energy, if you suffer from low energy during the daytime, or whenever it is that you'd like to be alert.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=781" target="_blank">00:13:01.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Pick a practice that you can do fairly consistently, maybe every day, but maybe every third day or every fourth day, maybe it's an ice bath or a cold bath, maybe it's a cold shower, maybe it's the cyclic inhale-exhale breathing protocol I described, if that wasn't clear, and people always ask for a demo, I'm not going to do the whole thing right now, but I'm willing to do a few rounds of this, or a few cycles, I should say.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=804" target="_blank">00:13:24.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so it's inhale, I would do that more deeply, more like, you do that 25, 30 times repeatedly, you will start to feel warm.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=815" target="_blank">00:13:35.060</a></span> | <span class="t">People in the yoga community, they say you're generating heat, you're not generating heat, releasing adrenaline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=819" target="_blank">00:13:39.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, 25 or 30 times, you will feel agitated and stressed, that's because you're releasing adrenaline in your body, and that's because you're releasing norepinephrine in your brain, and you'll be more alert.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=832" target="_blank">00:13:52.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So if all these protocols, all these activities are just equivalent, they're just stress, then how do we make them good for us?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=840" target="_blank">00:14:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">How do we actually benefit from them?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=842" target="_blank">00:14:02.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, of course, the cold itself can have some health-promoting effects, it can increase brown fat, thermogenesis, and metabolism, high-intensity interval training, or other forms of exercise, of course, has cardiovascular effects that can be good for us, as does weight training, etc.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=857" target="_blank">00:14:17.940</a></span> | <span class="t">But what we're talking about here are ways to increase energy, and to teach our brain and body, to teach ourselves how to regulate the stress response.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=868" target="_blank">00:14:28.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So in addition to the benefits of the actual practices, what we're talking about is building a system so that when you experience increases in epinephrine and cortisol from life events, you're able to better buffer those.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=882" target="_blank">00:14:42.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And we're also talking about ways that you can increase energy overall, because that's what today's episode is all about, energy and the immune system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=890" target="_blank">00:14:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a biological mechanism, there's a biological mechanism that's very important if you want to do those things, increase energy and your immune system on demand, learn to buffer stress on demand in real time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=902" target="_blank">00:15:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And it means taking these protocols, these practices, whether or not it's cold water or ice bath or exercise or any of those, and making one small but very powerful adjustment in how you perform them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=917" target="_blank">00:15:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">But in order to make that adjustment, I can't just tell you the adjustment, I have to tell you the mechanism so that you know if you're doing it correctly or not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=925" target="_blank">00:15:25.380</a></span> | <span class="t">This is really a case where if you can understand a little bit of mechanism, you will be far better off than just adopting protocols.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=934" target="_blank">00:15:34.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Cortisol, as I mentioned, is released from the adrenals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=938" target="_blank">00:15:38.620</a></span> | <span class="t">It can have action both in the body and in the brain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=941" target="_blank">00:15:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Cortisol can cross the blood brain barrier, epinephrine cannot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=945" target="_blank">00:15:45.480</a></span> | <span class="t">That's one of the reasons why it's released both from the adrenals in your body and released from this brainstem area, the locus coeruleus in your brain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=954" target="_blank">00:15:54.520</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a powerful thing because what it means is that the body can enter states of readiness and alertness while the mind remains calm.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=965" target="_blank">00:16:05.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm presuming at this point that you're getting your morning light, it's a time your cortisol increase.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=970" target="_blank">00:16:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm presuming that you want more energy or that you want to increase your immune system's function and its ability to combat infections of various kinds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=980" target="_blank">00:16:20.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, the simplest way to describe how to do that would be in the context of cold water or a breathing protocol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=987" target="_blank">00:16:27.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's presume cold water.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=989" target="_blank">00:16:29.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's say you decide you're going to take a cold shower.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=991" target="_blank">00:16:31.540</a></span> | <span class="t">You get into the cold shower and if it's cold enough, that will be stressful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=995" target="_blank">00:16:35.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You will experience an increase in epinephrine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=997" target="_blank">00:16:37.980</a></span> | <span class="t">It will increase your alertness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1000" target="_blank">00:16:40.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, you're using this as a practice, as a tool to build, you could call it resilience, but the ability to stay calm in the mind while being stressed in the body.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1009" target="_blank">00:16:49.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Epinephrine is in the body.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1011" target="_blank">00:16:51.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And you do that by subjectively trying to calm yourself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1014" target="_blank">00:16:54.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, you can do that by telling yourself it's good for you, by emphasizing your exhales, anything that you can do to try and stay calm despite the fact that you are in a heightened state of alertness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1025" target="_blank">00:17:05.420</a></span> | <span class="t">You could do this with exercise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1026" target="_blank">00:17:06.840</a></span> | <span class="t">You could do this with music.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1028" target="_blank">00:17:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Pretty much anything that will give you a really heightened state of alertness offers you the opportunity to try and stay calm in the mind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1035" target="_blank">00:17:15.380</a></span> | <span class="t">What you're trying to do at a mechanistic level is to have adrenaline released from the adrenals, but not have adrenaline epinephrine released from the brainstem to the same degree.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1047" target="_blank">00:17:27.320</a></span> | <span

<span class="t">You're not trying to say, oh, this is good for me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1050"

target="_blank">00:17:33.620</a></span> | <span class="t">You're trying to move through this calmly while maintaining alertness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1058" target="_blank">00:17:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">In the immediate period following that practice, your system, your entire brain and body are different.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1065" target="_blank">00:17:45.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Your body is actually primed to resist infection when you have high levels of epinephrine in it for short periods of time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1074" target="_blank">00:17:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So the scientific study that explored how increasing adrenaline in the body can improve immune resistance is grounded in a well-known phenomenon that increases in stress actually protect you against infection in the short term.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1091" target="_blank">00:18:11.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So I want to look at the classic data first, describe what was done, and then I want to talk about the more recent study, which is immediately actionable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1099" target="_blank">00:18:19.380</a></span> | <span class="t">There are a classic set of studies that are really based mainly on the work of somebody named Bruce McEwen, who is at the Rockefeller University in New York.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1107" target="_blank">00:18:27.340</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not going to go through all the details of the study, but essentially what they were doing was exposing subjects to some sort of infection, either bacterial or viral infection, and inducing stress.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1120" target="_blank">00:18:40.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Sounds like a double whammy, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1121" target="_blank">00:18:41.940</a></span> | <span class="t">You'd think that maybe getting a little electric shock or cold water exposure or something to increase your levels of stress and adrenaline would just make the effects of the infection worse, but no, quite the opposite.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1134" target="_blank">00:18:54.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Brief bouts of stress, which now you should be thinking about in terms of cortisol and epinephrine release, were actually able to increase immune system function.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1145" target="_blank">00:19:05.900</a></span> | <span class="t">The duration here is really important because if stress stayed too high for too long, then yes, indeed, stress can hinder the immune response.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1156" target="_blank">00:19:16.500</a></span> | <span class="t">But for a period of about one to four days, it actually can protect you by way of increasing the immune response.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1163" target="_blank">00:19:23.300</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a human study that I definitely want to point out to you because it was published more recently than the McEwen work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1170" target="_blank">00:19:30.740</a></span> | <span class="t">The title of the paper is Voluntary Activation of the Sympathetic Nervous System.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1174" target="_blank">00:19:34.440</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the system that causes fight or flight and a.k.a. stress.</span></div><div

National Academy of Sciences, 2014, and they incorporate the ever-famous Wim Hof breathing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1187" target="_blank">00:19:47.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's what they did.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1188" target="_blank">00:19:48.060</a></span> | <span class="t">They injected people with E. coli, and they had groups that either did the sorts of breathing I've been describing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1199" target="_blank">00:19:59.380</a></span> | <span class="t">that increase adrenaline release, although I should say, I don't think you need that breathing to get adrenaline release.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1205" target="_blank">00:20:05.940</a></span> | <span class="t">You could do it with cold exposure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1207" target="_blank">00:20:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">You could do it with other things, high-intensity interval training as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1210" target="_blank">00:20:10.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And what they found was that the response to the E. coli was quite different in the people that had a protocol,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1220" target="_blank">00:20:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">in this case, breathing, to increase adrenaline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1223" target="_blank">00:20:23.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is a remarkable study because what they found was that the fever, the vomiting, all the negative effects of E. coli,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1232" target="_blank">00:20:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">many of them, and in some cases all of them, were greatly attenuated by way of engaging the adrenaline system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1240" target="_blank">00:20:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">The point is you can control your immune system by finding a way that you can increase adrenaline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1247" target="_blank">00:20:47.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And this runs counter to what we always hear, which is don't get too stressed or you will get sick.</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1336" target="_blank">00:22:16.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reason is that the so-called glucocorticoids, of which cortisol is a glucocorticoid,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1342" target="_blank">00:22:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">it's caused, as we've mentioned before, by releasing hormones from the brain and ACTH from the pituitary, etc.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1350" target="_blank">00:22:30.500</a></span> | <span class="t">But normally, high levels of glucocorticoid shut off the releasing hormones in the brain and in the pituitary.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1358" target="_blank">00:22:38.260</a></span> | <span class="t">They shut down in a so-called negative feedback

that lasts more than four to seven days,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1368" target="_blank">00:22:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">causes changes in the feedback loop between the adrenals and the brain and the pituitary such that now the brain and the pituitary respond to high levels of glucocorticoids, cortisol, by releasing more of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1383" target="_blank">00:23:03.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's bad. It's a cascade of stress equals more stress equals more stress.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1390"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1393" target="_blank">00:23:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's one study that Dahlman and her colleagues did where they stimulated chronic stress by increasing corticosterone, cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1401" target="_blank">00:23:21.420</a></span> |

target="_blank">00:23:28.180</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, they would even eat lard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1409" target="_blank">00:23:29.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And that led to all sorts of things like type 2 diabetes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1412" target="_blank">00:23:32.280</a></span> | <span class="t">that led to dysfunction in the adrenal output, etc.</span></div><div class="c"><span

response.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1421" target="_blank">00:23:41.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And you should watch

target="_blank">00:23:48.780</a></span> | <span class="t">If it's a longer bout of stress, typically it triggers hunger in particular for these so-called comfort foods, sugary and fatty foods.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1436" target="_blank">00:23:56.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Other bad effects of stress is

target="_blank">00:25:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">The other compound that I think deserves attention is apigenin, A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N, apigenin,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1540" target="_blank">00:25:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">which is what's found in chamomile.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

that primarily by adjusting things like GABA and chloride channels,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1556" target="_blank">00:25:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">but also has a mild effect in reducing cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1558" target="_blank">00:25:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So ashwagandha and apigenin together sort of I would consider the most potent commercial compounds that are in supplement non-prescription form</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1569" target="_blank">00:26:09.460</a></span> | <span class="t">that one could use if they were interested in reducing chronic stress, especially late in the day by way of reducing cortisol late in the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1577" target="_blank">00:26:17.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So you're probably getting the impression that cortisol and epinephrine are a bit of a double-edged sword.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1582" target="_blank">00:26:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You want them elevated, but not for too long or too much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

practice in order to increase them in the short term.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1593" target="_blank">00:26:33.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So we should talk about protocols that can set a foundation of cortisol and epinephrine that is headed towards optimal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1604" target="_blank">00:26:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Optimization is always going to be a series of regular practices that you do every

couple hours before sleep, and they eat more or less upon waking, assuming that they're waking up more or less around the time the sun rises, maybe plus or minus two hours.</span></div><div

I'm talking about fasting as a tool to bias your system toward more epinephrine adrenaline release and toward more cortisol release, but still low enough that it's not chronic stress, that it's not causing negative health effects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1733" target="_blank">00:28:53.780</a></span> | <span class="t">One

that perhaps you do every other day, but if you can't, maybe every third day or every other day of deliberately increasing your adrenaline in your body while learning to stay calm in the mind so that you learn to separate the brain-body experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFucddupQlk&t=1756" target="_blank">00:29:16.120</a></span> | <span
