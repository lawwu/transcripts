I'm not saying you can't have money problems in level six or level five or level four, but when you're in level one, you could have other problems, but most of your problems are money problems. As you get to the higher wealth levels, all of your problems cannot be solved by money.</p><p>And that is the big realization because you can't write, you can't like, oh, I've been working so much to build this wealth to sell this business on I'm worth $15 million. But as a result of that, I can't write my spouse a check to say, hey, just, hey, just forget about all those years where I neglected you.</p><p>Like we have money now. So let's all get along. That doesn't work. You can't do that with your children. You can't write your cardiovascular system. You can't ACH your cardiovascular system just to work better, right? If you're not taking care of your health. So all the problems you're going to have in level five and level six are all the non-financial things.</p><p>That's what's being amplified. There's all the non-financial pieces of your life.</p></div></div></body></html>
