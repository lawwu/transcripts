There is so much more liquidity available through access</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=7">00:00:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">to retail and international market participants in a public setting than there is in a private</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=13">00:00:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">setting. And it is because of this liquidity premium and the easy access to putting capital in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=18">00:00:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just extraordinary how much, as I've watched close friends and companies and companies I've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=23">00:00:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">invested in, and I'm sure you guys have done the same, transition from private to public,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=28">00:00:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">the valuation jump is extraordinary on a metrics basis. So whatever the metric might be,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=34">00:00:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you get public, there is this flurry of market participation. And as a result,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=38">00:00:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">it drives up. There's a multiple expansion. Wait, wait. I thought...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=41">00:00:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Your BSPR, sorry, can I just say something? That's such an important,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=44">00:00:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">smart thing that Friedberg said. So Jason, for example, all of us,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=48">00:00:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">we're all still in the private markets. And I'm not trying to take away from the private markets,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=53">00:00:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">but what David said is so important. If you used to look at a SaaS deal,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=56">00:00:56.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you'd price that SaaS deal 10 times ARR. Then there's a little bit of inflation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=61">00:01:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the rates go up, the prices that people pay go up. Now all of a sudden we're paying 12 times,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=67">00:01:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">15 times. Now it's 20 times if you're growing 100% rate over year. So what's happened?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=71">00:01:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">The market has become more efficient and the excess return is getting eaten up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=76">00:01:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you're like, "Okay, well, that's still really good." And you wait four, five,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=80">00:01:20.560</a></span> | <span class="t">six years and you think you're going to get paid. The crazy thing is once that company transitions to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=86">00:01:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the public markets, I mean, all of a sudden, if you actually turn the investor base over and you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=91">00:01:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">actually create a float so that public market guys can buy it, they'll pay 30 times.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=96">00:01:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">That's right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=97">00:01:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">35 times, 40 times. So there's a massive multiple expansion. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=100">00:01:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">companies should be going public sooner.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=103">00:01:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">If you think about this, if I'm trying to raise money for one of my companies,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=106">00:01:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to call on my 10, 20, 30 friends that I know that are investors in private markets and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=112">00:01:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">say, "Hey guys, do you want to look at this company?"

All I need is some small number of them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=127">00:02:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">to write a couple of hundred dollar check.

The valuation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=133">00:02:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">as a result of the liquidity available in that market is so much higher because everyone's going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=137">00:02:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">to... There's going to be much more participation in bidding. And so, you know, what I think Chamath</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=141">00:02:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">has tapped into with the SPAC vehicle and what Robinhood is realizing, and I don't think that we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=148">00:02:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">all talk about this enough, but there's this massive, massive, massive market of international</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=153">00:02:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">investors, of small, of international retail investors who are now rushing into US equities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=158">00:02:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Freeberg, didn't we see that in the ICO craze as well? I think if we took anything from the ICO</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=165">00:02:45.520</a></span> | <span class="t">craze, it was the global appetite for risk and the dot-com boom before that. And I think we have to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=171">00:02:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">see that in the market.

I'm really proud of what we did. When we created this thing two years ago,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=221">00:03:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I said I want to basically create a new way of doing IPOs. I called it IPO 2.0. I reserved IPO A</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=227">00:03:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">through Z on the NYSE. I hope to fulfill that, and I think I will. But taking a step back for a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=236">00:03:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">second, in the year 2000, there were 8,000 public companies in America on the American stock</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=243">00:04:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">exchanges. And in the year 2020, there are 4,000. So we've shrunk in half the number of public</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=250">00:04:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">companies while we're still doing IPOs. And that's a huge step forward. And I think that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=250">00:04:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">a huge step forward. And I think that's a huge step forward. And I think that's a huge step forward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=250">00:04:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, at the same time, we've 10x the amount of capital and the number of people. So we don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=259">00:04:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">have a large enough surface area in the public markets. That's why companies are better off going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=264">00:04:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">public because they're going to have a much more receptive audience of people that are dying to own</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=270">00:04:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">growth of any kind. What's the earliest and the median that people should go public?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=274">00:04:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So here's the thing. So if you're one of 30 companies in a venture portfolio that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=280">00:04:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">growing at 50 plus percent, you're one of 30. But when you go public, you're one of one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=287">00:04:47.040</a></span> | <span class="t">When you're growing 50, 60%, you become very unique all of a sudden. You're a 1% kind of a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=293">00:04:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">company. You're an outlier. And so you get treated incredibly well. So that's the backdrop. I think a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=301">00:05:01.040</a></span> | <span class="t">company should be going public around year five, year six.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=304">00:05:04.240</a></span> | <span class="t">What revenue footprint?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=306">00:05:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">About 50 million. At 50 million, when they're doubling, I think that's a huge step forward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=309">00:05:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And then when they're doubling, I think that they should be going up. And it allows them to build</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=313">00:05:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">capital slowly. It allows them to basically contain control. It minimizes dilution. I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=319">00:05:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">it's a really powerful model. And then on the number of SPACs, what I would say is I think it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=324">00:05:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">really good that the market is getting diversified. I think what's going to happen is the thing with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=329">00:05:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">SPACs is it's going to be no different than in some ways the banks that preceded us,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=335">00:05:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">which is that there's going to be a distribution. You can go to Goldman Sachs, and that'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=339">00:05:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">mean one thing. You can go to Merrill Lynch or B of A or UBS or Jefferies. It'll mean other things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=345">00:05:45.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You can go to Allen and Company. It'll mean yet another different set of things. And I'm sure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=350">00:05:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">there's going to be an organization that is all about cost.

So I just think that's going to be the distribution. My personal perspective, it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=362">00:06:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">probably us and maybe one or two other people who really dominate the space.

I think it's going to be a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichI8T-QuCE&t=368">00:06:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">distribution.
