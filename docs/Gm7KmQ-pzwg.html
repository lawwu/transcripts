href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=53" target="_blank">00:00:53.820</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm originally from Clearwater, Florida.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=56" target="_blank">00:00:56.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So I moved there when I was four years old.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=59" target="_blank">00:00:59.420</a></span> | <span class="t">I moved from Michigan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=60" target="_blank">00:01:00.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So all I really remember of Michigan is being like waist high in snow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=63" target="_blank">00:01:03.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I went to school in Boston.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=67" target="_blank">00:01:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So I really love the Northeast area.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=68" target="_blank">00:01:08.980</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a place very special in my heart.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=70" target="_blank">00:01:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And I studied physics with engineering as a minor, then went to PhD work, doing a PhD in physics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=78" target="_blank">00:01:18.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And then afterwards, I worked in various facets of the public sector.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I did some consulting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=85" target="_blank">00:01:25.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I did teaching.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=87" target="_blank">00:01:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But then about 10, 15 years ago, I was asked to help write the book, God's Not Dead.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So I was actually the technical consultant behind God's Not Dead.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And I helped with that book, a lot of the technical parts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=101" target="_blank">00:01:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Is that the one that's associated with the movie?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, what happened was the book was a standalone book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=109" target="_blank">00:01:49.080</a></span> | <span class="t">It actually was inspired by the song, God's Not Dead.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=111" target="_blank">00:01:51.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And then someone said, you know, we really need to write a book on apologetics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And eventually, Bryce Brooks was asked to be the main writer for that book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So then he asked me to help with some of the technical background.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=123" target="_blank">00:02:03.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And then it was the book that actually inspired the movie.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So some movie producers read about the book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=129" target="_blank">00:02:09.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So they did the movie, which was a theatrical movie that wasn't deep into the apologetics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So it did kind of allude to some of the arguments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's sort of a tangential connection there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=138" target="_blank">00:02:18.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Got it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=139" target="_blank">00:02:19.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Got it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=139" target="_blank">00:02:19.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Got it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And you, I think I remember hearing that you did your undergrad at MIT.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Is that right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And then your-</span></div><div

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So I did my undergrad at MIT.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And for all you MIT people out there, everything is in numbers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.300</a></span> | <span class="t">I did course 8A, which was physics with engineering and computer science.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And then did my PhD at Duke University, where I finished my PhD in complex systems physics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Got it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So then about eight years ago, after I'd helped Bryce Brooks with many of his projects,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I then went to Discovery Institute's summer seminar program, which was a week-long training</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.060</a></span> | <span class="t">and the evidence to design in nature and how that leads to research.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm like, wow, I want to be on the front lines of the science.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Because for me, this whole issue of faith and science was originally important because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">of my

more about the science, I realized that it's just exciting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=192"

movement, which I remember there was sort of like a heyday where it felt like a lot of people were talking about this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2346" target="_blank">00:39:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So I remember watching some of like the Discovery Institute films, like, you know, The Privileged Planet, I think, came out of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2354" target="_blank">00:39:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think there was one called Icons of Evolution 2, I don't quite remember, but as a kid.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2358" target="_blank">00:39:18.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I remember in my high school days, like, it was a topic at, I don't know if you're familiar with JSA.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2363" target="_blank">00:39:23.480</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like a debate thing, Junior Statesman of America.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2365" target="_blank">00:39:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of the topics was should intelligent design be taught in school?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2370" target="_blank">00:39:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I feel like there was a period where it was really like getting talked about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2374" target="_blank">00:39:34.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And then it seems like there was kind of this backlash that you're describing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2377" target="_blank">00:39:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I guess I'm wondering, like, what is sort of the state of things today?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2382" target="_blank">00:39:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because I remember that like feeling of, oh, wow, Discovery Institute, they're doing good work, but they're really under fire.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2388" target="_blank">00:39:48.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was kind of wondering, like, are they going to survive this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2390" target="_blank">00:39:50.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And clearly they have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2391" target="_blank">00:39:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, you guys were around.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2392" target="_blank">00:39:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So, like, where would you say the state of things is?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2395" target="_blank">00:39:55.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Is it, like, still kind of at peak persecution or, like, how are things these days?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2400" target="_blank">00:40:00.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, what happened was there was a famous trial called the Dover Trial, which is really interesting because Discovery Institute doesn't want to teach intelligent design in high schools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2410" target="_blank">00:40:10.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Because, one, it's just politically problematic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2413" target="_blank">00:40:13.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But, two, it probably would be taught really badly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2416" target="_blank">00:40:16.180</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like people that teach religion in high schools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2417" target="_blank">00:40:17.980</a></span> | <span class="t">That's not necessarily a good thing if they don't know what they're talking about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2420" target="_blank">00:40:20.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So, our desire is simply to teach good science, like teach all of the evidence, even things like the Cameron Explosion, you know, teach the challenges.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2433" target="_blank">00:40:33.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So, teach more science, not less, about evolution.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2435" target="_blank">00:40:35.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And don't worry about teaching intelligent design.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2438" target="_blank">00:40:38.300</a></span> | <span class="t">But you still, universities shouldn't have smear campaigns against the professors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2443" target="_blank">00:40:43.720</a></span> | <span class="t">That's not a good thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2444" target="_blank">00:40:44.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But then this Dover Trial took place, and Discovery Institute had said to these people,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2450" target="_blank">00:40:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Please don't make a law to force people to teach intelligent design, or even to allow it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2454" target="_blank">00:40:54.740</a></span> | <span class="t">This is going to be a problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2455" target="_blank">00:40:55.540</a></span> | <span class="t">We weren't listened to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2457" target="_blank">00:40:57.380</a></span> | <span class="t">They had this court case.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2458" target="_blank">00:40:58.460</a></span> | <span class="t">They invited Mike Behe to come in to do testimony.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2462" target="_blank">00:41:02.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And what happened is the judge basically watched this movie called Inherit the Wind and just basically gave verbatim propaganda written by atheists against us and said, well, I don't think intelligent design is science.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2477" target="_blank">00:41:17.220</a></span> | <span class="t">It shouldn't be taught.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2478" target="_blank">00:41:18.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And then that was the excuse people made used to say, well, you see, it's been disproven.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2483" target="_blank">00:41:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It's been discredited.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2485" target="_blank">00:41:25.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, to say that a judge discredited an entire scientific movement is ridiculous.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2490" target="_blank">00:41:30.380</a></span> | <span class="t">But people were just looking for any excuse they could find to shut this down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2495" target="_blank">00:41:35.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there was increased persecution against people that supported it, people that if there was a grad student that showed sympathies or said, you need to stop talking about this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2503" target="_blank">00:41:43.380</a></span> | <span class="t">You're not going to you're not going to afford the career.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2506" target="_blank">00:41:46.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And people started like the Rick Sternbergs, just their lives are destroyed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2510" target="_blank">00:41:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's a lot like the church in China.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2512" target="_blank">00:41:52.360</a></span> | <span class="t">In China, when Mao came along, it became very dangerous to be a Christian.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2517" target="_blank">00:41:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So the Chinese went under the Chinese Christians went underground and people in the West thought they had vanished.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2524" target="_blank">00:42:04.120</a></span> | <span class="t">But what happened is the church was growing and growing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2527" target="_blank">00:42:07.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And then once China was more open and there was better communication, people were like, whoa, there's there's like hundreds of millions of Christians.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2535" target="_blank">00:42:15.880</a></span> | <span class="t">What happened?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2536" target="_blank">00:42:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">What's happened is we've gone largely underground.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2538" target="_blank">00:42:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So our network of scientists are very quiet about their views.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2541" target="_blank">00:42:21.860</a></span> | <span class="t">We work behind the scenes.</span></div><div

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2549" target="_blank">00:42:29.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Like I'm perfectly comfortable being like the clown at the dunking booth at the fair.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2553" target="_blank">00:42:33.620</a></span> | <span class="t">People want to throw rocks at me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2555" target="_blank">00:42:35.540</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't care.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2556" target="_blank">00:42:36.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm just I'm real thick, thick.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2557" target="_blank">00:42:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's very few of us that have put ourselves in that position.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2561" target="_blank">00:42:41.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Then we just support the people doing the research behind the scenes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2564" target="_blank">00:42:44.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So in terms of the public perspective, the persecution, if anything, has increased.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2569" target="_blank">00:42:49.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So and also it's been very effective because a lot of people have invested a lot of money influencing Christian leaders.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2577" target="_blank">00:42:57.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So you'll have people with very, very deep financial pockets that will hold conferences where the only people invited are Christians that embrace evolution.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2587" target="_blank">00:43:07.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Then those Christians will gain enormous rewards.</span></div><div

design, if you say Christian should just uncritically embrace the materialist framework, the world will be at your footstep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2601" target="_blank">00:43:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, you will be blessed beyond imagination.</span></div><div class="c"><span

government.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2605" target="_blank">00:43:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">You name it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2607" target="_blank">00:43:27.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So the cost of questioning the status quo is enormous.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2612" target="_blank">00:43:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And the rewards for promoting the status quo in the church are enormous.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2617" target="_blank">00:43:37.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So what's happened is there's been very coordinated smear campaigns in churches against Discovery Institute.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2622" target="_blank">00:43:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">There's been enormous pressure on Christians just to embrace the evolutionary framework.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2628" target="_blank">00:43:48.020</a></span> | <span class="t">They're told if you don't embrace evolution, you threaten the existence of the church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2632"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2638" target="_blank">00:43:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So theologians were basically said, you've got to make scripture, theology, church history compatible with evolution.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2645" target="_blank">00:44:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's essentially a rewriting of church history.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2648" target="_blank">00:44:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a reinterpretation of scripture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2651" target="_blank">00:44:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There was a reinterpretation of church leaders like Aquinas to conform to the evolutionary framework.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2661" target="_blank">00:44:21.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's been the challenge we face.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2663" target="_blank">00:44:23.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, most of the opposition against us is from misinformation.</span></div><div

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=2679" target="_blank">00:44:39.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And what will happen is you'll have people that will review the book, but they'll

looks less often, less like the edicts of an omnipotent creator than the incoherent babblings of a severely intoxicated alcoholic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=3021" target="_blank">00:50:21.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So what's happened is Christians, that's like the movie Inception.</span></div><div

<span class="t">Well, when you tell a Christian that the science suggests that they are at least to a large extent unintended accidents, that's an idea that will spread like a virus.</span></div><div

faith.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=3042" target="_blank">00:50:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And others of them may not lose their faith, but the tension will cause them to live a schizophrenic faith where they'll compartmentalize their faith.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

very sincerely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=3073" target="_blank">00:51:13.300</a></span> | <span class="t">They love

happens is the theistic evolutionists say, this is the only opinion you're allowed to have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=3092" target="_blank">00:51:32.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And they use tactics of emotional manipulation, intellectual bullying.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=3097" target="_blank">00:51:37.220</a></span> | <span class="t">They say you're against science if you don't believe this.</span></div><div

down to the altar of Darwin to confess the secular scientific establishment of Lord of their lives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=3109" target="_blank">00:51:49.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And they can still have Jesus as part of their life as long as it's

extreme, but at times that's what Christians are pressured to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=3117"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=3606" target="_blank">01:00:06.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And he wrote a book, a poem called Temple of Nature, where he was bringing back this materialist</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=3612" target="_blank">01:00:12.500</a></span> | <span class="t">view of

free thinkers who were very much shaped by materialist philosophers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=3621" target="_blank">01:00:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So Darwin's philosophical lens was very materialistic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=3624" target="_blank">01:00:24.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And he portrayed himself in his biography, his autobiography, as very open to evidence, just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=3630" target="_blank">01:00:30.680</a></span> | <span class="t">seeking the

portrayed himself in his private letters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=3634" target="_blank">01:00:34.580</a></span> | <span class="t">But he wanted to, because it's a very Christian culture, he had to give God language to his ideas.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=3640" target="_blank">01:00:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But what was interesting is he took Paley's arguments, his examples, and even the cadence, and Stephen J.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=3649" target="_blank">01:00:49.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Gold talks about this, but changed, replaced God with natural selection.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=3655" target="_blank">01:00:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So natural selection became like a demigod with limitless creative power that allowed you to remove God from creation and follow in the tradition of the materialists back to Democritus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=3665" target="_blank">01:01:05.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So what happened at the same time in society is you've got skeptical philosophers, people like Voltaire, people like Hume, people like Spinoza, who were rethinking society from the perspective that either God doesn't exist or he's not involved.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=3680" target="_blank">01:01:20.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And what happened, it was those philosophical tailwinds of the skeptical materialist philosophy that helped to propel the evolutionary narrative to the forefront.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=3690" target="_blank">01:01:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was the evolutionary narrative that helped to empower and legitimate these secular philosophies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=3697" target="_blank">01:01:37.060</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, you have people like Aldous Huxley, who was the grandchild of Thomas Huxley, who was one of the most vocal defenders of Darwin, who basically said that a lot of the philosophers liked the idea that we weren't created by God because then we wouldn't have a purpose, and we could choose our own purpose.</span></div><div

live.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=3718" target="_blank">01:01:58.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So you see that there's these very deep philosophical motivations that help to propel the theory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=3723" target="_blank">01:02:03.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, the theory people embraced on its own merits.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=3726" target="_blank">01:02:06.760</a></span> | <span class="t">It was a very powerful theory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=3728" target="_blank">01:02:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">It was very unifying.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=3729" target="_blank">01:02:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So there are certainly very rational reasons to accept it.</span></div><div

<span class="t">But you have, like, the third wave of evolutionists, people like Jim Shapiro, people like Gerd Mueller, people like Dennis Noble, very thoughtful.</span></div><div class="c"><span

got to come up with something, or else if we don't, we've got to embrace this idea of design, and we don't want to do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=3921" target="_blank">01:05:21.060</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, there was another famous philosopher I quoted from during my presentation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=3925" target="_blank">01:05:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It was Richard Levant,

class="t">He basically said that what you have to understand about the debate between science and the supernatural is scientists will accept a natural explanation no matter how implausible, no matter how counterintuitive, because we're not willing to allow a divine foot in the door.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=3947" target="_blank">01:05:47.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So evolution really is the only idea that people have of how you can create these brilliant engineering designs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=3953" target="_blank">01:05:53.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And they're looking beyond natural selection.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=3956" target="_blank">01:05:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">They're looking to things like niche construction, things like phenotypic plasticity, lots of other, you know, lots of additions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=3964" target="_blank">01:06:04.640</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's really nothing on the table that can help, because if you look at the mathematical timescales, you look at lack of mutations that create logical changes, you look at the fossil record,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=3976" target="_blank">01:06:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">everything points to the idea of one of two possibilities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=3978" target="_blank">01:06:18.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Either God directly created things from scratch, or he took something that existed and radically altered it in a very short period of time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=3987" target="_blank">01:06:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And I mention that because there is some evidence for common ancestry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=3991" target="_blank">01:06:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">People will talk about things like the Gulo pseudogene.</span></div><div

reasonably be interpreted as common ancestry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=3999" target="_blank">01:06:39.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm not critical of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=4001" target="_blank">01:06:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">But all the evidence suggests that it's impossible for an undirected process to create these large scale changes in the time available.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=4010" target="_blank">01:06:50.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And all of the evidence shows that a mind designed things in advance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=4015" target="_blank">01:06:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">That's where we're in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=4016" target="_blank">01:06:56.680</a></span> | <span class="t">That's very helpful, because I think what people often hearing all this will say is stuff like, well, eventually we'll find a theory, or eventually something will come up, and it'll explain all this data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=4029" target="_blank">01:07:09.260</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, we just haven't found it yet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=4030" target="_blank">01:07:10.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But what you're saying is, no, no, the data is pointing in a direction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=4034" target="_blank">01:07:14.100</a></span> | <span class="t">But then because of, because, oh, Isaiah, I think your theory is going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=4040" target="_blank">01:07:20.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, my theory did something funny.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=4043"

target="_blank">01:07:24.280</a></span> | <span class="t">But so because, so all the evidence is pointing in one direction, but because of this materialistic, and I like the way you put it, the tailwinds, you know, there was this historical moment where suddenly like the perfect storm of like all these different things happened.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=4058" target="_blank">01:07:38.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And then like, it really turned the tide on the society and culture and the whole thought around that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=4065" target="_blank">01:07:45.180</a></span> | <span class="t">That's why, like, people are holding on to this, this theory that no longer works, you know?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=4072" target="_blank">01:07:52.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, gosh, have you ever seen, what does it take, I guess, for a scientist who like was totally willing to concede God, but then somehow, even with that is like materialism,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=4088" target="_blank">01:08:08.240</a></span> | <span

that's a big challenge, but it's also a spiritual battle because again, in like Paul talks about, I think it was a second Corinthians chapter 10, one through four talks about how we don't wage war

that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=4949" target="_blank">01:22:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, I didn't know he covered

there's, like, one-page or two-page articles you could read to get introduced to it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=4962"

academics, but they value giving your life fully to God, that care about students.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=5003"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm7KmQ-pzwg&t=5018" target="_blank">01:23:38.500</a></span> | <span class="t">But in all things, give your heart fully to God.</span></div><div class="c"><span
