So in this chapter we are just going to introduce</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi7nqB37WEY&t=30" target="_blank">00:00:30.220</a></span> | <span class="t">agents within the context of linechain. We're going to keep it relatively simple. We're going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi7nqB37WEY&t=36" target="_blank">00:00:36.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to go into much more depth in agents in the next chapter where we'll do a bit of a deep dive but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi7nqB37WEY&t=44" target="_blank">00:00:44.040</a></span> | <span class="t">we'll focus on just introducing the core concepts and of course agents within linechain here. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi7nqB37WEY&t=52" target="_blank">00:00:52.120</a></span> | <span class="t">jumping straight into our notebook, let's run our prerequisites. You'll see that we do have an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi7nqB37WEY&t=59" target="_blank">00:00:59.880</a></span> | <span class="t">additional prerequisite here which is Google search results. That's because we're going to be using the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi7nqB37WEY&t=64" target="_blank">00:01:04.600</a></span> | <span class="t">SERP API to allow our LLM as an agent to search the web which is one of the great things about agents</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi7nqB37WEY&t=73" target="_blank">00:01:13.980</a></span> | <span class="t">that they can do all of these additional things and LLM by itself obviously cannot. So we'll come down to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi7nqB37WEY&t=80" target="_blank">00:01:20.300</a></span> | <span class="t">here we have our Linesmith parameters again of course so you enter your linechain API key if you have one and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi7nqB37WEY&t=87" target="_blank">00:01:27.260</a></span> | <span class="t">now we're going to take a look at tools which is a very essential part of agents. So tools are a way for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi7nqB37WEY&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.980</a></span> | <span class="t">us to augment our LLMs with essentially anything that we can write in code. So we mentioned that we're going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi7nqB37WEY&t=104" target="_blank">00:01:44.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Google search tool, that Google search tool is some code that gets executed by our LLM in order to search</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi7nqB37WEY&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Google and get some results. So a tool can be thought of as any code logic or any function indicate in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi7nqB37WEY&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.900</a></span> | <span class="t">case of Python and a function that has been formatted in a way so that our LLM can understand how to use it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi7nqB37WEY&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.060</a></span> | <span class="t">and then actually use it although the LLM itself is not using the tool it's more our agent execution logic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi7nqB37WEY&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.020</a></span> | <span class="t">which uses the tool for the LLM. So we're going to go ahead and actually create a few simple tools we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi7nqB37WEY&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.060</a></span> | <span class="t">going to be using what is called the tool decorator from Langchain and there are a few things to keep in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi7nqB37WEY&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.020</a></span> | <span class="t">when we're building tools. So for optimal performance our tool needs to be just very readable and what I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi7nqB37WEY&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.500</a></span> | <span class="t">mean by readable is we need three main things. One is a dot string that is written in natural language and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi7nqB37WEY&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.700</a></span> | <span class="t">it is going to be used to explain to the LLM when and why and how it should use this tool. We should also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi7nqB37WEY&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.860</a></span> | <span class="t">have clear parameter names. Those parameter names should tell the LLM okay what each one of these parameters</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi7nqB37WEY&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.940</a></span> | <span class="t">are they should be self-explanatory. If they are not self-explanatory we should be including an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi7nqB37WEY&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.140</a></span> | <span class="t">explanation for those parameters within the dot string. Then finally we should have type annotations</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi7nqB37WEY&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.900</a></span> | <span class="t">for both our parameters and also what we're returning from the tool. So let's jump in and see how we would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi7nqB37WEY&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.100</a></span> | <span class="t">implement all of that. So come down to here and we have linechain core tools import tools okay so these are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi7nqB37WEY&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.540</a></span> | <span class="t">just four incredibly simple tools. We have the addition or add tool, multiply, the exponentiate and the subtract tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi7nqB37WEY&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay so a few calculator s tools. Now when we add this tool decorator it is turning each of these tools</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi7nqB37WEY&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.820</a></span> | <span class="t">into what we call a structured tool object. So you can see that here we can see we have this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi7nqB37WEY&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.900</a></span> | <span class="t">structured tool we have a name description okay and then we have this arg schema we'll see this in a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi7nqB37WEY&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.980</a></span> | <span class="t">moment and a function right so this function is literally just the original function it's a mapping</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi7nqB37WEY&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.060</a></span> | <span class="t">to the original function so in this case it's the add function. Now the description we can see is coming</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi7nqB37WEY&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.140</a></span> | <span class="t">from our dot string and of course the name as well is just coming from the function name.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi7nqB37WEY&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.900</a></span> | <span class="t">okay and then we can also see let's just print the name and description but then we can also see the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi7nqB37WEY&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.860</a></span> | <span class="t">args schema right we can so this thing here that we can't read at the moment to read it we're just going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi7nqB37WEY&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.820</a></span> | <span class="t">to look at the model.json schema method and then we can see what that contains which is all of this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi7nqB37WEY&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.380</a></span> | <span class="t">information. So this actually contains everything includes properties so we have the x it creates a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi7nqB37WEY&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.700</a></span> | <span class="t">title for that and it also specifies the type okay so the type that we define is float float for openai</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi7nqB37WEY&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.340</a></span> | <span class="t">gets mapped to number rather than just being float and then we also see that we have this required</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi7nqB37WEY&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.420</a></span> | <span class="t">field so this is telling our lm which parameters are required which ones are optional so we you know in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi7nqB37WEY&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.460</a></span> | <span class="t">some cases you would we can even do that here let's do z that is going to be float or none okay and we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi7nqB37WEY&t=319" target="_blank">00:05:19.500</a></span> | <span class="t">just going to say it is 0.3 all right wait i'm going to remove this in a minute because it's kind of weird but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi7nqB37WEY&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.700</a></span> | <span class="t">let's just see what that looks like so you see that we now have x y and z but then in z we have some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi7nqB37WEY&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.380</a></span> | <span class="t">additional information okay so it can be any of it can be a number or it can just be nothing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi7nqB37WEY&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.820</a></span> | <span class="t">the default value for that is 0.3 okay and then if we look here we can see that the required</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi7nqB37WEY&t=348" target="_blank">00:05:48.780</a></span> | <span class="t">field does not include z so it's just x and y so it's describing the full function schema for us but let's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi7nqB37WEY&t=356" target="_blank">00:05:56.940</a></span> | <span class="t">remove that okay and we can see that again with our exponentiate tool</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi7nqB37WEY&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.380</a></span> | <span class="t">similar thing okay so how how are we going to invoke our tool so the lm the underlying lm is actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi7nqB37WEY&t=373" target="_blank">00:06:13.180</a></span> | <span class="t">going to generate a string okay so we'll look something like this this is going to be our lm output so it is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi7nqB37WEY&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.340</a></span> | <span class="t">is a string that is some json and of course to load a string into a dictionary format we just use json</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi7nqB37WEY&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.860</a></span> | <span class="t">loads okay so let's see that so this could be the output from our lm we load it into a dictionary and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi7nqB37WEY&t=398" target="_blank">00:06:38.220</a></span> | <span class="t">then we get an actual dictionary and then what we would do is we can take our exponentiate tool we access the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi7nqB37WEY&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.540</a></span> | <span class="t">underlying function and then we pass it the keyword arguments from our dictionary here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi7nqB37WEY&t=412" target="_blank">00:06:52.780</a></span> | <span class="t">okay and that will execute our tool that is the tool execution logic that line chain implements and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi7nqB37WEY&t=421" target="_blank">00:07:01.500</a></span> | <span class="t">then later on in the next chapter we'll be implementing ourselves cool so let's move on to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi7nqB37WEY&t=427" target="_blank">00:07:07.580</a></span> | <span class="t">creating an agent

so you see if we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi7nqB37WEY&t=815" target="_blank">00:13:35.740</a></span> | <span class="t">scroll up a little bit

that very quickly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi7nqB37WEY&t=867" target="_blank">00:14:27.580</a></span> | <span class="t">before we jump in

the observation from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi7nqB37WEY&t=902" target="_blank">00:15:02.940</a></span> | <span class="t">from the tool so

target="_blank">00:16:54.220</a></span> | <span class="t">get the response okay which is pretty cool and then the final result there is negative 11.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
