And the book of the day is How to Make People Like You by Nicholas Boothman. How to Make People Like You by Nicholas Boothman. Just finished this book last week and really enjoyed it. I give it a four star, really well written book, really useful content. I think this is a fundamental life skill and this is well worth reading. If you've never read a book on how to build rapport, how to connect with people, this would be a good one to start with. And I think that all young people should be forced to read books like this. In the same, you know, a lot of these books, they build on a lot of the research that's gone on for a long time. A more foundational book would be How to Win Friends and Influence People. But what I loved about this book is it's much more tactical than How to Win Friends and Influence People. How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie was very over-arching and useful. But this book gives some very specific, very useful tactics. It gives a game plan. So if you're training somebody on how to do something, then they need to know some specific tactics. And this book gives those tactics. It specifically gives you a series of steps for you to follow when first meeting somebody so that they like you in 90 seconds or less. Now, self-help book titles often tend to sound a little bit shmarmy. They sound a little bit over the top. How to Make People Like You in 90 Seconds or Less sounds a little bit-- sounds like kind of a big promise. I think the book does a good job, though, of actually delivering on that. And those types of titles make a book stand out on the bookshelf to make you pick it up. But there's nothing unethical about these tools and techniques. They're as simple as adopting a useful attitude towards somebody, making sure that you send them the type of positive energy that you want them to have, mirroring them and establishing rapport, and asking them open-ended questions to get to know who they are. Those are tactics and techniques that all of us should be employing on a daily basis. So a really useful introduction to the subject. I listen to the audiobook version. I'm buying the paperback version because this is one of those books that I want to have on my shelf as a reference book. And once a year or so, I'll pick it up, flip through it, spend a week or two intentionally practicing every time I meet somebody just to make sure that I'm constantly improving and maintaining my skills in that department. I don't know that I'll listen to the audiobook version again, although I haven't bought it yet. I got the audiobook on this one from my library. I actually probably would, maybe once a year or so, listen back to the audiobook version again. And then definitely I want to have the paperback, though, so I can just flip through the outline really quick. So that's the book, four stars, really enjoyed it. If you've never read a book on the subject, definitely get this one. Even if you have read a book on the subject, if it's been a while since you've talked about rapport and charisma, developing that ability to make people like you, this would be a good one for a review. So that's the book. It looks like this, How to Make People Like You in 90 Seconds or Less by Nicholas Boothman. Check it out.
