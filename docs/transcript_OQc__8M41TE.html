And then maybe at some point, that Ponzi scheme started to run short on cash. So he decided to start an exchange, and the exchange got more cash, and then he used the cash to pay off whatever.</p><p>I think that's one version. And then the maximally exculpatory version, which actually is still really bad, is Alameda was a real company. They really made money trading. They took tons of risks, and SPF has talked about why he thinks that's a good thing, that FTX cut some corners when they were raising money, and that they had really bad internal accounting, and that basically the extended entity of Alameda and FTX sort of lost track of whose money was where, and it ended it up with Alameda Spending.</p></div></div></body></html>
