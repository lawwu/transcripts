You're not talking about clients, obviously.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. I focused on advisor incentives, but also the incentives of people working in corporations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I'm sure that my business school cost accounting and financial accounting professors would be very surprised that I really took to this because those weren't subjects that I shined in in business school.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But all of a sudden, the economics, the behavioral decision making, the accounting all came together, and I really felt like I was in the right place to be able to protect people and to try to create better systems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I have to say, I believe after all these years of working in securities fraud, that most people can be drawn into doing something bad if the right circumstances are there. And I hate to say that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, Lisa, that's interesting you say that because when I was working in the brokerage industry, there was a compensation method that as soon as you went in, you had to pass your exams and so forth before you could sell anything, before you could be an advisor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the firm that I went to, which was Kidder Peabody, initially back in the late 1980s, paid me a salary for one year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But then in the second year, every month I got less and less money. My salary went to zero. And by the end of the second year, I had to be making it 100% on commissions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=319" target="_blank">00:05:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I ended up able to do that, but I watched a few of my colleagues do some unethical and in some cases illegal things just to be able to bring some money home to their family and to make it in the industry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=334" target="_blank">00:05:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They didn't start out that way. It's not what they intended to do. However, they did eventually get caught up in some illegal activity. One person actually created his own mutual fund and had the client's fund, his mutual fund, which just went into his bank account.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=348" target="_blank">00:05:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then when he had $2 million in there, he left for Singapore before they caught him. Another broker was selling some Canadian penny stock and doing a pump and dump scheme. I mean, all these things were going on with these new brokers because they needed to feed their families after the first year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And they were getting desperate. And desperation, I noticed, I witnessed it, I watched it, causes people to do some things that I don't think they would ordinarily do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=375" target="_blank">00:06:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I agree. I have seen that so many times. I saw so many different types of ways that people went astray. And the thing that can pull you back is fear of being caught.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=393" target="_blank">00:06:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So having really good compliance and supervisory provisions in place helps, but also the ethics of the environment that you're in. And even though I felt like business school was an epiphany for me, I was disappointed to see the lack of ethics teaching and the lack of emphasis on ethics when I was in business school.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=416" target="_blank">00:06:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm glad that things have changed. And that is much more of a part of the curriculum now to me. And ultimately, that's what led me to shift from business school to law school, was I just felt like the rules are important and we shouldn't just be trying to get around the rules or get as close to the edge as possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=436" target="_blank">00:07:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">How do we create a system for enforcing the rules? But I wanted to go beyond that and create incentives for people to comply with the rules.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=448" target="_blank">00:07:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When we're talking about the people, the advisors, we're really broken down into two different types, right? There are the broker-dealers and then the investment advisors. How does the SEC sort of differentiate between these two?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=461" target="_blank">00:07:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, broker-dealers, or we generally refer to them as brokers, are historically just salesmen. That was in the old days. You just called your broker or your broker called you and it was just like a car salesman.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=478" target="_blank">00:07:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the broker just had to have a reasonable basis for believing that a recommended stock or strategy or mutual fund was appropriate or suitable for a customer. Whereas an investment advisor is somebody who's a fiduciary.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=496" target="_blank">00:08:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's somebody who provides advice and it has to be in the best interest of the customer. The investment advisor puts the interests of the customer ahead of his own.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But do they? I mean, sir, you have examined a lot of investment advisors who are fiduciaries. And I was an investment advisor. I was a broker for 10 years and then I was an investment advisor for 17 years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=523" target="_blank">00:08:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And yes, there was situations like I described where the brokers didn't put their clients' best interests first. But I've seen a lot of situations where the only investment advisors who were fiduciaries also didn't put their own clients' best interests first.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=537" target="_blank">00:08:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, as far as what to do with money. Should you pay off your house? Should you roll this 401(k) back into another 401(k) or put it in an IRA? You know, the AUM or assets under management incentive for the investment advisor who wants to get more and more and more AUM under management.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=556" target="_blank">00:09:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I've seen some advisors give some pretty bad advice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=560" target="_blank">00:09:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, I absolutely agree. This is the legal structure that exists, but that doesn't mean that everybody complies with the law and rules that they are required to comply with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=574" target="_blank">00:09:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's why the examination process that the SEC has for investment advisors is so important. And it's good that the SEC is getting more resources to be able to do more regular exams of investment advisors so that those investment advisors know that the SEC is going to show up regularly and will be, I hope, more likely to comply with the rules.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=603" target="_blank">00:10:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Could you explain, if you will, what responsibility FINRA has and who is FINRA and what responsibility do they have to protect investors, which is different from the Security Exchange Commission? So how do those two work together?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=619" target="_blank">00:10:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">FINRA is a self-regulatory organization. And that's sort of a weird hybrid. It's of government and private.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=631" target="_blank">00:10:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">FINRA operates under the supervision of the Securities and Exchange Commission, but it is a private organization that is run by the industry, by brokerage firms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=646" target="_blank">00:10:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's kind of, you know, to my mind, the fox guarding the henhouse. FINRA has two main parts to its process. One is its enforcement and regulatory arm, where it creates the rules for the brokerage industry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=665" target="_blank">00:11:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it has to get the SEC's approval for those rules, but it creates the rules. And on the other side, it runs an arbitration forum for disputes between brokerage participants, brokerage industry participants, but also for customers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=683" target="_blank">00:11:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Almost every customer has to go through that process if that person has a dispute with a brokerage firm. Yeah, so that's very different from the government agency, the Securities and Exchange Commission, that has primary responsibility for regulating and supervising investment advisors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=706" target="_blank">00:11:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So FINRA, if you're a broker, FINRA is going to come and do compliance examinations of your business, and FINRA enforcement is possibly going to call you to investigate you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=722" target="_blank">00:12:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Whereas if you're an investment advisor and not also a broker, you're not going to hear from FINRA. You will hear from the SEC or other securities industry regulators.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=735" target="_blank">00:12:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The SEC obviously has authority to bring action against investment advisors, but does FINRA, outside of arbitration, have any authority?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=747" target="_blank">00:12:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">FINRA does have authority to bring regulatory actions. The first thing that FINRA does is files a charge against, let's say, a financial advisor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=759" target="_blank">00:12:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's a hearing process that takes place where the FINRA enforcement attorneys present evidence, and that financial advisor presents contrary evidence, and a hearing officer makes a determination.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=775" target="_blank">00:12:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That then can be appealed to one level at FINRA and then on to the Securities and Exchange Commission and into the courts then.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=785" target="_blank">00:13:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it is a robust process, and FINRA enforcement does conduct a significant number of investigations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=795" target="_blank">00:13:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I will say personally that in my dealings on the customer side with FINRA enforcement, I think too often they accept sort of facile, simplistic explanations from the brokerage industry about why something happened.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=811" target="_blank">00:13:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I don't trust them nearly as much as I do other securities regulators. That's not a surprise. They're run by the brokerage industry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=821" target="_blank">00:13:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And just to clarify, you're no longer working for the SEC. You have your own private practice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=826" target="_blank">00:13:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's right. I have my own firm. I have not been at the SEC for many years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=830" target="_blank">00:13:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So if somebody had a complaint either against a broker who works for Wells Fargo or Merrill Lynch or whomever brokerage firm, we used to call them wire houses. I don't know if that term is still being used anymore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=845" target="_blank">00:14:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Or somebody had a complaint against an investment advisor who is registered either with the state that they're in, depending on how much money they have under management, or the Securities and Exchange Commission.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=858" target="_blank">00:14:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Do they have to go to different entities to file a complaint, or is it all done in the same place?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=864" target="_blank">00:14:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You have pointed out exactly the major complaint that I have with this industry, with regulation in this industry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=875" target="_blank">00:14:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's too confusing. You do have to go to different places. And it's ridiculous that a customer should have to figure out when they're dealing with an investment professional, am I supposed to call an insurance regulator because I might have invested in indexed annuities?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=897" target="_blank">00:14:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Or am I supposed to call the SEC because it's an investment advisor? Or am I supposed to call FINRA because this is a broker? And what about if it's somebody who's dual licensed, which a lot of financial advisors, a lot of investment advice providers are dual registrants.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=917" target="_blank">00:15:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it makes a big difference because the robustness of an investigation that you are going to get, if you call FINRA versus calling the SEC versus calling a state regulator, it makes a difference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=932" target="_blank">00:15:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, in many ways, I think customers have to consult with a lawyer before they even know where to go. And that doesn't make sense. This is just a goofy system. It's way too complicated, but not surprisingly, that works to the advantage of the industry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=951" target="_blank">00:15:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">People don't make complaints or they make complaints in the wrong way. And, you know, they may end up hurting their own case if they end up ultimately bringing an arbitration to be able to recover their losses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=965" target="_blank">00:16:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Then another thing to know is that when you bring a complaint to a regulator, that regulator doesn't represent you. FINRA doesn't represent you, you know, when they're bringing actions. The SEC does not represent you, the customer. State regulators do not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=982" target="_blank">00:16:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Their interest is in the system, in preserving the integrity of the industry. And while they do want to make sure that customers are protected, you know, if you want to make sure that you are recovering your losses, you really do have to have your own lawyer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=1001" target="_blank">00:16:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes the SEC does get money back to customers, and sometimes FINRA does, and sometimes state regulators do, but not always, and not even most of the time. So it's important to know that before you go to a regulator.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=1019" target="_blank">00:16:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So unless you know what the jurisdiction is or who is responsible and you know how to fill out the paperwork and you know how to go, where to go to file a complaint against an advisor or insurance agent or whomever you feel that you've gotten some bad advice from.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=1036" target="_blank">00:17:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If you don't know any of this, you have to hire legal counsel, and that's not cheap. And so there are people then who maybe have had small losses, but to them they're huge losses, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=1052" target="_blank">00:17:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, if you only have $200,000 to your name and you're retiring with $200,000 and someone puts you in a really inappropriate investment and you lost half your wealth, does it make financial sense for somebody to go and seek out an attorney versus trying to navigate the system themselves?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=1071" target="_blank">00:17:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a great question. And that's part of the reason, another reason that I think the system is so very broken, because losses to people with small accounts, lower net worth, are much more damaging.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=1087" target="_blank">00:18:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And yet, it is much harder to get legal representation for those types of claims. So one of the things, I handle a lot of phone calls from people who just are looking for representation for a particularly small amount.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=1103" target="_blank">00:18:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I will refer them to either regulators to be able to try to help them. And sometimes those are folks who can get help from regulators. But another place I refer them to is securities or investment clinics that are at certain law schools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=1120" target="_blank">00:18:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That doesn't cover everyone, but there are clinics in Nevada, in New York, in Georgia, in Florida, and they can represent people outside their states, but they are looking for smaller cases that they can use as a teaching mechanism for law students.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=1144" target="_blank">00:19:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that could be a great way to be able to get representation for a small case.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=1150" target="_blank">00:19:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's go into problems that all investors face if they're going to decide that it's too complex, so they're going to hire an investment advisor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=1163" target="_blank">00:19:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And if they go down that path of hiring an investment advisor, what are some of the problems that all investors face?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=1173" target="_blank">00:19:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, all investors face the issue of being influenced by their advisor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=1182" target="_blank">00:19:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, your financial advisor is somebody who has a whole lot of information that you don't have, just like when you're talking to your doctor about surgery or you're talking to your lawyer about how to put together your estate plan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=1198" target="_blank">00:19:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We have a real asymmetry here and unequal relationship in terms of information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=1204" target="_blank">00:20:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So how do we deal with that? Well, I know when I go in and see my doctor, I tend not to quiz the doctor about all the different options for certain surgery, let's say.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=1217" target="_blank">00:20:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we tend to have a relationship of trust, but that only works when you have a real fiduciary relationship.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=1228" target="_blank">00:20:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's one issue, is that there's a lot of trust. And you have to disclose a lot of personal details. So that, again, creates a relationship of trust.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=1241" target="_blank">00:20:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You then have complexity. So you have a whole world of options out there for investing, and you're really looking to your investment advisor or your financial advisor to narrow that down for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=1256" target="_blank">00:20:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You want the advisor to be talking to you, thinking about you, and then giving you some more limited options. You don't want to be looking at 99,000 options. You want to look at five or three.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=1270" target="_blank">00:21:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the choice of those is very important, and that is in the power of the advisor. And those could include indexed funds, you know, just straight out total market index fund or an S&P 500 index fund.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=1289" target="_blank">00:21:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But those aren't the kinds of funds that generate a whole lot of fees for the advisor. So there's a real tension there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=1301" target="_blank">00:21:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, the advisor is obviously entitled to make a living wage and make an income. I mean, I don't expect people to work for me for free.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=1312" target="_blank">00:21:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's a tension there. And some of the research is very interesting in terms of disclosure of financial interests.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=1321" target="_blank">00:22:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So people who hear from, let's say, their advisor, "Oh, well, I'm going to get a commission for this sale," they will take that into account in their brains, but they won't take it into account enough.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=1338" target="_blank">00:22:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because, you know, they generally aren't told the actual dollar amount that the advisor will get.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=1344" target="_blank">00:22:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So they'll discount the advice, you know, in their heads some amount, but not the full amount.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=1351" target="_blank">00:22:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So sometimes, you know, even knowing that there is a conflict of interest or a different financial incentive for your advisor might not be enough, might make things kind of worse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=1363" target="_blank">00:22:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, it's interesting because I have this debate on Twitter all the time with financial advisors who are fiduciaries who are charging what I consider high fees.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=1373" target="_blank">00:22:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's this big debate that goes on. Everybody who knows me knows that I'm really against financial advisors who are charging 1%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=1380" target="_blank">00:23:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because when you break it down to a dollar amount, it's actually a lot more money to charge a client 1% per year every single year on their portfolio than it is to go out and buy, say, American funds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=1392" target="_blank">00:23:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And pay a commission one time, and then the fees after that are relatively low.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=1397" target="_blank">00:23:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Brokers do have the opportunities to not gouge clients using commissions if they do it correctly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=1403" target="_blank">00:23:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And a lot of times I hear the fee-only financial advisors who are fiduciaries saying, "Well, you know, commissions are bad.

there is a gigantic, multibillion-dollar industry out there that is designed to overcome your resistance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

family.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=3150" target="_blank">00:52:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This was kind of a family business, you know, the financial advisor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=3154" target="_blank">00:52:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So when she developed dementia, she signed a power of attorney to the wife of the financial advisor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=3160" target="_blank">00:52:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the wife and family took over her life and blocked her family, prevented her family from coming and having contact with her, and threatened the family when they said that they were thinking about establishing guardianship.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=3179" target="_blank">00:52:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was terrible. But the thing that the family did not know for another eight years until D, this person, died was that a number of them were the successor trustees.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=3193" target="_blank">00:53:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this financial advisor knew that because the financial advisor had a copy of the trust documents because accounts were in the name of the trust.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=3202" target="_blank">00:53:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So this person had done what she needed to do, but her desperate desire for independence and privacy undercut the entire plan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=3215" target="_blank">00:53:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And one other thing that I think is very useful, I received a call about a week ago from somebody who was just talking about setting up new accounts and just was asking for advice as an older investor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=3228" target="_blank">00:53:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the biggest thing that I think everyone should have is checks and balances.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=3234" target="_blank">00:53:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If you are an older person who doesn't have family or friends that you feel comfortable having knowledge of your finances, or maybe you just don't have family, set up a system with an accountant or a lawyer or a service to receive your bank statements and your investment accounts and make sure that you've got at least two who are not connected.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=3260" target="_blank">00:54:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then those people or entities can be just kind of keeping an eye out. Are you paying your mortgage? Are you keeping up with the electric bill and other bills? And are you suddenly investing in some crazy ass things? Or are you kind of chugging along the way you should be?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=3282" target="_blank">00:54:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Final question. This is a real topic of discussion at the SEC and FINRA, elder abuse. And there have been some new rules and some new laws that have been enacted. Can you briefly talk about some of the new rules and laws?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=3298" target="_blank">00:54:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Some of the most important things from the industry side and that the SEC is dealing with is how do we balance? What do we do as an industry when there are signs of financial exploitation of someone who's older?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=3316" target="_blank">00:55:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There are privacy provisions in the securities laws. So brokerage firms can't just go out and call a family member or report these issues because there are laws in place that protect the privacy of our financial accounts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=3332" target="_blank">00:55:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the SEC and Congress addressed some of this and in a number of different ways. One way is that you can now designate somebody and you should be asked on all of your accounts to designate a trusted contact person.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=3349" target="_blank">00:55:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that is somebody who you consent to your brokerage firm or your investment advisory firm contacting in case anything fishy happens. If you start calling, for example, and like a great aunt of mine did and start transferring money to the Nigerian prince because you're getting calls from this nice person over and over again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=3374" target="_blank">00:56:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The firm then could call this trusted contact about and say, hey, we just want to let you know that this is happening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=3382" target="_blank">00:56:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, that didn't happen with my great aunt. And unfortunately, a lot of money went to the Nigerian prince before we had any idea that this was happening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=3394" target="_blank">00:56:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, this is a FINRA amendment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=3396" target="_blank">00:56:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That is right. So it is just for brokerage firms that that would apply. So that's an important factor. There are other things that are being looked into in terms of permitting brokerage firms to be able to put holds on accounts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=3411" target="_blank">00:56:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We are struggling here with the rights of older investors who may develop disabilities. They have a right to make bad decisions, to be able to maintain their autonomy and do things maybe that that somebody else might question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=3433" target="_blank">00:57:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But this is a really tough situation to be in. And it's tough for anybody. It's tough for lawyers to be struggling with somebody who is showing signs of having cognitive impairments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=3448" target="_blank">00:57:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The Americans with Disabilities Act protects people with disabilities and folks have the right to as much autonomy as they can handle. And they can't be discriminated against because of that disability.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=3463" target="_blank">00:57:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">On the flip side, we have trillions of dollars in the hands of older folks who've saved it up their whole lives. And it's a tempting target for fraudsters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=3475" target="_blank">00:57:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm going to just sum things up here a little bit. The way to prevent this is to prevent it before going in. In other words, prevent it from happening as opposed to trying to unwind it after it happens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=3489" target="_blank">00:58:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because after it happens, it can be, number one, devastating to seniors. And number two, it could take years to unwind it. That's even if you have an attorney. So the idea is prevention.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=3504" target="_blank">00:58:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Absolutely. That's why I do what I do. It is very tough to have to talk to lots and lots and lots of people who call. And I can't help them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=3517" target="_blank">00:58:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that breaks my heart. And so that's why I go to Washington. And that's why I talk with you. And that's why I publish things, because I want that to happen less.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbdnp6Qg65A&t=3527" target="_blank">00:58:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, Lisa, it's been really a wonderful conversation.
