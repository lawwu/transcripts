I've been doing a lot of tests with video and audio to figure out like what's the best way to do this and how do I do it as cheaply as possible 'cause again, I'm still unemployed. And so I did a few things. For recording the video, I'm using a MacBook Pro. This is just my personal machine. I'm using Zoom and I tested QuickTime. Zoom is cool. If you have the ability to record to your desktop, it's great. You get an audio and video file. I haven't done video edits yet, but I assume it'll be helpful once I get to that part of the process. And then I use QuickTime. QuickTime seems to be great. So I think for my solo videos, I'm gonna do QuickTime. And then when I do my interviews, I'm gonna use Zoom. And that was the first part of it. I did some video tests and then it came down to equipment and lighting. Again, I wear glasses, so I can't do big green lights everywhere 'cause you'll see it on my glasses. And my house is not very well decorated. I don't have these really cool, interesting backgrounds like most YouTubers have. I'll probably need to figure that out and stage something or maybe get a green screen or a backdrop. So this, again, I'm gonna be in this room until I figure something better. And I'm not sure if the doors and the walls are too busy, so I might shoot some video with just maybe a solid background. Like maybe when I'm interviewing people, so it's less distracting. I don't know. Still trying to figure that out. I did realize also lighting was important 'cause the natural light, obviously it differs by time of day. I'm finding that 10 to 11 a.m. is really, really good 'cause the sun's not super hot or bright and seems to be the most consistent. So that's what I'm gonna do. I think that's gonna be my window. So every day I'm gonna prepare as much as I can. The next day I know that this 10 to 12 slot is like my video shooting window. I have canned lights in the ceiling, like the recessed lights, and it's right above me. And so it casts a crazy shadow. And so I'm trying to figure that out. You might be wondering, "Whoa, why not just take off your hat?" Funny story, I don't know how I never noticed before, I can't keep my hairstyle consistent. There's some days I wake up, I've got a cowlick and I can't get it down, doesn't matter how much product. There's some days where my hair looks amazing. It's like, "Oh my God, "if I can shoot all the videos at once, that'd be great." 'Cause it's just perfectly coiffed. It's doing its thing. It's like, right? And then the most normal days, like it doesn't look like that. It's like, it's all inconsistent. So I might default to this hat situation. Maybe eventually I have a brand cap or something like that, but then this is just one less thing for me to worry about. I'm aware of things like shadow. And so again, someone who's more of a video purist, like they might critique me on that. I did notice because my lights above me are really, really hot, my forehead shines. And so maybe I need to use like some powder from my wife or something. I did put a piece of paper over the can light to kind of soften it a little bit. The first major purchase I made though was this. This is a Blue Yeti mic. I got this off of Amazon. Again, I looked at all my options available. My budget, quite frankly, I was like, "Dude, I need to spend something that's $120 or less." And I'm at home, so I've always got people running around. Hi. Anyways, that's life, right? So basically, this Blue Yeti mic, it's about 120 on Amazon. But then there's a sale right now for like $99. And then Best Buy price matched it. And so I got this one at Best Buy 'cause if I wanna return to the store, maybe it's easier. It does allow me to change the gain and has different modes. So if I were to ever sit across from a guest, we would use the same one. It's just easy to do and has a mute button because I don't know, maybe sometimes I wanna scratch my nose or whatever it is, I bump something and I just need to mute it. Or I have kids walking around my room like they do right now. So that's my first major purchase. So far, I'm pretty happy with it. The quality of it seems pretty good. I probably need to get a foam thing so it does my P pronunciations, don't shock the microphone. But this is where I'm at. This is my first purchase, guys.</p></div></div></body></html>
