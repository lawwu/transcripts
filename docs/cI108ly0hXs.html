Indeed, when Sam Altman had fun speculation about what GPTs will be doing the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cI108ly0hXs&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.040</a></span> | <span class="t">best by the end of today, he had his own theory. There are incredibly useful GPTs in the store,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cI108ly0hXs&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">but probably everything is waifus runs away with it.

I would test out one of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cI108ly0hXs&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">GPTs, like Write For Me, and that GPT says it can do relevant and precise word counts. I tried</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cI108ly0hXs&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">multiple times and every time it failed on word counts. I'm not trying to pick on one GPT, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cI108ly0hXs&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">very often using one of the GPTs wasn't really an improvement on just using GPT-4. There was,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cI108ly0hXs&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">however, one notable exception to that, which was the Consensus GPT.

The reason I say that is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cI108ly0hXs&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">that it was leaked/announced by someone not from OpenAI.

And what we also learned from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cI108ly0hXs&t=649" target="_blank">00:10:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">this article is that battle to control data is not just being waged by OpenAI or even OpenAI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cI108ly0hXs&t=656" target="_blank">00:10:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and Google.

Being an AI researcher. That's at 2063. Of course, that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cI108ly0hXs&t=1025" target="_blank">00:17:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the 50% prediction.

Indeed,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cI108ly0hXs&t=1057" target="_blank">00:17:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">one of the things they're working on is trying to align the model that's going to solve alignment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cI108ly0hXs&t=1062" target="_blank">00:17:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But the point is, look at their timeline.

Four years, five years, 10 years. Now I get that alignment research isn't all of AI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cI108ly0hXs&t=1090" target="_blank">00:18:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">research and there's a lot more there, but these four year, five year, 10 year goals seem a big</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cI108ly0hXs&t=1096" target="_blank">00:18:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">stretch from a 40 year expectation of the automation of AI research. One of these two dates</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cI108ly0hXs&t=1103" target="_blank">00:18:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">is going to be pretty dramatically wrong. Now for a few more interesting little highlights before we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cI108ly0hXs&t=1109" target="_blank">00:18:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">close out.

You get much more conservative answers than if you ask,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cI108ly0hXs&t=1124" target="_blank">00:18:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">give me the year by which we'll have a 50% chance of superintelligence. In a related study,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cI108ly0hXs&t=1130" target="_blank">00:18:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">when people were asked about the chances of AI going wrong, when they were asked for a percentage,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cI108ly0hXs&t=1136" target="_blank">00:18:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">they said 5%. When they were asked for a fraction, it was one in 15 million. Now, of course, these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cI108ly0hXs&t=1142" target="_blank">00:19:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">weren't the same people, otherwise they'd be pretty bad at mathematics.

But I guess the take home here is that human</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cI108ly0hXs&t=1156" target="_blank">00:19:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">psychology and anchoring is still playing an immense role when we talk about timelines and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cI108ly0hXs&t=1162" target="_blank">00:19:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">predictions. Here's another fascinating highlight. The researchers were asked about the possibility</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cI108ly0hXs&t=1167" target="_blank">00:19:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">of an intelligence explosion.
