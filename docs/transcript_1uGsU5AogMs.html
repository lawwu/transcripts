So one is 0% APR credit cards. Some credit cards offer 12 to 18 months of no interest on purchases, sometimes on balance transfers. Usually you're gonna make a minimum payment, but you're not gonna have to make the full payment.</p><p>And so this could be a great backup emergency buffer for circumstances where you all of a sudden need some cash and you don't wanna have to sell your investment accounts. You could take advantage of 0% APR credit cards. Now, there's no guarantee that they will be around when you need them.</p><p>There's no guarantee you will get approved for them. And so obviously these strategies are advanced because they come with some risk, but it is something that I know people have been able to take advantage of in those circumstances where they wanted to avoid selling from their taxable brokerage account.</p></div></div></body></html>
