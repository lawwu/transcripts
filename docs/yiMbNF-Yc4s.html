So I'll open up the question for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiMbNF-Yc4s&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the panel on the question that came up about asset allocation. Which one? Oh, which one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiMbNF-Yc4s&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">was it? You guys tell me. Rebalancing. Rebalancing, sorry. Rebalancing, yes. The question was,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiMbNF-Yc4s&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.240</a></span> | <span class="t">how often should you rebalance? Well, first, should you rebalance? How often should you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiMbNF-Yc4s&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.800</a></span> | <span class="t">rebalance? Quarterly? Annually? Bans? And so forth. And then the panel was asked to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiMbNF-Yc4s&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">comment.

I think less is more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiMbNF-Yc4s&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">when it comes to rebalancing, but I like the idea. Vanguard has done some nice research</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiMbNF-Yc4s&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.460</a></span> | <span class="t">on this topic too, where you just do that annual check-in, and I think once or twice</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiMbNF-Yc4s&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.840</a></span> | <span class="t">a year is plenty. See how much your portfolio has diverged from your targets. Five percentage</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiMbNF-Yc4s&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">points seems reasonable. Vanguard's research generally supports the rebalancing at five</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiMbNF-Yc4s&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.320</a></span> | <span class="t">percentage point divergences.

I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiMbNF-Yc4s&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.600</a></span> | <span class="t">am also a big fan of paying attention to the sub-rebalancing that you can do. So at various</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiMbNF-Yc4s&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">points in time, even though maybe your equity allocation is five percentage points above</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiMbNF-Yc4s&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">your target, you've got specific holdings that have really been the drivers of that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiMbNF-Yc4s&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.400</a></span> | <span class="t">strong performance. So starting your rebalancing there. I also tend to find rebalancing really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiMbNF-Yc4s&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">effective when I sync it up. I help my mom with her RMDs, and so syncing up the rebalancing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiMbNF-Yc4s&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.960</a></span> | <span class="t">process with that RMD process, we're always trimming whatever has performed best for her.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiMbNF-Yc4s&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.800</a></span> | <span class="t">That's where we go for her RMDs. So just a couple of thoughts on that front, but I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiMbNF-Yc4s&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.360</a></span> | <span class="t">guess I generally agree that less is more. I used to think that picking an asset allocation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiMbNF-Yc4s&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.760</a></span> | <span class="t">was the most important decision, and I've changed my mind. It's committing to stick</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiMbNF-Yc4s&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">to an asset allocation that is even more important. If you look at the Morningstar data over the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiMbNF-Yc4s&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.960</a></span> | <span class="t">last 10 years, you'll just see that the average investor return was 2.49% below the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiMbNF-Yc4s&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">average fund return. So picking a band, and generally I think five percentage points is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiMbNF-Yc4s&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.760</a></span> | <span class="t">really good, and sticking to it, actually over the long run, it's a risk management</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiMbNF-Yc4s&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.160</a></span> | <span class="t">strategy, but it's also a market timing strategy that then happens to work. You're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiMbNF-Yc4s&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.760</a></span> | <span class="t">over the long run selling what's performed best, and buying what's performed the worst.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiMbNF-Yc4s&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Contrary in my income.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiMbNF-Yc4s&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Rebalancing is definitely a topic about which I do not have strong feelings.

I don't think that's the right idea for young people. I think that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiMbNF-Yc4s&t=597" target="_blank">00:09:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">starting them out low in stocks and then letting them gradually build as they go through a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiMbNF-Yc4s&t=602" target="_blank">00:10:02.760</a></span> | <span class="t">few fair markets might be actually a better idea.

It's nice. It sounds good. And I'll also tell you that the volatility</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiMbNF-Yc4s&t=626" target="_blank">00:10:26.760</a></span> | <span class="t">of a 60/40/40 portfolio is much higher than the volatility of a 30/70 portfolio. I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiMbNF-Yc4s&t=632" target="_blank">00:10:32.760</a></span> | <span class="t">it's significantly higher in the variability of that volatility, meaning that if you were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiMbNF-Yc4s&t=636" target="_blank">00:10:36.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to look at it in your period of time, the volatility is twice as much in a 60/40 as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiMbNF-Yc4s&t=641" target="_blank">00:10:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">it is in a 70/30.

So in my opinion, there needs to be a lot more work done and maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiMbNF-Yc4s&t=673" target="_blank">00:11:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">some better language out there about the benefit of rebalancing.

sophisticated,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiMbNF-Yc4s&t=4243" target="_blank">01:10:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">who doesn't get into all this stuff too much,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiMbNF-Yc4s&t=4246" target="_blank">01:10:46.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm in the camp of doing the same allocation in both accounts, taxable versus non-taxable,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiMbNF-Yc4s&t=4252" target="_blank">01:10:52.760</a></span> | <span class="t">because it's simple for them and they won't fixate on performance of one account.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiMbNF-Yc4s&t=4256" target="_blank">01:10:56.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you do a balanced fund, for example, in both accounts,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiMbNF-Yc4s&t=4259" target="_blank">01:10:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">as opposed to trying to do stocks in a taxable account and bonds in a retirement account</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiMbNF-Yc4s&t=4265" target="_blank">01:11:05.760</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiMbNF-Yc4s&t=4269" target="_blank">01:11:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it's sophistication level also of the individual that matters here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiMbNF-Yc4s&t=4274" target="_blank">01:11:14.760</a></span> | <span class="t">The final question is for Rick
