Let's do one more question here. What are we at? We're rolling along here. Let's do one more deep work question. This one is from Sparky. Sparky says, in a 2014 blog post, you talked about temporary plans. As I am a professor as well, these longer two to three week plans seem more useful than a purely weekly plan for occasions like end of the semester or a period before spring break or a big conference travel.</p><p>Do you have any updated tips or advice for these? I do, Sparky. So when I used to talk about temporary plans, these were either habits you were temporarily trying out or work heuristics or plans that apply to a time delimited period, like the next month or the next two or three weeks.</p><p>And I used to email these to myself. They'd be in my inbox, temporary plans, and so I could see them in there. The main change I've made, Sparky, is I don't do that anymore. I just have the temporary plans live on my weekly plan. And when I redo my weekly plan, I'm like, yeah, this temporary plan is still in effect, so I'll just keep it there.</p><p>And I used to email my weekly plans to myself. Now I print them out. Now I just keep-- I don't want to have to look in my inbox at any occasion when I don't have to. So that's my one change, is just have that live on your weekly plan.</p><p>At the top of your weekly plan, you can even label them as ongoing or temporary plans. And I just have a Word document where my last weekly plan exists, and I just update it. When I update it, there's a lot of these bigger picture temporary plan or heuristic type things that I just keep there.</p><p>So that'd be my only change. (upbeat music)</p></div></div></body></html>
