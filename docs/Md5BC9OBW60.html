something to her partner like, I just feel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.160</a></span> | <span

our cultural stigma around men showing emotion, he has told himself like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=97" target="_blank">00:01:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah, this bothers me or that bothers me or I'm unhappy in this way, but I don't feel anything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=101" target="_blank">00:01:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Our marriage is good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So he doesn't even understand why he's there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And he thinks he's there for her because she insisted on it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And so when we finally get to maybe something that he's feeling and he finally does open</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">up, it's so interesting because maybe he's sharing something very vulnerable or maybe he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">tears up a little bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can tell like your body will tell you what you're feeling, even if you aren't aware</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">of it, you see, okay, there's some moisture there in his eyes or maybe a tear falls or maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">he actually starts crying.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And her reaction and her whole reason for bringing him in was, you know, I need you to open up to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=138" target="_blank">00:02:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=138" target="_blank">00:02:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to feel connected to you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=139" target="_blank">00:02:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to understand your inner life more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, he does it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And she then looks at me like a deer in headlights, like, oh, wow, I don't feel safe when he doesn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">open up to me, but I also don't feel safe when he's being vulnerable in this way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=155" target="_blank">00:02:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And these are sort of gender stereotypes that we think we might not fall prey to, but we do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it's so interesting that often men are the ones who seem sort of numb or calm,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">right, which are two, again, very different things in the relationship.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">But that's not really the case.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">It's that there's no room for him to express anything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So he has to kind of push everything down, probably, again, outside of his awareness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the couple feels disconnected and both of them are unhappy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.240</a></span> | <span class="t">This idea that more words means more emotional, I don't buy it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, exactly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, it's interesting because men will come in if I'm seeing them alone and they'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.280</a></span> | <span class="t">often say something like, I've never told anyone this before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And they literally mean, I've never told anyone this before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Because when men hang out, they're not, it's not the same sort of level of let's talk, talk,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Women will come in and say something like, I've never told anyone this before,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">except for my mother, my sister, my best friend, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So they've told maybe one, two or three people, but they feel like they haven't told anyone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Because for women, that's kind of not telling anyone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, now you have people concerned.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So if somebody, if a woman says to me, I didn't tell anyone, that means she only told four people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't mean secrets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't mean

themselves, where they feel maybe hesitant to share that, or they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">feel ashamed about that, or they're not sure about something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can see that difference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But I also think it happens very early.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

I grew</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">up with a brother, but I didn't

really trying to work through it linearly, like a challenge, like a life</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=597" target="_blank">00:09:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">challenge, is so valuable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=598" target="_blank">00:09:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And I didn't come up with this on my own.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=602" target="_blank">00:10:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I now have a practice of, like, when something feels irritating or activating, I'll just, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=607" target="_blank">00:10:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">stop, put everything away and just sit and think, like, what's going on here?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=611" target="_blank">00:10:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And inevitably, there's some, like, some growth in understanding at the end of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=616" target="_blank">00:10:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's hard work, like, to think, like, what's going on here?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=620" target="_blank">00:10:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Am I activated because it's, like, true?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=623" target="_blank">00:10:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Am I activated because it's false?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=624" target="_blank">00:10:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Mm-hmm.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=625" target="_blank">00:10:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Am I, you know, like, having to sort all that, you might think, well, who has the time for this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=628" target="_blank">00:10:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But actually, I would argue you don't have the time to not do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=631" target="_blank">00:10:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that's the difference between reacting and responding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=634" target="_blank">00:10:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So often what we do is we react to something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=636" target="_blank">00:10:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's not processed, not thought through.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=640" target="_blank">00:10:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, it doesn't have to take, like you're saying, it doesn't have to take a long time to just even count to five and breathe and see, you know, because reacting, reacting means acting again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=652" target="_blank">00:10:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So you are normally, when you're reacting, and it's like that zero to 60, you're acting on something that happened in the past, and you're layering it on to whatever's happening in the present.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=663" target="_blank">00:11:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So you're having a big reaction to something, we like to say if it's historical, if it's hysterical, it's historical, meaning if you're, and by hysterical, I mean if you're having a big reaction, there's probably something from your past, some reaction that is visceral to you that you're having, that is getting layered on to this current situation, experience, problem, and you don't realize it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=687" target="_blank">00:11:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's reacting, you're acting again, you're acting on something that happened in the past, if it's hysterical, it's historical.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=692" target="_blank">00:11:32.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Responding is, I'm going to take a breath, I'm having a big reaction, I'm going to sit for a minute, again, regulating your nervous system, and now I can kind of think about this differently.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=704" target="_blank">00:11:44.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So we need space between, you know, there's that famous Viktor Frankl quote of, you know, between stimulus and response, there is a space, and in that space lies our choice and our freedom, that's a paraphrase of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=717" target="_blank">00:11:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But you need that space between the stimulus, whatever the thing is that activated you, and your response.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=724" target="_blank">00:12:04.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's the difference between reacting and responding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md5BC9OBW60&t=727" target="_blank">00:12:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's the difference between reacting and responding.</span></div></div></body></html>
