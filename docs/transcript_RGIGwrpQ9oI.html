And in that sense, Conquest's law can't even hold there. So once I had a debate with Mark Andreessen about this, I think Mark tends to see left-wing, right-wing, wherever your views might be, as somewhat universal historical categories.</p><p>And I very much do not. So in medieval times, what's left-wing, what's right-wing? Even 17th century England, there are like particular groups who on particular issues are very left or right-wing. It seems to me unsatisfying, and there's a lot of fluidity in how these axes play out over real issues.</p><p>Something insightful I heard from Bernd Hobart is that if the left keeps winning, then just redefine what the left is. So if you think of prohibition, right, at the time it was a left-wing cause, right, now the opposite of prohibition is a left-wing cause, so then just change what left is.</p><p>Exactly. There seem to be a lot of cases where Conquest's law is not so economical. No, Napoleon is a great example of this, where it's not sure whether, is he the most left-wing figure in history or the most right-wing figure in history? We both somehow, yes.</p></div></div></body></html>
