When we're talking about the dichotomous view of man, we're talking about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i355A2pN5s&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the idea that man is material and immaterial, that man has a body and a soul. A man has an outer man,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i355A2pN5s&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">which is his physical body, and man has an inner man, which is referred to by various terms such</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i355A2pN5s&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">as heart, soul, spirit, mind. All of that refers to the inner man, the immaterial aspect of man.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i355A2pN5s&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And by man, I'm referring to humanity broadly. I'm not using the term man to refer to gender,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i355A2pN5s&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.760</a></span> | <span class="t">but I'm using it in the way that the Old Testament uses the Hebrew term adam in reference to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i355A2pN5s&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">humanity. And so when we're talking about man is material and immaterial, we're saying that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i355A2pN5s&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">man has a physical aspect, a physical component, and also an immaterial aspect. Man has an inner</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i355A2pN5s&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">man or the soul, and that's what we mean by the dichotomous view of man, that man has two aspects</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i355A2pN5s&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">or two facets to his being, although man is an essential unity. So we can never really distinguish,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i355A2pN5s&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">like if I'm talking to my wife, I don't say, "Well, I'm going to talk to the physical aspect</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i355A2pN5s&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">of my wife," but not talk to the immaterial aspect of my wife. If I'm having a conversation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i355A2pN5s&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">with my wife, she's hearing me using physical ears, but she's also hearing me from the heart.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i355A2pN5s&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there is a difficulty in knowing sometimes where does the physical aspect of man end</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i355A2pN5s&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and the immaterial aspect of man begin? Because man is an essential unity, it's sometimes hard</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i355A2pN5s&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.720</a></span> | <span class="t">to figure all of that out, like which side of me is reacting to this? Is my physical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i355A2pN5s&t=319" target="_blank">00:05:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">nature reacting to what I'm seeing before me, or is it my heart that's reacting to what's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i355A2pN5s&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">before me? And in most cases, it's both because you're an essential unity. Man is essential unity,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i355A2pN5s&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">although he has a body and a soul. I think that perspective of man being</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i355A2pN5s&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">immaterial and material is so foundational for counseling.

He talks about those sufferings in 2 Corinthians 4 verse 8, where he says, "We are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i355A2pN5s&t=387" target="_blank">00:06:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but not driven to despair; persecuted, but not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i355A2pN5s&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed; always carrying in the body the death of Jesus, so that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i355A2pN5s&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our bodies."
