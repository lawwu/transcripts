It may not be super interesting from the outside, but if you're on like the inside of a building, it's really nice to have a whole, you know, a large open space to walk through and to have like a lot of like natural light.</p><p>That was very hard to do prior to like, you know, the mid-20th century, and because for a couple reasons. One is because buildings weren't really air-conditioned before that, and another one is like to have like big expanses of glass. It's still expensive, but it was like even more expensive.</p><p>It basically became a lot more possible to just have like your building as like a big giant slab of glass and have like a lot of natural light. It seems like it's maybe a case of the technology evolved such that you can create this nicer interior space to some extent that perhaps came at the expense of like having a lot of really ornate decoration on the outside.</p></div></div></body></html>
