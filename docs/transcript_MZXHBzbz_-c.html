Can you guys introduce yourself? Yeah, my name is Lance Burrows, and I'm an associate pastor at Countryside Bible Church in South Lake, Texas. All right, and how about you? I'm Jonathan Anderson. I'm also one of the pastors at Countryside there in South Lake. All right, awesome.</p><p>And you guys have been reading the LSB a little bit. What do you think? Yeah, we've been working through the LSB off and on for the last few years that it's been out. And to answer your question, I might want to take it a different direction just in terms of the readability of the typesetting.</p><p>I think I've told you before in our conversations that in my view, out of all of the Bibles that you can get, the LSB and what you guys have done in terms of typesetting and the clarity of the page and the organization of the text, I do think it's by far the best.</p><p>And that's the truth. How about yourself? Yeah, I mean, I appreciate tons about the LSB translation. I think as a pastor in our church, what I've appreciated most is just the high standard and commitment to excellence in translation that exalts the Word. You know, we want our congregation to know that God's Word is exalted, and we have a high view of it, and it's to be treated with the utmost respect and clarity.</p><p>And to have a translation that really reflects that is huge. So, yeah, really grateful for it and appreciate it personally and as a pastor. Hey, well, we appreciate you guys at Countryside. You guys are doing incredible ministry. We hear so many good things, so thank you guys for your faithful service and your love for Christ.</p><p>We appreciate it. Yeah, thanks, Gary. Thank you.</p></div></div></body></html>
