And when I was doing research, I read that similar thing happened in London as well for the Olympics there. And I think there's a window where it's far enough out that no one knows how crowded it's gonna be and prices are really expensive.</p><p>But actually as you get closer, they seem to come down a bit. So first off, if you're ever booking some big event, I'd encourage everyone to make a refundable reservation early so you have it just in case things are expensive. And so we looked at a lot of things.</p><p>This is where the hotel search tools also really, really shine, 'cause we knew exactly where we wanted to go.</p></div></div></body></html>
