What's going to be the highlight of my day today? Write it down and it's so helpful for making sure you have an awesome day and you get done the one thing that's most important.</p><p>Arguably, one of my favorite filters for whether something should be on the docket for today is applying the hell yes or no filter. And back in episode 109, I talked to Derek Sivers who wrote a book called Hell Yeah or No. And we had this amazing conversation. It's one of the more interesting episodes because I didn't have an agenda going into the episode.</p><p>We didn't have a specific topic we wanted to focus on. So often I'm like, ooh, I want to learn about gut health or I want to learn how to rethink elite status. In this one, I was just like, Derek Sivers is such a great modern philosopher.</p></div></div></body></html>
