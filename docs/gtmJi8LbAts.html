on a lot, but I certainly admire the passion and the dedication to stopping wars.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's something we want to talk about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's talk about how we got to this war.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So President Trump comes into office and immediately lays out that his Iran strategy is maximum pressure on the regime, and he will not allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.980</a></span> | <span class="t">He makes that clear consistently, which has multiple tracks, but the one that Trump sees most interested in at the time is the diplomatic track.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And he makes it very clear from the beginning in a sort of Oval Office remark says the Iranians can either blow up their nuclear program under U.S. supervision or someone's going to blow it up for them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And even though, you know, you know, at the time we think Netanyahu is really trying to push the president into a military campaign.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I'm sure we'll talk about that throughout the podcast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.360</a></span> | <span class="t">The president authorizes his lead negotiator and close friend, Steve Witkoff, to begin outreach to the Iranians and thus begun the Oman round.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's Oman round because it's taking place in Oman with mediation efforts by the Omanis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.720</a></span> | <span class="t">There are five rounds of negotiations with the Iranians.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And through the course of those negotiations, the U.S. finally puts on the table an offer for Iran.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.620</a></span> | <span class="t">We'll talk about the details of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.360</a></span> | <span class="t">The Iranians reject that offer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And we're now into the sixth round, which is supposed to take place on a Sunday.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.200</a></span> | <span class="t">On the Thursday before the Sunday, the Israelis strike and they go after in a rather devastating campaign over a matter of now 12 days.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.660</a></span> |

class="t">All these sites were discovered by Iranian opposition groups, by Western intelligence agencies, and the International Atomic Energy Agency, which is the UN agency responsible for preventing proliferation, has come out again and again over many, many years in reports, very detailed reports, describing Iran's nuclear weapons program.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=743" target="_blank">00:12:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">There have been multiple attempts at diplomacy with Iran.</span></div><div

about the JCPOA, which was the 2015 deal that Barack Obama reached with Iran, but multiple attempts to actually get the Iranians to negotiate away their nuclear weapons program.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=762" target="_blank">00:12:42.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, it's worth mentioning that if Iran wanted to have civilian nuclear energy, there are 23 countries in the world that have it, but they don't have enrichment and they don't have reprocessing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=772" target="_blank">00:12:52.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, we sign these deals called the gold standard with the South Koreans, with the Emiratis, with others, and we say, if you want civilian energy, you can have power plants, you can buy your fuel rods from abroad, but there's no reason to have enrichment or plutonium reprocessing because those are the key capabilities you need to develop nuclear weapons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=792" target="_blank">00:13:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, the five countries that have those capabilities and don't have nuclear weapons are Argentina, Brazil, Holland, Germany, and Japan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=802" target="_blank">00:13:22.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think it's the view of many administrations over many years, including many European leaders, that the Islamic Republic of Iran is very different from those aforementioned countries because it has been dedicated to terrorism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=816" target="_blank">00:13:36.260</a></span> | <span class="t">It's been killing Americans

that President Trump had said, here's the offer, take it or leave it, zero enrichment, full dismantlement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=840" target="_blank">00:14:00.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, in fact, that wasn't the offer that was presented to the Iranians at Oman.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=843" target="_blank">00:14:03.860</a></span> | <span class="t">The offer was a one-page offer, and it said you can temporarily enrich above ground.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=849" target="_blank">00:14:09.380</a></span> |

target="_blank">00:14:14.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And then at some time in the future, three, four years, as Scott said, there'll be a consortium that'll be built, not on Iranian territory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=862" target="_blank">00:14:22.580</a></span> | <span class="t">It'll be a partnership with

under IAEA supervision.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=867" target="_blank">00:14:27.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And that enrichment facility will create fuel rods for your nuclear reactors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=872" target="_blank">00:14:32.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So that was the offer presented to Iran.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=874" target="_blank">00:14:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And that offer would come with significant sanctions relief, billions of dollars that would go to the regime.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=880" target="_blank">00:14:40.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Obviously, the economy there has been suffering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=882" target="_blank">00:14:42.900</a></span> | <span class="t">The regime has not had the resources that it's had in the past to fund its, what I call its axis of misery, its proxy terror armies around the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=892" target="_blank">00:14:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was a good offer, and I was shocked that Khamenei rejected it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=897" target="_blank">00:14:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">He did reject it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=899" target="_blank">00:14:59.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think he rejected it because I think he believed that he could continue to do to President Trump what he had done to President Obama, which is just continue to squeeze and squeeze and squeeze the Americans at the table in order to ensure that he could keep all these nuclear facilities, all these nuclear capabilities, so that at a time of his choosing, when President Trump is gone, he can develop nuclear weapons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=921" target="_blank">00:15:21.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, it is a bit interesting to say that Iran has no intention to develop nuclear weapons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=926" target="_blank">00:15:26.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's examine the nuclear program and ask, does this sound like a regime that's not interested in building nuclear weapons?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=934" target="_blank">00:15:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So they built deeply buried underground enrichment facilities that they hid from the international community, and they didn't disclose.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=942" target="_blank">00:15:42.360</a></span> | <span class="t">They had an active nuclear warhead program called the MAD, which ended in 2003, formally, when the United States invaded Iraq.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=952" target="_blank">00:15:52.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And we know that because not only has that been detailed by the IAEA, but actually Mossad, in a daring operation in Tehran, took out a nuclear archive and brought it back to the West.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=965" target="_blank">00:16:05.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the IAEA, the United States and the intelligence communities went after this detailed archive, went into it and discovered that this Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, had an active program to build five atomic warheads.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=980" target="_blank">00:16:20.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was a very detailed program with blueprints and designs, all of which was designed under Ahmad to build a nuclear weapons program.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=989" target="_blank">00:16:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So, again, it's interesting to say that he doesn't have the intention to build nuclear weapons when he actually had an active nuclear weapons program.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=996" target="_blank">00:16:36.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And we can talk about what happened to that program after 2003, and there's a lot of interesting details.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1001" target="_blank">00:16:41.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So, when you combine the fact that he has an active nuclear weapons program, he has sites that are buried deep underground, he has weapons scientists who come out of the Ahmad program and continue to work on the initial metallurgy work and computer modeling designed to actually begin that process of building a warhead.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1023" target="_blank">00:17:03.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And all of this has been hidden from the international community, he has spent estimates of a half a trillion dollars on his nuclear program in direct costs and in sanctions costs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1035" target="_blank">00:17:15.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And one has to ask, and I think it's an interesting question, to compare the UAE and Iran.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1041" target="_blank">00:17:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">The UAE signed the gold standard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1043" target="_blank">00:17:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">They said we'll have no enrichment capability or reprocessing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1046" target="_blank">00:17:26.900</a></span> | <span class="t">They spent about $20 billion on that, and it supplies 25% of their electrical generation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1054" target="_blank">00:17:34.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Khamenei spent a half a trillion dollars, and that program supplies maybe 3% of their electrical needs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1064" target="_blank">00:17:44.760</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, they have a reactor that they bought from the Russians called Boucher, and that reactor, it's exactly what you'd want in a proliferation-proof reactor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1073" target="_blank">00:17:53.540</a></span> | <span class="t">They buy fuel rods from the Russians, they use it, and they send the spent fuel back to Russia so it cannot be reprocessed into plutonium.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1080" target="_blank">00:18:00.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So I just think it's important for your listeners to understand just some of the technical nuclear history here in order to unpack this question of, did Khamenei want nuclear weapons?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1091" target="_blank">00:18:11.380</a></span> | <span class="t">What was his goal here?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1093" target="_blank">00:18:13.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we can talk about, was this the right operation in order for the United States to order the B-2 bombers to strike these facilities in what, again, was a limited operation, as President Trump has said, and in order to drive the Iranians back to the negotiating table and finally do the deal that President Trump has asked them to do since he came into office in January.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1115" target="_blank">00:18:35.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, that is one of the fascinating questions, whether this Operation Midnight Hammer increased or decreased the chance that Iran will develop a nuclear weapon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1124" target="_blank">00:18:44.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Before you ask any more questions, I have to refute virtually everything he just said, which is completely false.</span></div><div

There was not one thing I said that was true? Just one thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1132" target="_blank">00:18:52.420</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, Iran is a nation over there somewhere. You got that part right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1135" target="_blank">00:18:55.740</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. 22 years of working on Iran, and I got that right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1138" target="_blank">00:18:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But do you know the population of Iran?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1140" target="_blank">00:19:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">92 million.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1141" target="_blank">00:19:01.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1142" target="_blank">00:19:02.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So, first of all, they were trying to buy a light water reactor from the Europeans or the Chinese in the 1990s, and Bill Clinton wouldn't let them and put tremendous pressure on China to prevent them from selling them a light water reactor, a turnkey reactor that produces waste that's so polluted with impurities that you can't make nuclear weapons fuel out of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1163" target="_blank">00:19:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">By the way, they never have, to this day, had a reprocessing facility for reprocessing plutonium, even their current plutonium waste from their heavy water reactor at Boucher, to make weapons fuel out of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1175" target="_blank">00:19:35.180</a></span> | <span class="t">They have no plutonium route to the bomb under the JCPOA.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1177" target="_blank">00:19:37.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But they have that at Iraq, not Boucher. There's a difference between Iraq. Iraq is a reactor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1181" target="_blank">00:19:41.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Iraq is where they pour concrete into the reactor and shut it down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1185" target="_blank">00:19:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reason they pour concrete-</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1187" target="_blank">00:19:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Under the JCPOA.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1187" target="_blank">00:19:47.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Not they, but the Obama administration is right. Under the JCPOA, poured concrete into the Calendria in order to prevent them from using that reactor to reprocess plutonium.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1198" target="_blank">00:19:58.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So, there's a distinction between Iraq and Boucher. Scott's exactly right. Boucher is a reactor, a heavy water reactor provided by the Russians, as I described, for the generation of electricity. It's proliferation proof. Iraq is the opposite.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1213" target="_blank">00:20:13.720</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a heavy water reactor that was built for a plutonium pathway to nuclear weapons, which is exactly why, under the JCPOA, they literally had to pour concrete into the middle of it to prevent it from reprocessing plutonium.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1225" target="_blank">00:20:25.060</a></span> | <span class="t">I think we're going to need a scientist to come in here and split the difference, or maybe we need to go and look up some IAEA documents, because I don't believe that Iraq ever had a reprocessing facility for their plutonium waste.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1239" target="_blank">00:20:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And the deal under the JCPOA, the Russians would come and get all their plutonium waste, which the waste comes out all polluted and not useful. You need the reprocessing facility to get all of the impurities out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1251" target="_blank">00:20:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">It could be that I'm wrong about that, but I don't believe that they ever had a reprocessing facility at Iraq that they could use to remove all those impurities and then have weapons-grade plutonium fuel, as the North Koreans do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1265" target="_blank">00:21:05.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So the Obama administration was very clear under the JCPOA, we are going to pour concrete into the Iraq facility, as Scott acknowledged, because we are concerned that Iraq can be used for reprocessing plutonium, for a plutonium pathway to a nuclear weapon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1281" target="_blank">00:21:21.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Can be used, but we don't know if it was used.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1283" target="_blank">00:21:23.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, wait, no, it never was.

had actually come out, and for the first time in their annual threat assessment,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1399" target="_blank">00:23:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">had removed a line that said, Iran is not currently working on developing any capabilities that would put it in a position to actually deliver a nuclear warhead.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1413" target="_blank">00:23:33.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And what became the Lawrence Norman piece in the Wall Street Journal was that there actually was initial work done on metallurgy and on computer modeling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1422" target="_blank">00:23:42.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And so those actually were defined terms in Section T of the 2015 JCPOA, which defined weaponization in that section.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1431" target="_blank">00:23:51.100</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:23:54.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So the DNI was very concerned under Biden that these initial steps meant that either Khamenei had given the green lights or nuclear weapons scientists in order to get ahead of the boss.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1444" target="_blank">00:24:04.960</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:24:34.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Trump's director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, who issued her threat assessment in February that repeated the exact same language that from the national intelligence estimate of 2007 and that the CIA and the NIE, the National Intelligence Council, have reaffirmed repeatedly ever since then, which is that Supreme Leader has not decided to pursue nuclear weapons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1493" target="_blank">00:24:53.900</a></span> | <span class="t">He

target="_blank">00:24:56.840</a></span> | <span class="t">She testified, in fact, in in under oath in front of the Senate in March.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1502" target="_blank">00:25:02.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, according to CNN and The New York Times, there was a brand new that assessment that was put together the week before the attack was launched, reaffirming the same thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1514" target="_blank">00:25:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And at least in history, if you read it in Haaretz, Mossad agreed with the CIA.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1519" target="_blank">00:25:19.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I'd like to just sort of quote CIA director John Ratcliffe because Scott brought him brought up the CIA and the intelligence committee.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1525" target="_blank">00:25:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I think Ratcliffe had a good way of looking at this and that he said is, you know, when you're in the 99 yard line as a football team, you have the intention to score a goal, quote unquote.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1535" target="_blank">00:25:35.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And what he was what he was actually pointing to is let's not talk about this debate about whether Khamenei had given the order or not given the order, because Khamenei knows that if he gives an order, the U.S. and Israeli intelligence community will pick up on that order.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1548" target="_blank">00:25:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And that will be the trigger for strikes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1550" target="_blank">00:25:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">What what Ratcliffe is saying is that Khamenei had built the nuclear weapons capability.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1555" target="_blank">00:25:55.320</a></span> | <span class="t">He's at the 99 yard line and both the CIA and European leaders, European intelligence committee has said for years that if Iran has that capability and they're on the 99 yard line at that point, it's going to be too late to stop them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1570" target="_blank">00:26:10.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Once that decision is made to assemble the final warhead, which, by the way, is the final piece of what you need for a deliverable nuclear weapon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1577" target="_blank">00:26:17.960</a></span> | <span class="t">That's not true at all. Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1579" target="_blank">00:26:19.160</a></span> | <span class="t">They have to resort to a crude analogy about football yard lines because they can't say the truth, which is that they had zero weapons grade uranium.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1587" target="_blank">00:26:27.700</a></span> | <span class="t">They were not producing it. They were trying to get the United States back in the deal that they are still officially within the JCPOA with the rest of the U.N. Security Council, wherein they shipped all of their enriched uranium stockpile out of the country to France to be transferred to fuel rods.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1604" target="_blank">00:26:44.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Their insistence was on their continued ability to enrich uranium.</span></div><div

sort of brought up that deserves addressing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1616" target="_blank">00:26:56.840</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1625" target="_blank">00:27:05.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And he said the JCPOA was the worst deal in the history of any time any two men ever shook hands and all these kinds of things in his hyperbolic way, which, of course, made it very difficult for him to figure out a way to stay in the thing or to compromise along its lines.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1641" target="_blank">00:27:21.280</a></span> | <span class="t">But the fact of the matter is, if he had just played it straight and said, listen, Ayatollah, we don't have to be friends, but we do have a deal here, which my predecessor struck with you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1651" target="_blank">00:27:31.260</a></span> | <span class="t">But I don't like these sunset provisions and I want to send my guys over there and see if we can figure out a way to convince you that we really wish you'd shut down calm altogether or this or that or the other thing and try to approach them in good faith.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1665" target="_blank">00:27:45.880</a></span> | <span class="t">We talk about yard lines and things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1667" target="_blank">00:27:47.800</a></span> | <span class="t">We had a

past the 50 yard line.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1674" target="_blank">00:27:54.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Donald Trump could have gone to Tehran and shook hands with the Ayatollah as Dick Cheney complained that we had cold relations with Iran back in 1998 when he was the head of Alliburton.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1685" target="_blank">00:28:05.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we can do business with these guys.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1687" target="_blank">00:28:07.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Donald Trump could have gone

class="t">And instead, he gave into Netanyahu's lies in this ridiculous hoax that they had uncovered all these Iranian nuclear documents, which he pretends is legit, where all they did was recycle the fake Israeli forged smoking laptop of 2005, which they lied and pretended was the laptop of an Iranian scientist that was smuggled out of Iran by his wife and had all this proof of a secret Iranian nuclear weapons program on it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1719" target="_blank">00:28:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">But every bit of that was refuted, including the thing about the warhead, he said, was refuted by David Albright and his friend David Sanger in The New York Times.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1728" target="_blank">00:28:48.100</a></span> | <span class="t">That all those sketches of the warhead for the missile were wrong because when Mossad forged the documents, they were making a good educated guess, but they didn't know that Iran had completely redesigned the nose cone of their mid-range missiles and had an entirely different nose cone that would require an entirely different warhead than that described in the documents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1749" target="_blank">00:29:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And why would they have been designing a nose cone that they were abandoning?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1753" target="_blank">00:29:13.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that was refuted. David Albright completely discredited your claims there, pal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1757" target="_blank">00:29:17.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And then they later admitted that it was a CIA laptop. There was no laptop. And they later admitted, Ali Heinonen admitted, who was a very hawkish, one of the, not director, but a high-level executive at the International Atomic Energy Agency, admitted that that intelligence was brought into the stream by the Mujahideen E. Kalk, communist terrorist cult,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1779" target="_blank">00:29:39.900</a></span> | <span class="t">that used to work for the Ayatollah during the revolution, then turned on him and he turned on them and kicked them out.

Didn't bomb it. It was nothing. It was fake.

However, they were not in violation of their safeguards agreement with the IAEA.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1867" target="_blank">00:31:07.980</a></span> | <span class="t">They were still six months away from introducing any nuclear material to that facility.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1872" target="_blank">00:31:12.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so when it was revealed, they weren't in violation of anything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1876" target="_blank">00:31:16.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And and then on Kham, we had a huge fight about this at the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1881" target="_blank">00:31:21.740</a></span> | <span class="t">The party line came down in from all the government officials in the media that they had just exposed the facility.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1888" target="_blank">00:31:28.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Their commis photo. Same thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1890" target="_blank">00:31:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">When in fact, that wasn't true. The IAEA, the Iranians had announced to the IAEA that we have built a new facility here and we are going to introduce nuclear material into it within six months.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1903" target="_blank">00:31:43.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So here's your official notification. And then a few days later, they just pretended to expose it when it was the Iranians themselves who had admitted to it in in going along with their obligations under their safeguards agreement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1917" target="_blank">00:31:57.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's just completely wrong. Why do they bury them?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1920" target="_blank">00:32:00.260</a></span> | <span class="t">They buried them for protection, because clearly the Israelis have indicated since the 1990s that they consider any nuclear program in Iran to be the same thing as an advanced nuclear weapons program.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1931" target="_blank">00:32:11.220</a></span> | <span class="t">You're hearing that today for them to have a nuclear facility at all is is equivalent to them going ahead and breaking out and making a nuclear weapon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1939" target="_blank">00:32:19.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, of course, they know that they have to have it buried to protect it from Israel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1943" target="_blank">00:32:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It doesn't mean that they are trying to get nukes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1946" target="_blank">00:32:26.740</a></span> | <span class="t">It does mean, as I already said, that they wanted to prove to the world that they know how to enrich uranium and that they have facilities buried deeply enough where if we attack them, that would incentivize them to making nukes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1960" target="_blank">00:32:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, here's some more things that he said that weren't true.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1978" target="_blank">00:32:58.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So he said Iran has been killing Americans all this time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=1981" target="_blank">00:33:01.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, that's almost always a reference to Beirut 1983, which you can read in the book By Way of Deception by Viktor Ostrovsky, the former Mossad officer, that the Israelis knew that they were building that truck bomb to bomb the Marines with and withheld that information from the United States and said that's what they get for sticking their big noses in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2001" target="_blank">00:33:21.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And that is in the book By Way of Deception by Viktor Ostrovsky.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2005" target="_blank">00:33:25.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And by the way, the Israelis were friends with them at with Iran at the time in all through the 1980s.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2012" target="_blank">00:33:32.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was just a couple of years later when Ronald Reagan sold Iran missiles and using the Israelis as cutouts to do so when he switched sides temporarily in the Iran-Iraq war.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2022" target="_blank">00:33:42.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's just and that was in 1983.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2024" target="_blank">00:33:44.840</a></span> | <span class="t">If Ronald Reagan can sell them missiles a year or two years after that, three years after that, then surely the United States and the Ayatollah can bury the hatchet from that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2034" target="_blank">00:33:54.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And no one's ever even, I don't believe, ever really proven that Tehran ordered that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2038" target="_blank">00:33:58.240</a></span> | <span class="t">It was a Shiite militia backed by Iran that sort of proto-Hezbollah that did that attack, that killed those Marines.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2045" target="_blank">00:34:05.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And if there's some responsibility for them, damn them, like if there's direct responsibility for that, not just their support for the group, then damn them for that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2053" target="_blank">00:34:13.740</a></span> | <span class="t">But that's still no reason in the world to say that we can't get along with them now when that was in the same year Return of the Jedi came out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2060" target="_blank">00:34:20.200</a></span> | <span class="t">OK, and then the other one, and this is always referred to, you'll see this on TV news today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

Muqtada al-Sadr was a Shiite and close to Iran, but he's also an Iraqi nationalist.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2144" target="_blank">00:35:44.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And at times he allied with the Sunnis and tried to try to limit American and Iranian influence in the country, was more of an Arab and an Iraqi nationalist.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2154" target="_blank">00:35:54.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And the Americans decided they hated him the most, not because he was the most Iran tied, but because he was willing to tell us and them to to get the hell out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2163" target="_blank">00:36:03.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And America was betting that if we backed the same parties that Iran backed in Iraq War Two, that they would eventually end up needing our money and guns more than they would need their Iranian friends and co-religionists and sponsors next door, which, of course, did not work out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2176" target="_blank">00:36:16.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And America's had minimal influence in supermajority Shiite Iraq ever since the end of Iraq War Two.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2181" target="_blank">00:36:21.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And we can get back later in the show to how Israel helped lie us into that horrific war as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2187" target="_blank">00:36:27.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But the fact of the matter is, it was not Iranians setting off those bombs, and it was not even Iranians making those bombs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2193" target="_blank">00:36:33.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And I show in my book enough already.

they laid out all the components, all the reporters gathered around.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2224" target="_blank">00:37:04.120</a></span> | <span class="t">They started noticing that the components said made in UAE, made in Haditha, that is Iraq.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2229" target="_blank">00:37:09.320</a></span> | <span class="t">In other words, there was no evidence whatsoever that these came from Iran.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2233" target="_blank">00:37:13.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And then they called off the press conference and Stephen Hadley, George Bush's second national security advisor, admitted that, yeah, we didn't have the evidence that we needed to present that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2244" target="_blank">00:37:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And I also quote to one Marine and one high level army intelligence officer in there who were deeply involved in Iraq war, reconfirming that, that there was never any evidence that these bombs were coming across from Iran or especially that then, even if they were, that that was at the direction of the Quds Force or the Ayatollah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2266" target="_blank">00:37:46.340</a></span> | <span class="t">This was all just a propaganda campaign because Dick Cheney and David Petraeus were trying to give George Bush a reason to hit IRGC bases and start the war in 2007.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2275" target="_blank">00:37:55.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And this sounds crazy, but there's like four major confirming sources for it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2279" target="_blank">00:37:59.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Dick Cheney's national security advisor, David Wormser, who was the author of the Clean Break Strategy, which we're going to talk about today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2286" target="_blank">00:38:06.940</a></span> | <span class="t">David Wormser in 2007 was

was later confirmed in the New York Times and by the Washington Post reporter Barton Gelman in his book Angler on Dick Cheney, that there was this huge, this was the end that they were going for, was they were trying so hard to force a war in 2007.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2316" target="_blank">00:38:36.460</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2564" target="_blank">00:42:44.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Mark, do you want to comment on stuff a little bit here?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2567" target="_blank">00:42:47.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Pick whichever topic you want to go with here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2570" target="_blank">00:42:50.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, there's a lot there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2571" target="_blank">00:42:51.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So just a couple things I think that are worth your viewers knowing, because Scott's right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2576" target="_blank">00:42:56.220</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, the nuclear physics is complicated, and it's also important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2580" target="_blank">00:43:00.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So the Iranians have assembled about, they say, about 15 to 17 bombs worth of 60% enriched uranium.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2587" target="_blank">00:43:07.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think it's always important for your listeners to understand, what does this all mean?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2591" target="_blank">00:43:11.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Enriched to 3.67% to 20% to 60% and then to 90% weapons-grade uranium.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2598" target="_blank">00:43:18.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, what does this actual process mean?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2599" target="_blank">00:43:19.980</a></span> | <span class="t">First of all, obviously, enriched uranium is a key capability to develop a nuclear weapon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2604" target="_blank">00:43:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It can also be used for other purposes, civilian purposes and research purposes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2609" target="_blank">00:43:29.820</a></span> | <span class="t">You can use it to power a nuclear submarine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2612" target="_blank">00:43:32.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's just, if you don't mind, if I could just break it down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2615" target="_blank">00:43:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">That's fascinating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2615" target="_blank">00:43:35.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2615" target="_blank">00:43:35.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2616" target="_blank">00:43:36.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Just, I think it's, again, important just to understand the sort of basics before we jump</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2620" target="_blank">00:43:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">into the allegations and claims and counterclaims.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2623" target="_blank">00:43:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're going to enrich to 3.67% enriched uranium, that's for civilian nuclear power, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2631" target="_blank">00:43:51.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But when you do that, you've basically 70% of what you need to get to weapons-grade, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2635" target="_blank">00:43:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So you've done all the steps, 70% of the steps, in order to get to weapons-grade uranium.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2641" target="_blank">00:44:01.340</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're enriched to 20%, you are now at 90% of what you need to get to weapons-grade uranium.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2649" target="_blank">00:44:09.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, why would you need 20%?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2650" target="_blank">00:44:10.440</a></span> | <span class="t">You may need it for something like a research reactor, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2654" target="_blank">00:44:14.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Medical isotopes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2655" target="_blank">00:44:15.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Iran has, correct.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2656" target="_blank">00:44:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Iran has a Tehran research reactor for medical isotopes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2660" target="_blank">00:44:20.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, you can, by the way, you can buy those isotopes from abroad or you can produce them at home.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2666" target="_blank">00:44:26.260</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're going to enrich to 60%, right, then you've done 99% of what you need to get to weapons-grade uranium.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2673" target="_blank">00:44:33.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And then 90% is, quote, weapons-grade uranium.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2676" target="_blank">00:44:36.600</a></span> | <span class="t">By the way, you can use 60% to actually deliver a crude nuclear device.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2680" target="_blank">00:44:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">That has been done in the past.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2682" target="_blank">00:44:42.980</a></span> | <span class="t">But you want to get to, quote, 90%, that's weapons-grade uranium as Scott's defining it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2689" target="_blank">00:44:49.500</a></span> | <span class="t">But just, again, to clarify, these huge stockpiles of 60% that Iran has accumulated, right, this 60%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2696" target="_blank">00:44:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">16, 17% bombs worth of 60% is 99% of what they need for weapons-grade.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2701" target="_blank">00:45:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So I just wanted to explain that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2703" target="_blank">00:45:03.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, but when you're saying, if you include the mining, the refining of the ore into yellow cake,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2708" target="_blank">00:45:08.980</a></span> | <span class="t">the transformation of that into uranium hexafluoride gas, the driving of it in a truck over to the centrifuge</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2715" target="_blank">00:45:15.980</a></span> | <span class="t">and then spinning it, this is where we get this 90% number from, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2721" target="_blank">00:45:21.020</a></span> | <span class="t">In place of 90% enriched uranium or 80% enriched uranium, it's 90% of the way on some chart that includes picking up a shovel and beginning to mine, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2733" target="_blank">00:45:33.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So, again, just to clarify, I just think it's important to understand the definition of terms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2737" target="_blank">00:45:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Once you have 60% enriched uranium, you've done 99% of all the steps, including some of the steps that Scott's talking about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2745" target="_blank">00:45:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You've done 99% of what you need to have weapons-grade uranium.</span></div><div

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2750" target="_blank">00:45:50.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, as I've already established numerous times here, under the JCPOA, they shipped out every bit of their enriched uranium stockpile.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2758" target="_blank">00:45:58.300</a></span> | <span class="t">The French turned it into fuel rods and then shipped it back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2761" target="_blank">00:46:01.660</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the deal they're trying to get the U.S. back into and were obviously clearly willing to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2767" target="_blank">00:46:07.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And, again, the only reason they were enriching up to 60% was to put the pressure on the Americans to go ahead and get back into the deal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2773" target="_blank">00:46:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And, bad bet, it gave them an excuse to bomb based on the idea that people are going to listen to him,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2778" target="_blank">00:46:18.740</a></span> | <span class="t">pretend that somehow that's 99% of the way to the bomb, when you're including, yeah, driving to the mine and mining it and converting it to yellow cake and all these other things.</span></div><div class="c"><span

need the weapons-grade uranium.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2791" target="_blank">00:46:31.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And just to repeat, they have multiple bombs' worth of the 60% enriched uranium, which, again, is 99% of the steps you need to take for weapons-grade.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2801" target="_blank">00:46:41.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So they're very close to weapons-grade.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2803" target="_blank">00:46:43.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It's 1% more that they need to do to enrich to weapons-grade.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2807" target="_blank">00:46:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">The second aspect of a deliverable nuclear weapon is obviously the delivery vehicle, and those are the missiles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2813" target="_blank">00:46:53.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And according to the DNI and other incredible sources, Iran has got the largest missile inventory in the Middle East,</span></div><div

ballistic missiles, 2,000 capable of reaching Israel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2830" target="_blank">00:47:10.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's no doubt that Iran has the ability, once they have the weapons-grade uranium and the warhead,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2836" target="_blank">00:47:16.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to affix that to a missile and deliver that, certainly to hit Israel, hit our Gulf neighbors, hit Southern Europe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2843" target="_blank">00:47:23.220</a></span> | <span class="t">They also have an active intercontinental ballistic missile program, an ICBM program, which ultimately is designed not to hit the Israelis or the Gulfies,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2853" target="_blank">00:47:33.700</a></span> | <span class="t">but to hit deeper into Europe and ultimately to target the United

missile program.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2860" target="_blank">00:47:40.820</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's an important part of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2862" target="_blank">00:47:42.060</a></span> | <span class="t">The third leg of the stool, and Scott has already alluded to this, and we've had some debate on this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2866" target="_blank">00:47:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and I think we should talk about it, what it really means in detail, is you've got to develop a warhead or a crude nuclear device.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2873" target="_blank">00:47:53.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And according to estimates from both U.S. government sources and nuclear experts,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2880" target="_blank">00:48:00.260</a></span> | <span class="t">it would take about four to six months for Iran to develop a crude nuclear device.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2884" target="_blank">00:48:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">This is something that you wouldn't use a missile to deliver, but you would use a plane or a ship.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2890" target="_blank">00:48:10.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And it would take somewhere in the neighborhood of about a year and a half to deliver or to develop a warhead,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2896" target="_blank">00:48:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and that's to affix to the missile.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2898" target="_blank">00:48:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's sort of the three legs of the nuclear stool, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2900" target="_blank">00:48:20.740</a></span> | <span class="t">The weapons-grade uranium, the missiles to deliver it, and the warhead.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2908" target="_blank">00:48:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So I just want to sort of define terms so that when we're having this big debate, your listeners kind of understand what we're talking about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2915" target="_blank">00:48:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If I can jump in here on this point, too, and I'll turn it back over to you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2917" target="_blank">00:48:37.340</a></span> | <span class="t">but I actually have a bit of a

detail.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2960" target="_blank">00:49:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">The easiest kind of nuke to make out of uranium is a simple gun-type nuke, like they dropped on Hiroshima.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=2965"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=4374" target="_blank">01:12:54.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And they will expand their power through the Middle East.</span></div><div

until October 7th, this axis of resistance, as he calls it, which are these terror proxy armies, Hezbollah, Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the Iraqi Shiite militias, the Houthis in Yemen, and certainly supporting the Assad regime in Syria.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=4395" target="_blank">01:13:15.140</a></span> | <span class="t">He built a very, very impressive and deadly axis that he turned against the United States and against Israel, which saw its culmination on October 7th.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=4404" target="_blank">01:13:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I think after October 7th, that was a huge miscalculation for Khamenei, and we've seen the results of what's happened to his axis of resistance through quite devastating Israeli military capabilities over the past number of months.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=4418" target="_blank">01:13:38.020</a></span> | <span class="t">But he has an ideology, and I think where I agree with Scott is I'm not sure if Khamenei would actually use a nuclear weapon against Israel, the United States, because I don't think Khamenei is suicidal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=4429" target="_blank">01:13:49.820</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think what Khamenei wants is he wants a nuclear weapon as a backstop for his conventional power.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=4436" target="_blank">01:13:56.640</a></span> | <span class="t">It's very much the Kim Jong-un model of North Korea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=4441" target="_blank">01:14:01.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to have nuclear weapons with ICBMs to threaten America, but what I'm actually going to do is threaten South Korea with having massive conventional capabilities on the DMZ that I could take South Korea in a week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=4451" target="_blank">01:14:11.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I could destroy in a

South Korea, have no military option.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=4455" target="_blank">01:14:15.780</a></span> | <span

can actually, building up this massive ballistic missile arsenal that he's unleashed in the past 12 days, that according to, again, the U.S. and Israel, was going to go from 2,000 to 6,000 to 20,000.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=4470" target="_blank">01:14:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And from Khamenei's perspective, he didn't need to drop a nuclear bomb on Tel Aviv.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=4475" target="_blank">01:14:35.400</a></span> | <span class="t">What he needed to do was use the threat of nuclear escalation in order to use his conventional capabilities, his missiles, to destroy Tel Aviv.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=4483" target="_blank">01:14:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And you've already seen the damage from just a few dozen ballistic missiles getting through, the kind of damage that he's wrought on Tel Aviv already.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=4491" target="_blank">01:14:51.880</a></span> | <span class="t">That is the conception that Khamenei has.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=4494" target="_blank">01:14:54.220</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a revolutionary regime.</span></div><div class="c"><span

it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=4499" target="_blank">01:14:59.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Actually, that's a good

break.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=4502" target="_blank">01:15:02.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, we took a quick break, and now, Scott.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=4507" target="_blank">01:15:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, okay, so a few things there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=4509" target="_blank">01:15:09.540</a></span> | <span class="t">First of all, on Ahmad, the pre-2003 nuclear weapons research, the CIA estimate in 2007 concluded that all research had stopped in 2003.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=4522" target="_blank">01:15:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, in Gareth Porter's book, Manufactured Crisis, he shows that the major conclusion that the DIA had made, that the Iranians were researching nuclear weapons, was based on some invoices that they had intercepted for some dual-use materials, some specialty magnets and things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=4548" target="_blank">01:15:48.700</a></span> | <span class="t">That they thought, boy, this looks like this could be part of a weaponization program, a secret program here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=4555" target="_blank">01:15:55.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, Gareth Porter, who's a really great critic of all of these policies and claims, says, hey, this was a good-faith misunderstanding by DIA.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=4563" target="_blank">01:16:03.560</a></span> | <span class="t">They were doing their job.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=4564" target="_blank">01:16:04.740</a></span> | <span class="t">But it turned out, the IAEA later, when America gave them that information, the IAEA went and verified, oh, there's the magnet, and there's this, and there's that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=4572" target="_blank">01:16:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And all those dual-use items actually were being used for civilian purposes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=4575" target="_blank">01:16:15.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And so then, as Gareth writes in his book, the only real reason that the NIE said that they even had a program before 2003 was essentially because they didn't want to dispute their last mistaken conclusion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=4589" target="_blank">01:16:29.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So they said, okay, well, that was right up until then, but that was when that changed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=4592" target="_blank">01:16:32.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the other half of their reason for accepting that there ever was a nuclear weapons research program in the country before 2003 was the smoking laptop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=4602" target="_blank">01:16:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm sorry, I think I misspoke earlier when I said that the laptop was in 2005.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=4607" target="_blank">01:16:47.520</a></span> | <span class="t">That was just the Washington Post story that had a bunch of stuff about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=4610" target="_blank">01:16:50.500</a></span> | <span class="t">That was in 2003 as well, or 2004, possibly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=4613" target="_blank">01:16:53.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So this was why the—but it was still all, again, forged by the Israelis and funneled through the MEK cult, but was obsolete, essentially, and had nothing in it, at least the accusations, and it weren't past 2003.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=4629" target="_blank">01:17:09.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there's really no reason to believe that there was actually a nuclear weapons research program even before 2003, which then, again, the National Intelligence Council says ended in 2003 and hasn't been restarted since then.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=4643" target="_blank">01:17:23.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Can I ask you a question?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=4643" target="_blank">01:17:23.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Just not a comment by me, but a question, just your perspective.</span></div><div

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=4647" target="_blank">01:17:27.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So the nuclear archive, this massive archive that the Israelis were able to take out of Tehran, bring to the United States, bring to the IAEA, which is very detailed blueprints.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=4659" target="_blank">01:17:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just the alleged studies documents again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=4661" target="_blank">01:17:41.560</a></span> | <span class="t">It's the same stuff from the smoking laptop.</span></div><div

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=4663" target="_blank">01:17:43.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So let me just ask you, because it's huge and it's very detailed, and it shows clearly that Iran had an active nuclear weapons program, certainly until 2003, and then we can have a discussion about what happened after that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

I'm talking about is 100 days, the Iranian sea, that the U.S. military has taken down the Iraqi army, that they had fought an eight-year war with, where almost a million people, Scott, as you know, had been killed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=5154" target="_blank">01:25:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So they were afraid

target="_blank">01:26:00.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So they make a decision to end their active Ahmaud program.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=5166" target="_blank">01:26:06.440</a></span> | <span class="t">They make a decision to build up the key capabilities they need to retain an Iranian nuclear weapons option, specifically the enrichment capabilities at Natanz and then Fordow and at Iraq, giving them the plutonium route.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=5183" target="_blank">01:26:23.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And then what they do is they take the members of the Ahmaud program, the nuclear

who you mentioned earlier, who's in some respects, I wouldn't call him the Oppenheimer of the Iranian nuclear weapons program.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=5208" target="_blank">01:26:48.740</a></span> | <span class="t">He's more like, who was in the Oppenheimer movie, Leslie Grove, the guy who was actually responsible for the organization and the training and the recruitment, and the guy that actually ran the program as opposed to Oppenheimer, the sort of brilliant nuclear physicist.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=5224" target="_blank">01:27:04.260</a></span> | <span class="t">This is

control of this program, and now it is dispersed, and it is unstructured in that sense, because they recognize that if they continue with this, the United States may march to Tehran.</span></div><div

capabilities, the enrichment capabilities, to give them an option for a nuclear weapon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=5248" target="_blank">01:27:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But we, the NIE, have decided, or we have concluded, that they no longer have an active, structured nuclear weapons program.</span></div><div

a nuclear warhead, we've had that discussion so far.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=5277" target="_blank">01:27:57.440</a></span> |

we go, because there's so much history, we're going to lose ourselves and there's not enough hours.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=6692" target="_blank">01:51:32.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So is there is there such a scenario?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=6695" target="_blank">01:51:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I think one must never rule it out because there is a scenario, for example, where the regime collapses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=6703" target="_blank">01:51:43.220</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">01:51:46.700</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not suggesting that will happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=6708" target="_blank">01:51:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">There are a whole bunch of scenarios maybe we should talk about with respect to the collapse of the regime.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=6714" target="_blank">01:51:54.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But you could see a scenario where the United States would have to go in there in order to try to secure military and nuclear and missile assets so that it doesn't end up the hands of warring factional and ethnic groups that Scott referred to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=6730" target="_blank">01:52:10.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Because, again, as he's rightly pointed out, Iran is not Persia.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=6734" target="_blank">01:52:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Can't the IDF handle it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=6735" target="_blank">01:52:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So can I just finish?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=6737" target="_blank">01:52:17.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Just who can handle it, who cannot handle it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=6739" target="_blank">01:52:19.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that it's a potential scenario, which is why I don't think anybody should be advocating for a U.S. decapitation of the regime in Iran.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=6749" target="_blank">01:52:29.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I have long been on record as supporting the Iranian people, providing support to the Iranian people to, at one point, take back their country and take back their flag.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=6758" target="_blank">01:52:38.780</a></span> | <span class="t">It's very much sort of Reagan's strategy that Reagan ran in the Cold War of maximum pressure on the regime, maximum support for anti-Soviet dissidents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=6766" target="_blank">01:52:46.780</a></span> | <span class="t">While, by the way, he was negotiating arms control agreements for the Soviet Union in order to try to reduce the number of nuclear-tipped ICBMs that both countries had pointed at each other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=6775" target="_blank">01:52:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think the Reagan strategy of providing support to the people is a far better strategy for trying to get transition, leadership transition, government transition inside Iran.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=6786" target="_blank">01:53:06.440</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think the scenario of decapitation strikes, killing Khamenei, taking out the entire government, could potentially lead to that scenario.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=6793" target="_blank">01:53:13.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think we have to be conscious of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=6795" target="_blank">01:53:15.740</a></span> | <span class="t">We have to guard against that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=6797" target="_blank">01:53:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think that's important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=6798" target="_blank">01:53:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I think Scott's right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=6799" target="_blank">01:53:19.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, if a scenario happened like that, yeah, I mean, I think the Israelis have demonstrated extraordinary capabilities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=6805" target="_blank">01:53:25.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And they could go in there and they could secure loose nuclear materials that you would be worried could be fashioned for nuclear weapons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=6814" target="_blank">01:53:34.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, Scott doesn't seem to worry about these materials.</span></div><div

hands of anybody because they're all capabilities that just the physics of it, you can produce nuclear weapons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=6824" target="_blank">01:53:44.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So best case scenario, negotiation, we fully dismantle their program in Amman.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=6829" target="_blank">01:53:49.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Worst case scenario is having to return for continued military strikes that continue to escalate the situation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=6838" target="_blank">01:53:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Worst, worst situation is some kind of decapitation strike that collapses the regime and causes chaos.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=6845" target="_blank">01:54:05.320</a></span> | <span class="t">There are a whole bunch of other scenarios we can talk about that are embedded in that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=6848" target="_blank">01:54:08.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think if you're a responsible person and a responsible analyst, and certainly if you're a responsible policymaker, you've got to be planning for all of these scenarios and more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=6856" target="_blank">01:54:16.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Scott, what do you think is the best case and the worst case here?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=6859" target="_blank">01:54:19.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, the best case scenario is that we quit right now and that Trump figures out a way to reorder some paragraphs and get back in something like the JCPOA, which was also signed with the rest of the UN Security Council power.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=6874" target="_blank">01:54:34.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Can I ask you, like, is JCPOA a pretty good approximation of what would be a good deal?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=6878" target="_blank">01:54:38.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Pretty good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=6879" target="_blank">01:54:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">It could have been better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=6880" target="_blank">01:54:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">As I said at the beginning, Trump could have gone in there and tried to negotiate a better result with the sunset provisions on some of those things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=6887" target="_blank">01:54:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">But the concept that America is just going to insist on zero enrichment, zero nuclear program whatsoever, when they have the unalienable right, quote unquote, in the non-fliferation treaty to civilian nuclear material and a civilian program, it's a poison pill.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=6904" target="_blank">01:55:04.740</a></span> | <span class="t">It's meant to fail, just like it was a poison pill meant to destroy the talks here, good enough to start a war.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=6910" target="_blank">01:55:10.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, as I quoted from earlier, he said on TV last week, well, America has to take out Fordow now because now they're more likely to break out towards a nuke.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=6922" target="_blank">01:55:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that's exactly right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=6924" target="_blank">01:55:24.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So there still is, or there's strong reason to be skeptical, including Israeli and American officials told the New York Times that they thought that the damage was quite incomplete.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=6934" target="_blank">01:55:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, the IAA just came out recently, just point of fact, sort of interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=6937" target="_blank">01:55:37.740</a></span> | <span class="t">We'll see on the battle damage assessment, but they actually think the facility was destroyed and that the centrifuges, the sensitive centrifuges were destroyed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=6945" target="_blank">01:55:45.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So just interesting for the viewers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=6947" target="_blank">01:55:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And it may be premature.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=6949" target="_blank">01:55:49.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Now we're going to have to bomb all the uranium mines and all the aluminum smelters so that they can't make any more centrifuges.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=6955" target="_blank">01:55:55.760</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">01:56:04.260</a></span> | <span class="t">They make matters worse and create more work for themselves and make things worse and worse and worse.</span></div><div class="c"><span

target="_blank">01:56:15.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Now America's in the situation where the danger that Iran will now break out to a nuke is so heightened that now we're talking about, well, maybe we'll have to do a full regime change.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=6985" target="_blank">01:56:25.280</a></span> | <span

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=8194" target="_blank">02:16:34.540</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that he really could have.</span></div><div

but I believe, Mark, when he says that the Europeans were being intransigent on that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=8202" target="_blank">02:16:42.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, I criticize the CIA and FBI for framing Trump for treason, for preventing him from being able to work with the Russians to see if maybe they could put pressure on the Ayatollah to deal with him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=8211" target="_blank">02:16:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think that it's clear when the Ayatollah was willing in the JCPOA to, well, first of all, to sign the additional protocol back in the W. Bush years for a year for three years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=8220" target="_blank">02:17:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">He didn't enrich anything under that deal as long as he was negotiating with the E3 and then under the JCPOA, where he's shipping out every bit of his declared nuclear material.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=8229" target="_blank">02:17:09.420</a></span> | <span class="t">He's clearly keeping the ability to enrich if necessary to weapons grade if if a crisis breaks out and he feels like he has to make nukes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=8239" target="_blank">02:17:19.860</a></span> | <span class="t">But he has he had no stockpile to enrich this whole thing about ninety nine percent of the way there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=8245" target="_blank">02:17:25.220</a></span> | <span class="t">He had no stockpile. So even if you, you know, count gassing up your truck on the way to the mine as part of this long time scale of percentages here, they were much further from a nuke under the deal, which he agrees we shouldn't have even gotten out of.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=8259" target="_blank">02:17:39.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Can I just say technically, just I think, again, important for your listeners to understand under the JCPOA, Iran is allowed to keep a stockpile of maximum of 300 kilograms, as I remember, of three point six seven percent in rich material.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=8274" target="_blank">02:17:54.000</a></span> | <span

to enrich.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=8288" target="_blank">02:18:08.120</a></span> | <span class="t">They did keep a

years to go under three point six seven percent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=8296" target="_blank">02:18:16.240</a></span> | <span

this goes to the larger argument about the apocalyptic threat of the ITOL, which Mark has not made, but which Israel hawks often do, that these guys just can't wait to get into a war and all this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=8373" target="_blank">02:19:33.800</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, if you look at

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=9857" target="_blank">02:44:17.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what you would see, I hope it doesn't happen, but I worry about, is this kind of proliferation cascade in the Middle East and in the Indo-Pacific, two of the most important areas for American national security.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=9869" target="_blank">02:44:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Which is why I think it's very important that Iran's be stopped.</span></div><div

nuclear weapon or accelerates it, we disagree, but I think neither of us know yet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=9883"

so,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=9893" target="_blank">02:44:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">you're going to see five, six

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=9916" target="_blank">02:45:16.900</a></span> | <span class="t">I think if they see what has happened and that it's successful and it stopped Iran from developing nuclear weapons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=9923" target="_blank">02:45:23.960</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=9931" target="_blank">02:45:31.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Then the message to all these other countries is, number one, you don't need it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=9934" target="_blank">02:45:34.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And number two, if you try to get

them are our allies, but I think the United States retains many tools, counterproliferation tools to prevent these countries from developing nuclear weapons, including, you know, sanctions and export controls and many of the things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=9959" target="_blank">02:45:59.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And plus, I think those countries, you know, understand that in the Middle East, despite Scott's focus on Israel, you know, when you talk to Arab leaders, their biggest concern is the threat from Iran.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=9973" target="_blank">02:46:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not the threat from

why the UAE and Bahrain and Morocco entered into this peace agreement with Israel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=9983" target="_blank">02:46:23.740</a></span> | <span class="t">The Saudis will one day, and they'll bring many other Arab and Muslim countries in it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=9988" target="_blank">02:46:28.020</a></span> | <span class="t">They don't say Israel is a threat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=9989" target="_blank">02:46:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">They see Iran as a threat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=9990" target="_blank">02:46:30.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And so if you counter that threat, you eliminate Iran's nuclear weapons proliferation and expansion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=9998" target="_blank">02:46:38.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Those countries now no longer have to build nuclear weapons capabilities to counter the Iranians.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10004" target="_blank">02:46:44.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, we've also restored our credibility.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10006" target="_blank">02:46:46.360</a></span> | <span class="t">We don't bluff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10008" target="_blank">02:46:48.140</a></span> | <span class="t">We said Iran doesn't develop nuclear weapons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10011" target="_blank">02:46:51.160</a></span> | <span class="t">They won't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10012" target="_blank">02:46:52.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And now it's the Japanese who have, as Scott rightly pointed out, they do have reprocessing and plutonium capabilities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10020" target="_blank">02:47:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">The Taiwanese, who used to have a military nuclear weapons program and gave it up, and the South Koreans, who agree to our gold standard of zero enrichment, zero reprocessing, those three countries can now say, okay, we rely on the United States, on your word, on your power, and on your ability to actually turn words into action.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10040" target="_blank">02:47:20.980</a></span> | <span class="t">We don't need nuclear weapons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10042" target="_blank">02:47:22.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So I say, if successful, big F, big F, if successful, then it's going to be a significant guard against the potential of greater nuclear proliferation, and we will have less nuclear powers, nuclear weapons powers, than we otherwise would have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10062" target="_blank">02:47:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">My favorite thing is when you guys point out when you agree with the other person.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10066" target="_blank">02:47:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Anyway, Scott, what do you think?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10068" target="_blank">02:47:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What do you think everything that's just happened over the past two weeks does to nuclear proliferation over the next 5, 10, 20 years?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10075" target="_blank">02:47:55.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, I mean, I really don't know for sure, but I would think that there's a very great danger that it's going to reinforce the lessons of North Korea, Iraq, and Libya, which is you better get a nuke to keep America out, and you better hurry before it's too late.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10092" target="_blank">02:48:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, for the Saudis, they're not going to do that, because they're obviously a very close American client state, so it's a different dynamic there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10099" target="_blank">02:48:19.300</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, for any country that has trouble with the United States or is worried about the future of their ability to maintain their national sovereignty, obviously getting their hands on an A-bomb as quickly as possible has been, you know, re-incentivized to a great degree.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10114" target="_blank">02:48:34.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Also, I'm really worried about the future of the non-proliferation treaty, where the nuclear weapons states promise to respect the right of non-nuclear weapons states to civilian nuclear energy, and where here you have a non-NPT signatory nuclear weapons state, Israel, launch an aggressive war against an NPT signatory that was not attacking them and was not making nuclear weapons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10140" target="_blank">02:49:00.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And with the assistance of the United States, another nuclear weapons state signatory to the NPT, and I don't really take this that seriously, but it's worth at least listening to is Miedvedev, the once and probably future president of Russia.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10158" target="_blank">02:49:18.520</a></span> | <span class="t">He said, oh, yeah, well, maybe we'll just give them a nuke or kind of implied maybe get Pakistan to now for people familiar with like he and Peel, Miedvedev is sort of angry Obama, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10169" target="_blank">02:49:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">For Putin, you know, that skit where it's like Obama talks all calm and go translator.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10173" target="_blank">02:49:33.940</a></span> | <span class="t">He'll goes off like an angry black guy kind of character.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10176" target="_blank">02:49:36.980</a></span> | <span class="t">He's been going nuts on Twitter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10178" target="_blank">02:49:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Miedvedev, he goes way out, you know, above and beyond.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10182" target="_blank">02:49:42.220</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think he's probably acting on instructions to talk that way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10184" target="_blank">02:49:44.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And it is a real risk that the NPT could just fall apart when it becomes, when it's treated so callously by the United States who invented it and insisted that the rest of the world adopt the thing to such a great degree.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10199" target="_blank">02:49:59.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Trump did say, don't use the N-word.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10200" target="_blank">02:50:00.920</a></span> | <span class="t">He talked down to Miedvedev.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10202" target="_blank">02:50:02.440</a></span> | <span class="t">That's right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10202" target="_blank">02:50:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, he did.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10203" target="_blank">02:50:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Don't throw around the N, the nuclear word.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10205" target="_blank">02:50:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, well, and I appreciate that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10207" target="_blank">02:50:07.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10207" target="_blank">02:50:07.960</a></span> | <span class="t">He's right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10208" target="_blank">02:50:08.840</a></span> | <span class="t">He's right in that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10209" target="_blank">02:50:09.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And look, the Pakistanis could give a nuke to Iran, who are their friends, I think, not the tightest of allies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10216" target="_blank">02:50:16.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not saying I predict that, but there's a danger of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10219" target="_blank">02:50:19.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, when it comes to, you know, Eastern Asia, obviously there's a concern about a Chinese threat to Taiwan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10227" target="_blank">02:50:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">But nobody thinks China's coming for South Korea or Japan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10231" target="_blank">02:50:31.960</a></span> | <span class="t">The question of Taiwan is one that's very different because, as the American president agreed with Mao Zedong 50 years ago, Taiwan is part of China and eventually will be reunited, although we hope that's not by force.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10245" target="_blank">02:50:45.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Since then, they have essentially abandoned Marxism, although it's still a one-party authoritarian state, but they've essentially abandoned Marxism, adopted markets, at least to the degree that they've been able to afford to now build up a giant naval force that is capable of retaking Taiwan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10262" target="_blank">02:51:02.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I think the way to prevent that is not for making a bunch of threats and setting examples in other places about how tough we are, but to negotiate with the Chinese and the Taiwanese and figure out a way to reunite the two in a peaceful way in order to prevent that war from breaking out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10279" target="_blank">02:51:19.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Because, in fact, we don't really have the naval and air capability to defend Taiwan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10284" target="_blank">02:51:24.340</a></span> | <span class="t">We could lose a lot of guys trying and probably kill a lot of Chinese trying, but in the end, they'd probably take Taiwan anyway.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10291" target="_blank">02:51:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And we'd have lost a bunch of ships and planes for nothing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10295" target="_blank">02:51:35.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So we can negotiate an end to that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10297" target="_blank">02:51:37.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And then even if America just withdrew from the region, we could still negotiate long-term agreements between China, Japan, South Korea, and whoever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10306" target="_blank">02:51:46.260</a></span> | <span class="t">There's no reason to think that everyone would make a mad scramble to a bomb to protect them the moment they are out from under America's nuclear umbrella and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10318" target="_blank">02:51:58.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And the fact of the matter is that, you know, the greatest threat to the status quo as far as the nuclear powers go probably is what just happened.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10327" target="_blank">02:52:07.940</a></span> | <span class="t">America and Israel launching this war against a non-nuclear weapon state as a member in good standing of this treaty throws the whole, as they

target="_blank">02:52:21.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, if these rules repeatedly always apply to everyone else, but very often not to us, then are they really the law or this is just the

how long do we expect the rest of the world to go ahead and abide by that if, you know, a deal is a deal until we decide, as Bill Clinton said, to wake up one morning and decide that we don't like it anymore and change it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10365" target="_blank">02:52:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">That was a

credibility of that military force has to be maintained in order to ensure that he does not break out or sneak out to a nuclear weapon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10802" target="_blank">03:00:02.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that's absolutely critical.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

some kind of accommodation between the Israelis and the Palestinians.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10841" target="_blank">03:00:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">We can go down many rabbit holes on that, but I think that lays the predicate for a Saudi-Israeli normalization deal that then brings in multiple Arab countries and Muslim countries.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10853" target="_blank">03:00:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And finally, we talked about the Abraham Accords.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10858" target="_blank">03:00:58.220</a></span> | <span class="t">I think we need to start thinking about what did the Cyrus Accords look like, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10861" target="_blank">03:01:01.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Cyrus was the great Persian king, right, who, by the way, brought the Jews back from the diaspora to Jerusalem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10870" target="_blank">03:01:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And Cyrus Accords would be, let's find an agreement between the United States and Israel and Iran.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10876" target="_blank">03:01:16.900</a></span> | <span class="t">That would be a remarkable transformation in the region if we could actually do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10881" target="_blank">03:01:21.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So imagine the Middle East.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10882" target="_blank">03:01:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, I know this sounds fanciful, but I think this is what Trump has in mind when he starts to talk about the things you're seeing in these truth posts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10889" target="_blank">03:01:29.380</a></span> | <span class="t">It's actually a Middle East that can be fundamentally transformed, where we actually do bring peace between Israel, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the rest of these countries.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10899" target="_blank">03:01:39.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I, by the way, completely agree with you on Syria.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10902" target="_blank">03:01:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">The idea that we are trusting a former al-Qaeda ISIS jihadist to rule Syria, I think, is a big bet President Trump has made.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10913" target="_blank">03:01:53.420</a></span> | <span class="t">He's made it on the advice of MBS.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10915" target="_blank">03:01:55.240</a></span> | <span class="t">We'll see how that transforms or transpires and see if Syria is transformed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10921" target="_blank">03:02:01.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But the notion that somehow we should just be rolling the dice, lifting all the sanctions, and taking this former al-Qaeda jihadist at his word is a big bet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10932" target="_blank">03:02:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">If we get the bet right, that is actually a remarkable occurrence, because now all of a sudden Syria and Lebanon are brought into this Abraham Accords, Cyrus Accords structure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10943" target="_blank">03:02:23.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we actually have what I think all three of us want, is peace in the Middle East, stability in the Middle East.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10949" target="_blank">03:02:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think we need democracy in the Middle East.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10951" target="_blank">03:02:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I think if the Middle East looked like the UAE, that'd be a pretty good Middle East.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10955" target="_blank">03:02:35.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I think we'd all be pretty comfortable with that, if that kind of stability and prosperity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10959" target="_blank">03:02:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And ultimately, you could put these countries on a pathway to greater democracy, the way that we did during the Cold War, where countries like Taiwan and South Korea that were military dictatorships end up becoming pro-Western democracy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10972" target="_blank">03:02:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's kind of stepping back, maybe a little bit Pollyannish, but I think we should also always keep in mind what a potential vision for peace could look like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10981" target="_blank">03:03:01.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So, Scott, as many people know, here in Austin, Texas, you're the director of the Libertarian Institute.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10988" target="_blank">03:03:08.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's zoom out a bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10991" target="_blank">03:03:11.260</a></span> | <span class="t">What are the key pillars of libertarianism and how that informs how you see the world?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=10997" target="_blank">03:03:17.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, the very basis of libertarianism is the non-aggression principle, which essentially is the same thing as our social rules for dealing with each other in private life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=11008" target="_blank">03:03:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">No force, no theft, no fraud.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=11011" target="_blank">03:03:31.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And keep your hands to yourself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=11013" target="_blank">03:03:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And we apply that same moral law to government.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=11016" target="_blank">03:03:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, some libertarians are anarcho-capitalists.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=11019" target="_blank">03:03:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Some are so-called minarchists, meaning we want the absolute minimum amount of government, a night watchman type state.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=11026" target="_blank">03:03:46.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And in other words, just enough to enforce contracts and protect property rights and allow freedom and a free market to work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=11035" target="_blank">03:03:55.220</a></span> | <span class="t">There's also, of course, natural rights theory, Austrian school economics, and a lot of revisionist history.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=11040" target="_blank">03:04:00.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And something very key to libertarian theory is expressed by Marianne Rothbard, was that war is the key to the whole libertarian business.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=11054" target="_blank">03:04:14.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Because, especially in the United States of America, as long as we maintain a world empire, makes it impossible for us to have a limited and decentralized government here at home, as our constitution describes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=11064" target="_blank">03:04:24.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, I was going to crack a joke, but neither of you have called me an isolationist yet, but I was going to joke.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=11069" target="_blank">03:04:29.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, as Thomas Jefferson wrote in the Declaration of Isolation, the same guy, a principal author of the Declaration of Isolation, he said in his first inaugural address,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=11079"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=12735" target="_blank">03:32:15.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, it causes some difficulties.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=12737" target="_blank">03:32:17.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But anyway, I think the answer to that is that for Putin, he needs to understand that like Khamenei, he has two options here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=12748" target="_blank">03:32:28.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=12749" target="_blank">03:32:29.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Option one, which President Trump has signaled over and over and over again, is come sit down and negotiate a ceasefire with the Ukrainians.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=12757" target="_blank">03:32:37.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't want to get into the details and the back and forth about who's responsible for the fact there's no ceasefire, Putin or Zelensky.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=12763" target="_blank">03:32:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, that's a whole other debate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=12764" target="_blank">03:32:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm sure you guys have a lot of opinions on that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=12767" target="_blank">03:32:47.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But path one is sit down and let's negotiate a ceasefire.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=12771" target="_blank">03:32:51.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Path two is the United States will use American power in order to build our leverage so that Vladimir Putin understands that he has to do a ceasefire.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=12782" target="_blank">03:33:02.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I'm not suggesting U.S. troops.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=12784" target="_blank">03:33:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Absolutely not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=12785" target="_blank">03:33:05.380</a></span> | <span class="t">What I am suggesting is there's a package right now of sanctions that have 88 co-sponsors in the Senate across party lines.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=12792" target="_blank">03:33:12.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think Trump is using that and will use that as a sort of sword of Damocles hanging over Putin and the Russian economy to say, look, Vladimir, we either do a ceasefire or I'm going to have no choice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=12804" target="_blank">03:33:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But to have to start imposing much more punishing sanctions on you and on the Russian economy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=12810" target="_blank">03:33:30.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think there's an economic option.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=12812" target="_blank">03:33:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I think there's a military option.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=12813" target="_blank">03:33:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think the biggest mistake Biden made in this whole war, and there's many mistakes in terms of signaling, not having U.S. credibility, you know, Afghan debacle, which signaled to Putin that he could invade without any kind of American response.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=12828" target="_blank">03:33:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Is he kind of went in and he tied Ukraine's hands behind their back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=12833" target="_blank">03:33:53.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, he actually tied one hand behind their back while they were fighting with the other hand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=12836" target="_blank">03:33:56.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And he refused to give him the kinds of systems that early on in the war would have allowed the Ukrainian military to be able to hit Russian forces that were mobilizing on the Russian-Ukrainian border.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=12847" target="_blank">03:34:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think if he had done that, I think this war would have ended sooner.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=12851" target="_blank">03:34:11.240</a></span> | <span class="t">There'd be far less casualties.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=12853" target="_blank">03:34:13.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think Putin would then understand, maybe I need to strike a deal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=12859" target="_blank">03:34:19.500</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=12868" target="_blank">03:34:28.820</a></span> | <span class="t">That's for smarter people than me on this issue to decide what the deal looks like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=12872" target="_blank">03:34:32.580</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's no doubt today Putin thinks that he can just keep fighting, keep killing Ukrainians, keep driving forward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=12879" target="_blank">03:34:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Eventually he's going to wear down the Ukrainians through a sheer war of attrition.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=12882" target="_blank">03:34:42.700</a></span> | <span class="t">He'll throw hundreds of thousands of Russians at this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=12884" target="_blank">03:34:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">He doesn't care how many Russians are going to die.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=12886" target="_blank">03:34:46.360</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the way that Russians and the Soviets have fought wars for many, many years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=12890" target="_blank">03:34:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Just endless number of Russian bodies being thrown into the meat grinder.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=12894" target="_blank">03:34:54.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And he thinks he can continue without any consequences.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=12896" target="_blank">03:34:56.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And I worry that as a result of the fact that we are not showing Putin and we've got leverage, it's made war more likely, it's made a war more brutal, and it's going to make a war more protractive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=12909" target="_blank">03:35:09.300</a></span> | <span class="t">But increasing military aid to Ukraine, in the case that you described, also has to be coupled with extreme pressure to make peace.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=12916" target="_blank">03:35:16.740</a></span> | <span

Khamenei, is that because these isolationist voices were so prominent and so vocal, and in some cases quite persuasive to American leaders, Hitler calculated that the United States would not enter the war.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=13179" target="_blank">03:39:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so he could do what Scott

he believes all through the 30s and before Pearl Harbor, that the isolationist voices are keeping FDR from entering the war, even while Churchill and the Brits and the French and others are imploring the Americans,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=13212" target="_blank">03:40:12.300</a></span> | <span class="t">not only just to

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=13223" target="_blank">03:40:23.700</a></span> | <span class="t">In the same way, I think Khamenei miscalculates.</span></div><div class="c"><span

years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=13229" target="_blank">03:40:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">He believed that this sort of isolationist wing of the Republican Party, represented, I think, by Tucker Carlson and others who have been very anti-intervention with respect to Iran,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=13241" target="_blank">03:40:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I think he believed that that was the dominant voice within Trump's MAGA coalition, and that as a result, the United States would not use military force.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=13250" target="_blank">03:40:50.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So in the same way that Hitler miscalculated the influence of the isolationists on FDR, Khamenei misjudged the influence of the isolationists on Trump,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=13260" target="_blank">03:41:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and both ended up

weeks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=13274" target="_blank">03:41:14.740</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a real problem, too,

in this world, and we need to find the right balance between the overuse of military power and the underuse of military power.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=13652" target="_blank">03:47:32.680</a></span> | <span class="t">If we want to avoid wars, we have to have serious deterrence because our enemies need to understand we will use selective and narrowly focused overwhelming military power when we are facing threats like an Iranian nuclear weapon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=13666" target="_blank">03:47:46.040</a></span> | <span class="t">That is a serious threat to us, it's a serious threat to us, it's a serious threat to the region, it's a serious threat with respect to proliferation around the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=13673" target="_blank">03:47:53.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think with that respect, I think President Trump's decision to drop bombs on three key nuclear facilities was a selective, targeted military action that I hope will drive the Iranians back to the negotiating table where they can negotiate, finally, the dismantlement of their nuclear weapons program.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=13694" target="_blank">03:48:14.420</a></span> | <span class="t">I think there's a danger, again, again, we've had a four hour debate on this, so I'm sure if you want to rewind, you can listen to all our arguments once again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=13701" target="_blank">03:48:21.060</a></span> | <span class="t">But the fact of the matter is, is that the, our unwillingness to use power, if we're never going to use power, all that's going to do is send a signal to our enemies that they can do whatever they want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=13714" target="_blank">03:48:34.600</a></span> | <span class="t">They can violate whatever agreements they want, they can use aggression against anyone they want, and I think that makes, that puts American lives in danger.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=13723" target="_blank">03:48:43.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And we've seen the results of that, where we delayed and delayed and delayed, and we didn't move, and we didn't move too early, and we didn't preempt, and the threat grew, and we ignored the gathering storm.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=13733" target="_blank">03:48:53.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I think the lessons of, you know, a hundred years of American military involvement is, if you have an opportunity early on, as the storm is gathering, to use all instruments of American power, with the military one being the last one you use, then deter when you can, and strike when you must, in order to prevent the kinds of escalation and wars that everybody at this table, and I'm sure everybody listening in your audience is seeking to avoid.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtmJi8LbAts&t=13763" target="_blank">03:49:23.500</a></span> | <span class="t">On that topic, question for both of you, Scott, if human civilization destroys itself in the next 75 years, it probably most likely will be a World War III type of scenario, maybe a nuclear war.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
