solution to AI starts by having real, what I would call cognitive models</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=63">00:01:03.560</a></span> |

an approach that's dominant where you take statistical approximations</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=69">00:01:09.720</a></span> |

that there's a seal and the water will come</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=85">00:01:25.640</a></span> | <span

everyday phenomena is what we call</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=92">00:01:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">common

things start to fall into at least a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=98">00:01:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">bit better place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=99">00:01:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because right now you're learning correlations between pixels when you play a video game</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=102">00:01:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">or something like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=104">00:01:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And it doesn't work very well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=105">00:01:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">It works when the video game is just the way that you studied it, and then you alter the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=108">00:01:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">video game in small ways, like you move the paddle and break out a few pixels, and the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=112">00:01:52.440</a></span> | <span class="t">system falls apart.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=113">00:01:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Because it doesn't understand, it doesn't have a representation of a paddle, a ball,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=117">00:01:57.520</a></span>

So the idea of common sense, it's full of mystery.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=126">00:02:06.520</a></span> | <span class="t">You've worked on it, but it's nevertheless full of mystery, full of promise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=131">00:02:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">What does common sense mean?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=132">00:02:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">What does knowledge mean?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=134">00:02:14.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So the way you've been discussing it now is very intuitive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=136">00:02:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It makes a lot of sense that that is something we should have, and that's something deep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=140">00:02:20.040</a></span> | <span class="t">learning systems don't have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=142">00:02:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But the argument could be that we're oversimplifying it because, we're oversimplifying the notion</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=148">00:02:28.760</a></span> | <span class="t">of common sense because that's how we, it feels like we as humans at the cognitive level</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=154">00:02:34.280</a></span> | <span class="t">approach problems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=155">00:02:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">- So a lot of people aren't actually gonna read my book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=159">00:02:39.620</a></span> | <span class="t">But if they did read the book, one of the things that might come as a surprise to them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=163">00:02:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">is that we actually say common sense is really hard and really complicated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=167">00:02:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So they would probably, my critics know that I like common sense, but that chapter actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=173">00:02:53.640</a></span> | <span class="t">starts by us beating up, not on deep learning, but kind of on our own home team as it will.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=178">00:02:58.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So Ernie and I are first and foremost people that believe in at least some of what good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=183">00:03:03.400</a></span> | <span class="t">old fashioned AI tried to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=184">00:03:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So we believe in symbols and logic and programming, things like that are important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=190">00:03:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And we go through why even those tools that we hold fairly dear aren't really enough.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=195">00:03:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So we talk about why common sense is actually many things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=199">00:03:19.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And some of them fit really well with those classical sets of tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=202">00:03:22.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So things like taxonomy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=204">00:03:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So I know that a bottle is an object or it's a vessel, let's say, and I know a vessel is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=209">00:03:29.960</a></span> | <span class="t">an object and objects are material things in the physical world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=213">00:03:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So like I can make some inferences if I know that vessels need to not have holes in them,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=223">00:03:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">then I can infer that in order to carry their contents, then I can infer that a bottle shouldn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=227">00:03:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">have a hole in order to carry its contents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=229">00:03:49.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can do hierarchical inference and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=232">00:03:52.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And we say that's great, but it's only a tiny piece of what you need for common sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=237">00:03:57.400</a></span> | <span class="t">We give lots of examples that don't fit into that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=239">00:03:59.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So another one that we talk about is a cheese grater.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=242">00:04:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You've got holes in a cheese grater, you've got a handle on top.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=245">00:04:05.820</a></span> | <span class="t">You can build a model in the game engine sense of a model so that you could have a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=250">00:04:10.840</a></span> | <span class="t">cartoon character flying around through the holes of the grater.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=254">00:04:14.040</a></span> | <span class="t">But we don't have a system yet, taxonomy doesn't help us that much, that really understands</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=258">00:04:18.760</a></span> | <span class="t">why the handle is on top and what you do with the handle or why all of those circles are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=263">00:04:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">sharp or how you'd hold the cheese with respect to the grater in order to make it actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=267">00:04:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=268">00:04:28.840</a></span> | <span class="t">- So those ideas are just abstractions that could emerge on a system like a very large</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=274">00:04:34.920</a></span> | <span class="t">deep neural network?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=276">00:04:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">- I'm a skeptic that that kind of emergence per se can work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=279">00:04:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think that deep learning might play a role in the systems that do what I want systems</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=284">00:04:44.680</a></span> | <span class="t">to do, but it won't do it by itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=286">00:04:46.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I've never seen a deep learning system really extract an abstract concept.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=292">00:04:52.240</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=296">00:04:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">how the architectures are set up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=299">00:04:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">One example is deep learning people actually all build in something called convolution,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=305">00:05:05.880</a></span> | <span class="t">which Jan Lekun is famous for, which is an abstraction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=309">00:05:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">They don't have their systems learn

same if it appears in different places.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=315">00:05:15.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And what Lekun figured out and why, essentially why he was a co-winner of the Turing Award</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_IZNHH2S0&t=320">00:05:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">was that if you program this in innately, then your system would be a whole lot more</span></div><div
