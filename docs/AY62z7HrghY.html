We're going to have a look at three different traditional</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=5" target="_blank">00:00:05.580</a></span> | <span class="t">similarity search methods that we can use for comparing two separate chunks of text.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=15" target="_blank">00:00:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Those three methods, as you can see on the screen, we have Jacquard Similarity, WShingling</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=21" target="_blank">00:00:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and Levenshtein Distance. So let's jump straight into Jacquard. So Jacquard is actually super</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=33" target="_blank">00:00:33.180</a></span> | <span class="t">simple. All we have is the intersection between two sets. So we have A and B up here. These</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=38" target="_blank">00:00:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">can be something like this. So we'll just use numbers for now, 1, 2, 3. And let's say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=48" target="_blank">00:00:48.840</a></span> | <span class="t">this is our set A. And we want to have a look at the intersection between that and another</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=55" target="_blank">00:00:55.080</a></span> | <span class="t">set which is set B. And maybe this is just 2 and 4. So our intersection here are simply</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=64" target="_blank">00:01:04.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the shared items that both of these sets have. So we just have 1 here. So the intersection</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=70" target="_blank">00:01:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">would be 1. And then we also have the union up here. Now the union is still a set. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=76" target="_blank">00:01:16.780</a></span> | <span class="t">if we union all of these, we would get a total of 4 characters. Because we have 1, 2 and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=85" target="_blank">00:01:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">then we have 2 over here again. So that just creates 1 item. Then we have 3 and 4. So all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">together that's 4. We divide 1 by 4 and we get a Jacquard Similarity of 0.25. Now what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">does that look like in Python? Let's have a look. So this is our implementation in Python.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Now it's pretty simple. All we have is we simply take our two sentences, X and Y. We</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">convert them into sets. And then we calculate intersection and union between them. And Python</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=129" target="_blank">00:02:09.400</a></span> | <span class="t">has built in methods for both of those operations for sets which is pretty useful. So if we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.240</a></span> | <span class="t">were to take our previous example. So we had Jacquard and we need to pass strings here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.680</a></span> | <span class="t">It's fine. All we're going to do is 1, 2 and 3. And then here I'm just going to put 2 and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.680</a></span> | <span class="t">4. Same as we had before. We get 0.25 which is what we got before. So that is Jacquard</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Similarity. Let's move on to WShingling. Now WShingling is very similar to Jacquard but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.560</a></span> | <span class="t">rather than feeding in single words, we are feeding in n-grams. So an n-gram is essentially</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.640</a></span> | <span class="t">one or more words together. So for example, we place n with 1. That gives us a unigram.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And a unigram would just be what we did before where we're just taking each word like that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">as it is. So that would give us a list of single words. Now if we move one up from that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.400</a></span> | <span class="t">we can do 2-grams which is a bigram. And a bigram is obviously taking two at a time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So we would take these two words together and then we would also take these two words</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.080</a></span> | <span class="t">together. And we would keep going through taking two by two all the way until we get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to the end. And what we would get from that is a set where we have his thought. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">next we would have thought process. And so on and so on. So imagine we do the same as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.360</a></span> | <span class="t">we did with Jacquard Similarity but we do it with these n-grams. So bigrams, trigrams</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">or even unigrams, that is w-shingling. And if we were to write that out in Python, we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.240</a></span> | <span class="t">would get something like this. So we use this comprehension here. And what we're going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.920</a></span> | <span class="t">do is iterate through each item in sentence A. So this one up here. We're splitting that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">by space characters. And what I want to do is access each item in that list. So what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to do is put in range. And we're going to use the indexing to get each item</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.080</a></span> | <span class="t">within the list. So for A, I, for I in that range. So that's going to go through each</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">item. So we run that and we get each character there. So I just need to make sure that we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">actually split the list before we do that. So we'll just do here, A.split. And that means</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I can also remove that. So now we have all the words. But what we want to do is get sets</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">of two words at a time. So what we can do is we'll add a list here and we'll do A to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I plus one. So we get both of those together. And because we're doing that, we also need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=367" target="_blank">00:06:07.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to take a minus one at the end here so that we don't get an index error running through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=373" target="_blank">00:06:13.320</a></span> | <span class="t">the whole list with this plus one. And then we get two lists of words. Now, the way that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=382" target="_blank">00:06:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">we want to implement it here, I mean, you don't have to do this, but I think it looks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">a bit cleaner, is we can use this join. And then we put both of those words together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And then at the end of that, we'll be taking a set. Okay. And then once we have that set,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">we just run that through this exact same function here. So we would pass our new W Shingling</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=411" target="_blank">00:06:51.300</a></span> | <span class="t">set to X and Y and calculate the Jaccard similarity between them. And that would be W Shingling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=420" target="_blank">00:07:00.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's why I said a very similar because the actual calculation itself is the same.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=424" target="_blank">00:07:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just the approach that we take or the pre-processing on our strings before we actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=432" target="_blank">00:07:12.820</a></span> | <span class="t">feed it into the calculation. Now that's it for Jaccard and W Shingling. Let's move on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=439" target="_blank">00:07:19.460</a></span> | <span class="t">to Levenshtein distance. Now, this is the formula for Levenshtein distance. And I know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=446" target="_blank">00:07:26.940</a></span> | <span class="t">it looks quite confusing, or at least for me, looking at this the first time, it looks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=453" target="_blank">00:07:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">pretty complicated. If it doesn't, then that's great. But if it does look confusing, don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=459" target="_blank">00:07:39.220</a></span> | <span class="t">worry, we're going to break it down and work through it. And it will seem really simple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=462" target="_blank">00:07:42.580</a></span> | <span class="t">once we're done. So this is the formula for Levenshtein distance. Now, an easy way to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=472" target="_blank">00:07:52.580</a></span> | <span class="t">understand what is going on is using this matrix here. Now, with this matrix, I've sort</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=481" target="_blank">00:08:01.500</a></span> | <span class="t">of already filled in a few up here, but imagine they're not filled in because I'm going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=486" target="_blank">00:08:06.660</a></span> | <span class="t">explain why in a minute. So with this matrix, what we're going to do is we're going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=492" target="_blank">00:08:12.500</a></span> | <span class="t">work through each value or each cell within this matrix and calculate this formula for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=501" target="_blank">00:08:21.660</a></span> | <span class="t">it. So we start up here. And at this point, we have we have our two values. So we're going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=508" target="_blank">00:08:28.820</a></span> | <span class="t">to put i here. So this is these values or these rows are going to be i indices and here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=515" target="_blank">00:08:35.980</a></span> | <span class="t">we're going to have j. Now at this point, j is equal to zero. And so is i, okay, because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=523" target="_blank">00:08:43.380</a></span> | <span class="t">we are at cell zero, zero. So we start there, we come down to here. And we say, okay, if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=536" target="_blank">00:08:56.300</a></span> | <span class="t">the minimum of i or j is zero, then you need to pass over to this point here. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=545" target="_blank">00:09:05.500</a></span> | <span class="t">this tells you, you need to take the maximum value between either i or j. Now, i and j,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=551" target="_blank">00:09:11.740</a></span> | <span class="t">they're both zero. So the maximum value between both of those is zero. So that means we remove</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=561" target="_blank">00:09:21.380</a></span> | <span class="t">this x here. And that means that this value, so we pass that back here, the Levenshtein</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=569" target="_blank">00:09:29.860</a></span> | <span class="t">distance for this first item here is zero. So that's what we do. Now, at this point,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=577" target="_blank">00:09:37.140</a></span> | <span class="t">we move on to the next value. So we go this way. And then once we get to the end here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=584" target="_blank">00:09:44.300</a></span> | <span class="t">we move on to the next row and keep going that way. And all of these bits I've filled</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=595" target="_blank">00:09:55.340</a></span> | <span class="t">in here, they either have i equal to zero, or they're going to be j on this column here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=605" target="_blank">00:10:05.980</a></span> | <span class="t">is equal to zero. So that means you pass it through here. And you take the maximum value</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=612" target="_blank">00:10:12.620</a></span> | <span class="t">of either i or j. So for example, if we let's do it here, we're just ignoring these two</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=620" target="_blank">00:10:20.500</a></span> | <span class="t">words and I'll explain how we or why those two words are relevant in a minute. At this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=628" target="_blank">00:10:28.020</a></span> | <span class="t">point, j is equal to seven. So j is equal to seven. Now, that's because of we're on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=636" target="_blank">00:10:36.580</a></span> | <span class="t">the seventh column here. So we've gone 0, 1, 2, and so on and so on till we get seven.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=644" target="_blank">00:10:44.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So here j is equal to seven. So we have 0 and 7. We pass that through down here, we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=652" target="_blank">00:10:52.900</a></span> | <span class="t">get to if the minimum of either of those is equal to zero, which it is, because i is equal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=659" target="_blank">00:10:59.620</a></span> | <span class="t">to zero, we come over here. And we say, what's the maximum value of either of those? It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=667" target="_blank">00:11:07.860</a></span> | <span class="t">seven. So we remove all of this. And that means that this value here is equal to seven.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=680" target="_blank">00:11:20.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Now that's easy enough. But what happens when we start getting into these values here. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=687" target="_blank">00:11:27.340</a></span> | <span class="t">this is where things change a little bit. Now, with Levenstein's distance, what we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=695" target="_blank">00:11:35.260</a></span> | <span class="t">essentially doing is taking these two words and saying, what is the minimum or optimum</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=700" target="_blank">00:11:40.420</a></span> | <span class="t">number of operations for us to convert one word into another word? And when we look at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=706" target="_blank">00:11:46.900</a></span> | <span class="t">this equation down here, we actually see three alternative operations. And that is deletion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=715" target="_blank">00:11:55.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So here, delete. So this, maybe we have, for example, here, i, and over here, we have e.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=729" target="_blank">00:12:09.660</a></span> | <span class="t">If we wanted to convert Levenstein into this Livingston at the top, we would probably want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=735" target="_blank">00:12:15.980</a></span> | <span class="t">to delete this i, because then we would get, at the end, t-e-n, which matches up to what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=745" target="_blank">00:12:25.380</a></span> | <span class="t">we have up here. So we would want to delete that character. And so we would process it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=753" target="_blank">00:12:33.820</a></span> | <span class="t">through that delete operation. Below that, we have the insert operation. So this is inserting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=762" target="_blank">00:12:42.460</a></span> | <span class="t">a new character. So maybe we're going the other way. Maybe we were here at n, and we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=770" target="_blank">00:12:50.140</a></span> | <span class="t">were comparing against i. And we saw, OK, the best way for us to do this is to insert</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=776" target="_blank">00:12:56.340</a></span> | <span class="t">a new character, which would be i. And then here is the substitution operation. And this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=784" target="_blank">00:13:04.940</a></span> | <span class="t">is where you're swapping one character for another character. So in the example here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=794" target="_blank">00:13:14.780</a></span> | <span class="t">going from e to i up here, we might want to substitute that e for an i. So they're the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=809" target="_blank">00:13:29.780</a></span> | <span class="t">three operations that we have there. And whether you want to remember that or not, it's not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=818" target="_blank">00:13:38.180</a></span> | <span class="t">really that important, because we can implement this. And we don't really need to think too</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=822" target="_blank">00:13:42.820</a></span> | <span class="t">much about what each of those operations is actually doing. So let's just remove those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=829" target="_blank">00:13:49.540</a></span> | <span class="t">for now. And let's work through an example. So we have this first example here at j equals</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=838" target="_blank">00:13:58.020</a></span> | <span class="t">1, and i equals 1. So we have 1 and 1. Now we come down here. We have this. Is the minimum</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=848" target="_blank">00:14:08.980</a></span> | <span class="t">of i or j equal to 0? No, they're both 1. So that means we have to go to the else here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=855" target="_blank">00:14:15.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we pass through this. So what we are saying here is, what is the minimum value</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=866" target="_blank">00:14:26.460</a></span> | <span class="t">of all of these? So what is the Levenshtein value that we already calculated at i minus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=874" target="_blank">00:14:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">1 j? So i minus 1 j is at position 0, 1, because it's 1 minus 1 for the i, and just 1 for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=886" target="_blank">00:14:46.180</a></span> | <span class="t">j. So what do we have there? So 0, 1. So i, 0, and j, 1. Here, we have this 1 value. Because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=899" target="_blank">00:14:59.020</a></span> | <span class="t">at this point, we've already calculated, because we go in that order. We go start from the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=904" target="_blank">00:15:04.820</a></span> | <span class="t">top, and go all the way right, onto the next row, and so on. So we always have these numbers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=909" target="_blank">00:15:09.740</a></span> | <span class="t">calculated by the time we get to comparing the minimum value.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=915" target="_blank">00:15:15.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have 0 and 1 there. And the number is 1. So let's remove that. And we say, OK, this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=928" target="_blank">00:15:28.360</a></span> | <span class="t">is equal to 1. What's the next part? We have i and j minus 1. So at position 1, and j minus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=942" target="_blank">00:15:42.460</a></span> | <span class="t">1, which is 0. So what do we have there? So we have here, and here, we again have another</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=949" target="_blank">00:15:49.580</a></span> | <span class="t">1. OK, so we say that's equal to 1. Then we come to this final one here, i minus 1, j</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=958" target="_blank">00:15:58.140</a></span> | <span class="t">minus 1. OK, so that means 0, 0. So position 0, 0. What do we have there? OK, we have this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=967" target="_blank">00:16:07.340</a></span> | <span class="t">number 0. There we go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=972" target="_blank">00:16:12.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So we take the minimum value of those, which is obviously this 0 value here. And we have--</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=979" target="_blank">00:16:19.780</a></span> | <span class="t">so this is going to be equal to 0. Then we have this, this here. And what this part of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=987" target="_blank">00:16:27.060</a></span> | <span class="t">the formula is telling us is we need to add 1 if ai is not equal to bi. So up here, something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=998" target="_blank">00:16:38.380</a></span> | <span class="t">I didn't explain, but a is this word. And b is the other word. So at ai, we have l.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1012" target="_blank">00:16:52.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And at jb, we have l. Are both of those the same? Yes, they are. So that means we don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1019" target="_blank">00:16:59.120</a></span> | <span class="t">need to add the 1. OK, so then that means that our value here is equal to 0. And this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1031" target="_blank">00:17:11.220</a></span> | <span class="t">looks like a 0. I didn't mean for it to. It's actually supposed to be a circle. So this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1035" target="_blank">00:17:15.580</a></span> | <span class="t">is a 0. Now, let's remove all that for now. And let's do one more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1049" target="_blank">00:17:29.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's try and make this one quick. So here, we have i is equal to 1, j is equal to 2.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1057" target="_blank">00:17:37.140</a></span> | <span class="t">We come down. We know that neither of those are 0. We come to here, come to here. OK,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1063" target="_blank">00:17:43.540</a></span> | <span class="t">what is at position 0, 2? 0, 2, we have a 2. So this is equal to 2. At position 1, 1,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1079" target="_blank">00:17:59.300</a></span> | <span class="t">what do we have? So 1, 1. So this is a 0. And then we have position i minus 1, j minus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1093" target="_blank">00:18:13.420</a></span> | <span class="t">1. So that is i equals 0 and j equals 1, which is this 1 here. So we have 1. What's the minimum</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1103" target="_blank">00:18:23.180</a></span> | <span class="t">value of all those? It's a 0. And are ai and bj the same here? Well, ai is our l again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1117" target="_blank">00:18:37.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And bj is an i this time. This is i up here. So they're not the same. So this time, we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1126" target="_blank">00:18:46.460</a></span> | <span class="t">do 1 plus 0. So then, up here, we put a 1. And then we would just keep doing that for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1136" target="_blank">00:18:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">every single value going in this direction. We'd go to the end, and then we'd move on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1141" target="_blank">00:19:01.740</a></span> | <span class="t">to the next row, going in this direction again, until we get all the way to the end. By the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1146" target="_blank">00:19:06.900</a></span> | <span class="t">time we get to the end, it's going to look something like this. And what we do when we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1155" target="_blank">00:19:15.860</a></span> | <span class="t">get this is we look at the value that we see in the bottom right corner, which is here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1164" target="_blank">00:19:24.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Or if you're in Python, we would get that value by indexing at minus 1, minus 1. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1175" target="_blank">00:19:35.420</a></span> | <span class="t">that is our Levenshtein value. And you can see this is almost like the optimal path through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1186" target="_blank">00:19:46.380</a></span> | <span class="t">our matrix. So we're just following this line all the way over here. So here, we had to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1191" target="_blank">00:19:51.980</a></span> | <span class="t">move a little bit. And then we find our optimum number of operations is 3. So there's 3 deletions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1202" target="_blank">00:20:02.180</a></span> | <span class="t">insertions, or substitutions needed to go from our initial word over to our other word.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1210" target="_blank">00:20:10.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Now how does that work in Python? Well, in Python, it looks like this. So at the start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1220" target="_blank">00:20:20.500</a></span> | <span class="t">here, we add an additional character. So if you remember from the matrix, you see we had</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1231" target="_blank">00:20:31.260</a></span> | <span class="t">this first initial part here. These are just empty characters. And we replicate that in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1239" target="_blank">00:20:39.260</a></span> | <span class="t">our code by adding these spaces here. And then after that, what we do is initialize</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1248" target="_blank">00:20:48.260</a></span> | <span class="t">a empty array. So that is our first stage that we saw before. So we have that empty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1255" target="_blank">00:20:55.420</a></span> | <span class="t">array. It's just going to be 0s at this point. And then we begin iterating through each value</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1260" target="_blank">00:21:00.860</a></span> | <span class="t">and finding the best path. So we have i and j here, as we saw before, exactly the same.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1271" target="_blank">00:21:11.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have i, which corresponds to our word or sentence a, and j, which corresponds to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1277" target="_blank">00:21:17.100</a></span> | <span class="t">our word or sentence b. And then we say, if the minimum of i or j is equal to 0, then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1286" target="_blank">00:21:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">we calculate that position as the maximum of i or j. So exactly the same as what we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1292" target="_blank">00:21:32.500</a></span> | <span class="t">covered before with that matrix and the formula. So that is the top line here. So this bit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1305" target="_blank">00:21:45.780</a></span> | <span class="t">followed by this. So the exact same. We're saying, if the minimum, then choose the maximum.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1313" target="_blank">00:21:53.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, in our logic, we move on to the else. So if the minimum of i or j is not equal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1319" target="_blank">00:21:59.500</a></span> | <span class="t">to 0, just like we did in that formula, we do this. So we say, we calculate those three</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1327" target="_blank">00:22:07.100</a></span> | <span class="t">rows that we had. So those three possible operations with deletion, insertion, or substitution.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1334" target="_blank">00:22:14.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we take the minimum value of all of those, so the best path. And then, if our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1344" target="_blank">00:22:24.380</a></span> | <span class="t">two current characters don't match, we add 1. So again, we saw that in the formula before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1355" target="_blank">00:22:35.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Right here. So we're saying, if the characters a and b don't match, add 1. And if so, we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1364" target="_blank">00:22:44.420</a></span> | <span class="t">do the same. So we run through. We do that for every position in our matrix. And then,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1371" target="_blank">00:22:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">what we do down here is return. I return matrix. And then, I also return the actual Levenstein</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1376" target="_blank">00:22:56.900</a></span> | <span class="t">distance from the final point in that matrix. So the bottom right value. So we have that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1386" target="_blank">00:23:06.060</a></span> | <span class="t">here. So let's see how it does on our example. So we have these two words. I think this should</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1397" target="_blank">00:23:17.940</a></span> | <span class="t">be a h. Let's have a look. Yep. So we need that to be a h. So we're going to run both</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1408" target="_blank">00:23:28.060</a></span> | <span class="t">of those through our formula here. Let's have a look at what we get. OK. So run all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1418" target="_blank">00:23:38.840</a></span> | <span class="t">way through. So I can see here. So this is supposed to be an i Levenstein. OK. And then,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1425" target="_blank">00:23:45.780</a></span> | <span class="t">we get this value. So we get, in our matrix, see that the final value is at 3. And then,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1431" target="_blank">00:23:51.220</a></span> | <span class="t">we also pull that out here as well. So those are our three traditional similarity search</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1444" target="_blank">00:24:04.760</a></span> | <span class="t">techniques and how we can use them in language. Now, all of them are, I think, they're all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1454" target="_blank">00:24:14.020</a></span> | <span class="t">very popular and with good reason. And it's definitely worth being able to use them. Now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1459" target="_blank">00:24:19.620</a></span> | <span class="t">the one place where these sort of struggle is where we are maybe looking at more semantical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1467" target="_blank">00:24:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">meaning. So for example, if I were to say the words "hi" and "hello," although they have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1473" target="_blank">00:24:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the same meaning, none of these techniques would be able to identify those two words</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1479" target="_blank">00:24:39.480</a></span> | <span class="t">as being similar or matching. And in that case, we would kind of need to move into the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1486" target="_blank">00:24:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">more vector-based similarity search methods. And in particular, where we start using dense</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1494" target="_blank">00:24:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">vectors for representing those words. But for simple comparisons, where we're comparing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1502" target="_blank">00:25:02.780</a></span> | <span class="t">the syntax between two sentences or words, these traditional approaches are incredibly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1509" target="_blank">00:25:09.400</a></span> | <span class="t">useful and incredibly powerful. But that's it for this video. So I hope you've enjoyed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY62z7HrghY&t=1517" target="_blank">00:25:17.160</a></span> | <span class="t">it. And I will see you in the next one.</span></div></div></body></html>
