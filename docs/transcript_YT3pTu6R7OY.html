And usually it would be six months later that suddenly it would click. And so I think I thought of myself as sort of slow, but I never grew up in some sense. And as far as I can tell, I've been getting better at things slowly and steadily. It was only when I was older that I noticed that most people do something wonderful and then they get stuck. And I started to make theories of why do people get stuck and how to avoid it. And the best thing is to, if you've done something, you should be ashamed of it instead of proud of it. And I notice a lot of people keep saying, "Well, I thought of that a long time ago," and they keep trying to get recognition. And why bother?</p></div></div></body></html>
