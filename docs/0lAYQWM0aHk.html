2011, mostly because I met a Chinese girl who I fell in love with, and we got married.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

together</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lAYQWM0aHk&t=167">00:02:47.800</a></span> | <span class="t">in Hong Kong, still married now, have a

research there with Jin You at Hong Kong</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lAYQWM0aHk&t=182">00:03:02.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Polytechnic

have in South China.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lAYQWM0aHk&t=212">00:03:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">People here cannot imagine what

also.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lAYQWM0aHk&t=219">00:03:39.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I invited him to Hong Kong to give a talk at Hong

investors who were interested in his robots.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lAYQWM0aHk&t=229">00:03:49.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And he didn't have Sophia then, he had a robot of Philip K. Dick, our favorite science fiction</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lAYQWM0aHk&t=234">00:03:54.240</a></span> | <span

little toy robots that looked like his son Zeno.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lAYQWM0aHk&t=239">00:03:59.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So through the investors I connected him to, he managed to get some funding to basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lAYQWM0aHk&t=245">00:04:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">port Hanson Robotics to Hong Kong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lAYQWM0aHk&t=248">00:04:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And when he first moved to Hong Kong, I was working on AGI research and also on this machine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lAYQWM0aHk&t=254">00:04:14.980</a></span> | <span class="t">learning trading project.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lAYQWM0aHk&t=257">00:04:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So I didn't get that tightly involved with Hanson Robotics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lAYQWM0aHk&t=260">00:04:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But as I hung out with David more and more, as we were both there in the same place, I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lAYQWM0aHk&t=267">00:04:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">started to think about what you could do to make his robots smarter than they were.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lAYQWM0aHk&t=276">00:04:36.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we started working together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lAYQWM0aHk&t=278">00:04:38.200</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lAYQWM0aHk&t=283">00:04:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Then when I got deeply into the blockchain side of things, I stepped back from that and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lAYQWM0aHk&t=289">00:04:49.700</a></span> | <span class="t">co-founded SingularityNet.</span></div><div

SingularityNet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lAYQWM0aHk&t=295">00:04:55.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So part of our goal there had been to make the blockchain-based CloudMind platform for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lAYQWM0aHk&t=302">00:05:02.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Sophia

robots in SingularityNet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lAYQWM0aHk&t=308">00:05:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lAYQWM0aHk&t=312">00:05:12.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Many copies of the Sophia robot would be among the user interfaces to the globally distributed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lAYQWM0aHk&t=320">00:05:20.600</a></span> | <span

talked about that for quite a while before co-founding SingularityNet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lAYQWM0aHk&t=328">00:05:28.480</a></span> |

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lAYQWM0aHk&t=337">00:05:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Or was the idea that you can just keep plugging in different AI systems within the head

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lAYQWM0aHk&t=343">00:05:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I think David's view was always that Sophia would be a platform, much like, say, the

their different AI algorithms on that platform.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lAYQWM0aHk&t=366">00:06:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And

making this robot interact in a meaningful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lAYQWM0aHk&t=601">00:10:01.100</a></span> | <span class="t">way, because

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lAYQWM0aHk&t=619">00:10:19.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So the robot always sounded stupid, because it wasn't getting the right text, right?</span></div><div

mean, where the walking skeleton is in software development is, if you're building a complex</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lAYQWM0aHk&t=641">00:10:41.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, one way is to first build part one well, then build part two well, then build part</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lAYQWM0aHk&t=645">00:10:45.540</a></span> | <span class="t">three well, and so on.</span></div><div

put something in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lAYQWM0aHk&t=652">00:10:52.220</a></span> | <span class="t">place of every part the whole system will need, so that you have a whole system that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lAYQWM0aHk&t=656">00:10:56.200</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lAYQWM0aHk&t=665">00:11:05.980</a></span> | <span class="t">We made like a walking skeleton software system where, so there's something that sees, there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lAYQWM0aHk&t=670">00:11:10.940</a></span> | <span class="t">something that hears, there's something that

there's a lot of AI in there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lAYQWM0aHk&t=687">00:11:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">There's not any AGI in

current chat bot, the Facebook deep neural chat bot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lAYQWM0aHk&t=770">00:12:50.900</a></span> | <span

really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lAYQWM0aHk&t=1367">00:22:47.100</a></span> | <span class="t">just being an outlet for what a human

OpenCog behind Sophia, where there's more learning and reasoning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lAYQWM0aHk&t=1379">00:22:59.980</a></span> |

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lAYQWM0aHk&t=1386">00:23:06.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Because whether she's really learning or thinking, or just appears to be, over a half</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lAYQWM0aHk&t=1391">00:23:11.580</a></span> | <span class="t">hour I could tell, but over like three or four

having three systems that's already sufficiently complex, where you can't really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

working,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lAYQWM0aHk&t=1407">00:23:27.500</a></span> | <span class="t">and then they talk to her, they still attribute more agency and consciousness to her than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lAYQWM0aHk&t=1414">00:23:34.540</a></span> | <span class="t">is
