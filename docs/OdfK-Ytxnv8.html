I think of the fact that there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdfK-Ytxnv8&t=68" target="_blank">00:01:08.920</a></span> | <span class="t">are many people who, for instance, in the 19th and mid, up to the mid-20th century,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdfK-Ytxnv8&t=75" target="_blank">00:01:15.240</a></span> | <span class="t">didn't divorce because there would have been a social cost that came along with divorcing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdfK-Ytxnv8&t=80" target="_blank">00:01:20.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And that external pressure kept that from happening.

It's a sort of implicit prosperity gospel. And that's all being stripped away</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdfK-Ytxnv8&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">right now because as American society secularizes, it's no longer necessary to be identified</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdfK-Ytxnv8&t=111" target="_blank">00:01:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">in a cultural nominal sense with Christianity. That's, I think, going to be good for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdfK-Ytxnv8&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">church. And there are several ways that we can respond to this that I think would be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdfK-Ytxnv8&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.200</a></span> | <span class="t">less than helpful. One of them would be denial that is happening and just to assume, "Let's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdfK-Ytxnv8&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.720</a></span> | <span class="t">just keep doing what we're doing right now, except more so, and somehow we'll be able</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdfK-Ytxnv8&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.460</a></span> | <span class="t">to turn this around." If we don't understand what's happening in the culture around us,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdfK-Ytxnv8&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">we don't understand why the culture is starting to not ask certain questions, and why the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdfK-Ytxnv8&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">culture is seeing Christianity as freakish, then we're not going to be able to address</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdfK-Ytxnv8&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.920</a></span> | <span class="t">it. Another bad response, I think, would be a sort of a negotiated settlement, which is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdfK-Ytxnv8&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">to say, "We will strip away some of the aspects of Christianity that the ambient culture finds</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdfK-Ytxnv8&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">unpalatable so that they will like us." Now, the problem with that is, one, it isn't Christian.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdfK-Ytxnv8&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It isn't right. You can't grow Christian churches with sub-Christian theology. But secondly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdfK-Ytxnv8&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">it doesn't even work because the culture isn't going to allow that sort of negotiated settlement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdfK-Ytxnv8&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.960</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what the older liberals wanted to do with, for instance, the miraculous, and now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdfK-Ytxnv8&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">people are wanting to do that with sexual morality. It doesn't even work. That's the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdfK-Ytxnv8&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">reason why the Episcopal Church and the Presbyterian Church USA are in a state of freefall and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdfK-Ytxnv8&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">collapse. It just doesn't work. Another bad response, I think, would be withdrawal. Let's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdfK-Ytxnv8&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.120</a></span> | <span class="t">simply sort of retreat back to our enclaves, into our churches, and not worry about what's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdfK-Ytxnv8&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">going on in the culture on the outside. The problem with that is, first of all, that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdfK-Ytxnv8&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.160</a></span> | <span class="t">impossible to do. There's no way to escape from the culture around us. And it also is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdfK-Ytxnv8&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.160</a></span> | <span class="t">a surrendering of a crucial part of our mission, which is to shape people's consciences, to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdfK-Ytxnv8&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">enable people to be able to carry out all of their responsibilities.

And he had to have a word for them as to how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdfK-Ytxnv8&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.940</a></span> | <span class="t">they were to live, carry out their responsibilities, and still be faithful now to this new repentance</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdfK-Ytxnv8&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that they have embraced, Luke chapter 3. We have to be able to do that as well. Another</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdfK-Ytxnv8&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.080</a></span> | <span class="t">bad response, I think, is a sort of siege mentality, which is to respond to the culture</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdfK-Ytxnv8&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.540</a></span> | <span class="t">outside with anger and with hostility, simply to express outrage about what's going on around</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdfK-Ytxnv8&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.940</a></span> | <span class="t">us. And that's easy to do, because it's easy to find one sort of cultural atrocity after</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdfK-Ytxnv8&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.980</a></span> | <span class="t">another. And we can just kind of talk to one another by saying, "Can you believe how bad</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdfK-Ytxnv8&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.400</a></span> | <span class="t">it's getting out there?" And we can sort of reinforce the fear that we have about what's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdfK-Ytxnv8&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.500</a></span> | <span class="t">happening on the outside and what's happening in the culture in a way that isn't fundamentally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdfK-Ytxnv8&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Christian. I think that the verse that we probably need to be remembering more than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdfK-Ytxnv8&t=305" target="_blank">00:05:05.660</a></span> | <span class="t">anything else in the years to come is when Jesus says, "Fear not, little flock, because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdfK-Ytxnv8&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.240</a></span> | <span class="t">it is the Father's good pleasure to give to you the kingdom." Jesus says what the Bible</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdfK-Ytxnv8&t=319" target="_blank">00:05:19.800</a></span> | <span class="t">says consistently, "Fear not." And why does He say that? He says, "Because you have the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdfK-Ytxnv8&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.300</a></span> | <span class="t">hope of, despite the fact that right now you are a little flock."
