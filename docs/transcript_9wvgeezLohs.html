The problem with being an optimizer is that it can actually serve you really well. Like you over-save, you set yourself up amazingly well, you've done great. Every day you look and you're like, oh, the number's going up, like I'm so cool, let me keep doing it.</p><p>The problem is that if you take it to its logical extreme, optimizers become unbearably boring and unbearably cheap. They look at cost, the price of a lunch, they go, oh, that taco, we could get it today. But if we actually take the money and invest it for the next 45 years, that $12 will actually turn into $1,664 and they just end up doing nothing.</p><p>I love optimizers because I get them. It's kind of funny, but also it's not funny. I want them to realize there's a certain point where you won. You won the game. The point is not to look at another model or another fire subreddit. It's actually to have gratitude, give yourself a big pat on the back, celebrate, and then turn the page and start focusing on the next chapter, which often is learning the skill of spending money meaningfully.</p></div></div></body></html>
