And I retweeted it as a matter of fact. "But I also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=36" target="_blank">00:00:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">see a lot of social media photos of Christians doing good deeds, say, and helping with hurricane</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=41" target="_blank">00:00:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">relief.

That's Jesus' command in Matthew 6.1.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=62" target="_blank">00:01:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Any thoughts on how to balance these two truths on social media?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=66" target="_blank">00:01:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, let's put the texts in front of us, and then I'll try to make some distinctions. First,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=72" target="_blank">00:01:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Jesus lays down this warning and principle in Matthew 6.1. "Beware of practicing your righteousness</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=81" target="_blank">00:01:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">before other people in order to be seen by them, for then you will have no reward from your Father</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=86" target="_blank">00:01:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">who's in heaven." Now, that's a kind of aim to be seen, which is evil, he says. Shouldn't do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And part of the evil of the aim to be seen is that it signals you are not content with your Father's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=104" target="_blank">00:01:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">reward. You need to add. You crave a human praise, and so God's reward is not sufficient for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">You need to supplement it by a little human adulation, and that's what makes it so evil.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Then Jesus gives us an example of what he means with regard to doing good to the needy in the next</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">four verses. He says this. This is Matthew 6.2. "Thus, when you give to the needy, sound no trumpet</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">before you. Don't tweak your soup kitchen stint at Thanksgiving, as the hypocrites do in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">synagogues and in the streets, that they may be praised by others. Truly I say to you, they have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">received their reward, not from God, but from man." Obviously, God's wasn't enough. "But when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">you give to the needy, don't let your left hand know what your right hand is doing." In other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">words, do it so quietly that your right hand is able to make the gift to the needy, and your left</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">hand was just hanging at the other side, didn't even know what happened. "So that your giving may</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">be in secret, and your father who sees in secret will reward you." So there's the warning and the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">principle. Don't aim to be praised by others, and therefore avoid behaviors that look like that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">like sounding a trumpet, or tweeting, or Instagramming, your piety and your good deeds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I have a real problem with people who simply say, "Praying for all the hurt people in Las Vegas."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, now, if you want to call people to prayer, yes. If you want to quote a Bible verse that would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">encourage people to pray, but I just don't get it when people say, "Hey, hey everybody, I want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">tell about 10,000 people I'm praying." Okay, don't want to be too hard, but I just don't get that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">It just seems so contrary to this text, like when you pray, go into your closet. In fact, it says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">"Make a concerted effort that your righteousness, your generosity to the poor not be seen by others,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">but be done in secret." Now, here's the counterpoint that Stephen is referring to in Matthew 5,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">14 to 16 that creates the problem, and it is a real problem. I don't presume to have all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">answers here, but here's the problem. Jesus says in Matthew 5, 14, "You are the light of the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">A city set on a hill cannot be hidden, nor do people put a lamp, nor do people light a lamp</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and put it under a basket, but on a stand that it may give light to all in the house. In the same</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">way, let your light shine before others so that they may see your good works and give glory to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">your Father who is in heaven." So here's a few observations. One, there are many practical good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">deeds that simply cannot be hidden, especially from those for whom you're doing the deeds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.240</a></span> | <span class="t">You can't stop and help somebody change a tire without them watching you do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">You can't risk your life at a public act of terrorism to rescue a child without the crowd</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=316" target="_blank">00:05:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">seeing what you're doing. You can't join an emergency sandbagging effort to prevent flooding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=322" target="_blank">00:05:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">without being part of a hundred people who are doing the same thing. My guess is that this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=328" target="_blank">00:05:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">what Jesus has in mind. He's mainly talking about public doing of good deeds of mercy and justice</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=338" target="_blank">00:05:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">that you can't hide because they're public. I suspect, in fact, that Paul is thinking about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">those in 1 Timothy 5:25 when he says, "So also good works are conspicuous, and even those that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=353" target="_blank">00:05:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">are not cannot remain hidden." I'll bet he's pondering this. In other words, there are many</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">kinds of good deeds which simply by their very nature can't be hidden, and there are some that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">can be. Like if you go online to click and give whatever amount you want to give,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=375" target="_blank">00:06:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a little button that says "Give anonymously." A real test, right? I want them to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">know I did this! I don't think so. By their very nature, some can be hidden, and Paul says they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=393" target="_blank">00:06:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">going to be found out later. Somebody's going to know, and he's okay with that. And I think so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=399" target="_blank">00:06:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">should we be, because later it will probably have more possibilities of bringing glory to God rather</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=407" target="_blank">00:06:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">than bringing glory to you, because people will realize you never did try to draw attention to it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=411" target="_blank">00:06:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and yet you were doing it, and it came out at your funeral.

He says the eternal well-being</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=443" target="_blank">00:07:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">of the person in worshiping, being part of the worshiping family of God, is the goal of all of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=450" target="_blank">00:07:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">our good deeds to them.

That's the great goal. Christians are never merely public do-gooders. We do not want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=466" target="_blank">00:07:46.560</a></span> | <span class="t">to be known as merely public do-gooders.

Certainly comes to the fore in Twitter and Instagram and other social media.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=512" target="_blank">00:08:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And we know this is merely human. It's not godly. And so nobody is going to think of glorifying God</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=523" target="_blank">00:08:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">when they see us do it, right? I mean, I look at things, I'm not the least inclined to glorify God</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=530" target="_blank">00:08:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">when some Christian toots his own horn about all the good things he's doing.

There goes a few more millennial people who look at all of us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=540" target="_blank">00:09:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Christians and say, "Well, I'm done with that because that's just purely human." So I conclude</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=546" target="_blank">00:09:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">that Jesus is calling for both in Matthew 5 and 6. So let me sum it up like this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=556" target="_blank">00:09:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">One, that we should be deeply content with the reward of God, knowing him, loving him,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=565" target="_blank">00:09:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">treasuring him as supremely satisfying and glorious. That's first thing. Number two,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=571" target="_blank">00:09:31.520</a></span> | <span class="t">that we would not crave the praise of man because God himself is not enough for us,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=577" target="_blank">00:09:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">which is what craving signifies.

And three, that we would avoid ways of showing our piety</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=593" target="_blank">00:09:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">or showing good deeds which aim at getting praise from other people. Now that's tricky. I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=602" target="_blank">00:10:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">presume to say that's black and white always, but that's our aim. And four, that we should genuinely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=610" target="_blank">00:10:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">love people, which means both doing good things to help them practically, materially, temporally,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=618" target="_blank">00:10:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and passionately desiring through those good things that they would come to worship God and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dj8wyS4YPk&t=625" target="_blank">00:10:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">give glory to him.
