The only thing Moses didn't do was the subway, and many people have criticized him because the subways were deteriorated between the time they were built in the early part of the 20th century and 1974 when Carroll wrote The Power Broker, but so had public transit systems all over the United States.</p><p>That trajectory has changed. I mean, the steep drop in all these other cities in the Midwest and Northeast, they all declined except New York City, which even though it was way bigger than any of them in 1950, is bigger now than it was then. Moses had something to do with that.</p></div></div></body></html>
