hopefully</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">isn't terrifying at all because you already know what the paper says.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.680</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:02:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Read the paper for the thing you just learned about, and go back over it and please ask</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">on the forums if there's a bit of notation or anything that you don't understand, or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">if there's something we heard in

that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So please feel free, and if you're watching this later in the MOOC, again, feel free to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=199"

myself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And the thing that I think we all were a bit shocked about was putting this guy into the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.920</a></span> | <span class="t">device model and getting out more pictures of similar looking fish in nets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was kind of curious about how that was working and how well that was working, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I then completely broke things by training it for a few more epochs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And after doing that, I then did an image similarity search again and I got these three</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">guys who were no longer in nets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm not quite sure what's going on here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And the other thing I mentioned is when I trained it where my starting point was what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.080</a></span> | <span class="t">we looked at in class, which was just before the final bottleneck layer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I didn't get very good results from this thing, but when I trained it from the starting point</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">of just after the bottleneck layer, I got the good results that you saw.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, I don't know why that is, and I don't think this has been studied as far as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm aware.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's lots of open questions here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But I'll show you something I did then do was I thought, well, that's interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I think what's happened here is that when you train it for longer, it knows that the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">important thing is the fish and not the net.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And it seems to be now focusing on giving us the same kind of fish.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.840</a></span> | <span class="t">These are clearly the exact same type of fish, I guess.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So I started wondering how could we force it to combine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So I tried the most obvious possible thing, I wanted to get more fish in nets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And I typed Word2VecticTensh, that's a kind of fish, plus Word2VecticNet divided by 2,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">get the average of the 2 word vectors, and give me the nearest neighbor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's what I got.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And then just to prove it wasn't a fluke, I tried the same on Tensh plus Rod, and there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.520</a></span> |

like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=697" target="_blank">00:11:37.400</a></span> | <span class="t">what are the hacky shortcuts we

can see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=727" target="_blank">00:12:07.560</a></span> | <span class="t">is very simple, if x is greater

simple.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=1294" target="_blank">00:21:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">This paper is looking at the accuracy versus the size and the speed of different networks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=1305" target="_blank">00:21:45.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So the size of a bubble is how big is the network, how many parameters does it have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=1311" target="_blank">00:21:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can see VGG 16 and VGG 19 are by far the biggest of any of these networks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=1318" target="_blank">00:21:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Interestingly the second

accurate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=1344" target="_blank">00:22:24.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, there's definitely

significantly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=1364" target="_blank">00:22:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">more accurate and faster

that's why you see eventually a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=1873" target="_blank">00:31:13.460</a></span> | <span class="t">hole

target="_blank">00:31:39.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Think of it in the way your DICOM viewer can if you have a 3D button like this one does.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=1907" target="_blank">00:31:47.620</a></span> | <span class="t">That's actually what we were just looking at.</span></div><div class="c"><span

that you think of it as a 3D volume, because you're looking in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=1930" target="_blank">00:32:10.180</a></span> | <span class="t">this space.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=1932"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=1934" target="_blank">00:32:14.940</a></span> | <span class="t">What you're looking for is you're looking for somebody who has lung

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=1953" target="_blank">00:32:33.220</a></span> | <span class="t">is where people start to get particularly concerned about a blob.</span></div><div

they flick through a scan like this, is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=1963" target="_blank">00:32:43.420</a></span> | <span class="t">that they're looking for a dot which doesn't move, but which appears, gets bigger and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=1971" target="_blank">00:32:51.340</a></span> | <span class="t">disappears.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=1972" target="_blank">00:32:52.340</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what a blob looks like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=1974" target="_blank">00:32:54.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can see why radiologists very, very, very often miss nodules in lungs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=1983" target="_blank">00:33:03.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Because in all this area, you've got to have extraordinary vision to be able to see every</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=1989" target="_blank">00:33:09.060</a></span> | <span class="t">little blob appear and then disappear again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=1991" target="_blank">00:33:11.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And remember, the sooner you catch it, you get a 10x improved chance of survival.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=2000" target="_blank">00:33:20.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And generally speaking, when a radiologist looks at one of these scans, they're not looking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=2006" target="_blank">00:33:26.380</a></span> | <span class="t">for nodules, they're looking for something else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=2009" target="_blank">00:33:29.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Because lung cancer, at least in the earlier stages, is asymptomatic, it doesn't cause</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=2014" target="_blank">00:33:34.300</a></span> | <span class="t">you to feel different.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=2016" target="_blank">00:33:36.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's like something that every radiologist has to be thinking about when they're looking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=2019" target="_blank">00:33:39.620</a></span> | <span class="t">for pneumonia or whatever else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=2023" target="_blank">00:33:43.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's the basic idea is that we're going to try and come up with in the next half hour</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=2029" target="_blank">00:33:49.220</a></span> | <span class="t">or so some idea about how would you find these blobs, how would you find these nodules.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=2035" target="_blank">00:33:55.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So each of these things generally is about 512x512 by a couple of hundred.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=2048" target="_blank">00:34:08.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And the equivalent of a pixel in 3D space is called a voxel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=2052" target="_blank">00:34:12.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So a voxel simply means a pixel in 3D space.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=2056" target="_blank">00:34:16.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So this here is rendering a bunch of voxels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=2065" target="_blank">00:34:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Each voxel in a CT scan is a 12-bit integer, if memory serves me correctly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=2075" target="_blank">00:34:35.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And a computer screen can only show 8 bits of grayscale, and furthermore your eyes can't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=2082" target="_blank">00:34:42.660</a></span> | <span class="t">necessarily distinguish between all those grayscale perfectly anyway.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=2086" target="_blank">00:34:46.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So what every DICOM viewer provides is something called a windowing adjustment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=2093" target="_blank">00:34:53.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So a windowing adjustment, here is the default window, which is designed to basically map</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=2101" target="_blank">00:35:01.880</a></span> | <span class="t">some subset of that 12-bit space to the screen so that it highlights certain things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=2108" target="_blank">00:35:08.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the units CT scans use are called Hounsfield units, and certain ranges of Hounsfield units</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=2119" target="_blank">00:35:19.380</a></span> | <span class="t">tell you that something is some particular part of the body.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=2123" target="_blank">00:35:23.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you can see here that the bone is being lit up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=2126" target="_blank">00:35:26.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So we've selected an image window which is designed to allow us to see the bone clearly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=2133" target="_blank">00:35:33.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So what I did when I opened this was I switched it to CT's chest, which is some kind person</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=2141" target="_blank">00:35:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">has already figured out what

of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=2167" target="_blank">00:36:07.860</a></span> | <span class="t">course the deep learning algorithm

target="_blank">00:55:42.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And the really simple way to do that is just to randomly pick a point, and then start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=3353" target="_blank">00:55:53.860</a></span> | <span class="t">randomly picking points which are as far away as possible from all the previous ones I've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=3360" target="_blank">00:56:00.660</a></span> | <span class="t">picked.</span></div><div

would be our starting point for cluster 1, and say what point is the furthest away</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=3373"

iteratively move every point, so you basically then say these are the clusters,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=3394"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=3468" target="_blank">00:57:48.780</a></span> | <span class="t">this kind of thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=3499" target="_blank">00:58:19.580</a></span> | <span class="t">It would be better if I didn't do 5 steps, but I kept doing this until it was stable,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=3503" target="_blank">00:58:23.560</a></span> | <span class="t">but for now I'm just going to do 5 steps.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=3506" target="_blank">00:58:26.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And each step I'm going to go through, so our data is x, I'm going to go through, enumerate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=3512" target="_blank">00:58:32.540</a></span> | <span class="t">through our data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=3513" target="_blank">00:58:33.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So small x is the current data point I'm looking at.</span></div><div

subtract</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=3552" target="_blank">00:59:12.920</a></span> | <span class="t">a matrix from a vector, and

square</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=3571" target="_blank">00:59:31.780</a></span> | <span class="t">root, this is going to return a vector of distances of small x to every element of big</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=3581" target="_blank">00:59:41.460</a></span> | <span class="t">X.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=3584" target="_blank">00:59:44.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And the sum here is

know for this particular data point, how far away is it from all of the other data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=3596"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=3604" target="_blank">01:00:04.340</a></span> | <span class="t">The final step will be to take a weighted average.</span></div><div class="c"><span

to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=3615" target="_blank">01:00:15.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's draw this.</span></div><div

currently looking at this one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=3634" target="_blank">01:00:34.260</a></span> | <span class="t">What

target="_blank">01:00:43.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And the basic idea is now what we want to do is take the weighted average of all of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=3649" target="_blank">01:00:49.420</a></span> | <span class="t">those data points, weighted by the inverse of that distance.</span></div><div

weight very small.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=3658" target="_blank">01:00:58.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And the things that

class="t">So I think this is probably the closest, and this is about the second-closest, and this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=4135" target="_blank">01:08:55.380</a></span> | <span class="t">You can see anywhere I used to have np, it now says torch, np.array is now torch.flow_tensor,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=4145" target="_blank">01:09:05.460</a></span> | <span class="t">np.square_root is

<span class="t">One issue is that torch doesn't support broadcasting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=4158" target="_blank">01:09:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we'll talk more about this shortly in a couple of weeks, but basically I decided that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=4163" target="_blank">01:09:23.020</a></span> | <span class="t">not okay, so I wrote my own broadcasting library for PyTorch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=4166" target="_blank">01:09:26.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So rather than saying x, little x minus big X, I used sub for subtract.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=4171" target="_blank">01:09:31.660</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the subtract from my broadcasting library.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=4174" target="_blank">01:09:34.900</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're curious, check out TorchUtils and you can see my broadcasting operations there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=4180" target="_blank">01:09:40.300</a></span> | <span class="t">But basically if you use those, you can see save for modification, it will do all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=4185" target="_blank">01:09:45.300</a></span> | <span class="t">broadcasting for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=4191" target="_blank">01:09:51.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So as you can see, this looks basically identical to the previous code, but it takes longer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=4202" target="_blank">01:10:02.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's not ideal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=4205" target="_blank">01:10:05.300</a></span> | <span class="t">One problem here is that I'm not using CUDA.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=4208" target="_blank">01:10:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So I could easily fix that by adding .Cuda to my x, but that made it slower still.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=4215" target="_blank">01:10:15.660</a></span> | <span class="t">The reason why is that all the work is being done in this for loop, and PyTorch doesn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=4222" target="_blank">01:10:22.180</a></span> | <span class="t">accelerate for loops.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=4224" target="_blank">01:10:24.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Each run through a for loop in PyTorch is basically calling a new CUDA kernel each time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=4232" target="_blank">01:10:32.980</a></span> | <span class="t">you're going through.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=4233" target="_blank">01:10:33.980</a></span> | <span class="t">It takes a certain amount of time to even launch a CUDA kernel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=4238" target="_blank">01:10:38.060</a></span> | <span class="t">When I'm saying CUDA kernel, this is a different usage of the word kernel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=4244" target="_blank">01:10:44.780</a></span> | <span class="t">In CUDA, kernel refers to a little piece of code that runs on the GPU.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=4250" target="_blank">01:10:50.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's launching a little GPU process every time through the for loop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=4254" target="_blank">01:10:54.980</a></span> | <span class="t">It takes quite a bit of time, and it's also having to copy data all over the place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=4259" target="_blank">01:10:59.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So what I then tried to do was to make it faster.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=4274" target="_blank">01:11:14.140</a></span> | <span class="t">The trick is to do it by minibatch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=4278" target="_blank">01:11:18.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So each time through the loop we don't want to do just one piece of data, but a minibatch</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=4286" target="_blank">01:11:26.500</a></span> | <span class="t">of data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=4287" target="_blank">01:11:27.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So here are the changes I made.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=4291" target="_blank">01:11:31.180</a></span> | <span class="t">The main one was that my for_i now jumps through one batch size at a time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=4299" target="_blank">01:11:39.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm going to go 0.123, but 0.1632.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=4307" target="_blank">01:11:47.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So I now need to create a slice which is from i to i plus batch size, unless we've gone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=4318" target="_blank">01:11:58.380</a></span> | <span class="t">past the end of the data, in which case it's just as far as hand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=4322" target="_blank">01:12:02.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is going to refer to the slice of data that we're interested in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=4328" target="_blank">01:12:08.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So what we can now do is say x with that slice to grab back all of the data in this minibatch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=4335" target="_blank">01:12:15.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And so then I had to create a special version of, I can't say subtract anymore, I need to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=4342" target="_blank">01:12:22.020</a></span> | <span class="t">think carefully about the broadcasting operations here.</span></div><div

32, I'm going to have 32 rows, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=4351" target="_blank">01:12:31.620</a></span> | <span class="t">then let's say n is 1000, it will be 1000 columns.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=4355" target="_blank">01:12:35.100</a></span> | <span class="t">That shows me how far away each thing in my batch is from every piece of data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=4360" target="_blank">01:12:40.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So when we do things a batch at a time, we're basically adding another axis to all of your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=4366" target="_blank">01:12:46.780</a></span> | <span class="t">tensors.</span></div><div

time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=4371" target="_blank">01:12:51.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And when we've been doing deep

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=4380" target="_blank">01:13:00.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So now we're writing our own GPU-accelerated algorithm.</span></div><div

target="_blank">01:13:48.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So I just have to be careful about where I add my unit axes, add it to the first axis</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=4432" target="_blank">01:13:52.780</a></span> | <span class="t">of one bit and the second axis of the other bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span

which rather than being 10 by 8, 10 sentences by 8 words, it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=5768"

target="_blank">01:38:06.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So each sentence was turned into an embedding, and they were length 20, that's what it was.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

target="_blank">01:39:40.940</a></span> | <span class="t">so we're going to end up with 4 dot products from each sentence of the story times the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

the code version.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=6187" target="_blank">01:43:07.100</a></span> | <span

you said the answer, was that really the embedding of the answer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=6196" target="_blank">01:43:16.660</a></span> | <span class="t">and then it has to get the reverse lookup?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=6198" target="_blank">01:43:18.860</a></span> | <span class="t">>> Yeah, it's the softmax of the answer, and then you have to do an

used the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=6255" target="_blank">01:44:15.100</a></span> | <span class="t">dot product again, but because of the fact that you've got a unit axis there, this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=6260" target="_blank">01:44:20.780</a></span> | <span class="t">actually just doing a very simple weighted average.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=6267" target="_blank">01:44:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, I've reshaped to get rid of the unit axis so that we can stick it

what this is effectively doing is it's basically saying, okay, how similar is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=6283" target="_blank">01:44:43.640</a></span> | <span class="t">query to each one of the sentences in the story?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=6288" target="_blank">01:44:48.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Use that to create a bunch of weights, and then these things here are basically the answers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=6293" target="_blank">01:44:53.140</a></span> | <span class="t">This is like, if story number 1 was where the answer was, then we're going to use this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=6298" target="_blank">01:44:58.860</a></span> | <span class="t">one, story number 2, 3, and 4, because there's a single linear layer at the very end, so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=6306" target="_blank">01:45:06.300</a></span> | <span class="t">it doesn't really get to do much computation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=6308" target="_blank">01:45:08.940</a></span> | <span class="t">It basically has to learn what the answer represented by each story

the original data set, the answer to every question is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=6332" target="_blank">01:45:32.500</a></span> |

that's why we just can have this incredibly simple final piece.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=6347" target="_blank">01:45:47.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is an interesting use of Keras, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=6351" target="_blank">01:45:51.780</a></span> | <span class="t">We've created a model which is in no possible way deep learning, but it's a bunch of

it has an output, so we can call it a model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZmJvmxfH6I&t=6367" target="_blank">01:46:07.300</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">01:46:13.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's kind of interesting how you can use Keras for things which don't really use any</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
