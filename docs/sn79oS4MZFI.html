I'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=57" target="_blank">00:00:57.060</a></span> | <span class="t">get into some details about that. It's not the only way to do it. And I'm hopeful that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=61" target="_blank">00:01:01.420</a></span> | <span class="t">somebody in this audience might look at this and be like, that's dumb.

And please raise your hand and tell me. But it's been really fun to build. I'm really,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=69" target="_blank">00:01:09.540</a></span> | <span class="t">really happy with the results and really excited to show you guys what it's all about. Okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=74" target="_blank">00:01:14.860</a></span> | <span class="t">so I will go into presentation mode. All right, here we go. Okay, first, just a very quick</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=85" target="_blank">00:01:25.180</a></span> | <span class="t">couple things about Stride. That's me if anybody needs my LinkedIn. But there's a couple other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=89" target="_blank">00:01:29.080</a></span> | <span class="t">places you can find that. We are a custom software consultancy. So what that means in practice</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.780</a></span> | <span class="t">is whatever you need, we'll build it. We have been doing a whole lot of AI stuff. This kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=101" target="_blank">00:01:41.540</a></span> | <span class="t">of falls into a few specific buckets. We use a lot of AI for code generation. We have a couple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.480</a></span> | <span class="t">of both products and services we've built to do things like unit test creation and maintenance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.580</a></span> | <span class="t">We've done a bunch of stuff around modernization of super old dumb code bases. You know, things like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=118" target="_blank">00:01:58.460</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, early 2000s era dot net is one of the things we specialize in. But what I'm going to show</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=124" target="_blank">00:02:04.280</a></span> | <span class="t">you today is really what we do around agent workflows. So the idea with, you know, this agent workflow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=129" target="_blank">00:02:09.140</a></span> | <span class="t">stuff is really just that, you know, it's something that could be done with traditional software. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.820</a></span> | <span class="t">this thing I'm going to show you was done with traditional software in its first run. But we have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=139" target="_blank">00:02:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">rebuilt it with an LLM at the core to make it more flexible, more capable, and, you know, ultimately,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">just a lot cooler. So really excited to show you guys more about that. So I'm going to start with a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.580</a></span> | <span class="t">little bit of grounding. I'm going to do a case study, which is very brief, but let's give you a sense of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=155" target="_blank">00:02:35.880</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of the problem we were trying to solve and how well I think we solved it. And then we'll go as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">deep as we all want to go in terms of how it works. Let me ask this up front. If you have questions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.380</a></span> | <span class="t">please raise your hand. I will try to notice and I'll try to get to you. There are some mics we could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.280</a></span> | <span class="t">pass around, but it probably is better for you to just shout it out. And then I'll repeat it into into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">my mic. And fundamentally, like, I have no idea if this is two hours worth of material.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.240</a></span> | <span class="t">It probably is. But, you know, please keep me honest. I'll talk about anything that is relevant</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">to this that you guys want to talk about. So the client here is Avila. So Avila Science is a women's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">health sort of institution, which is trying to help with the treatment of early pregnancy loss,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">otherwise usually known as miscarriage. What this is, though, is specifically a treatment where what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">happens is that, you know, you experience the event, you end up at the hospital or at a clinic. They send you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">home with medicine, right? The medicine is something that then you have to administer yourself at both a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">very traumatic time for you and your family, at a time when, you know, you need to keep track of when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">you are supposed to do things. It can be really challenging. There's other use cases beyond this in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">terms of chemotherapy, when people have trouble remembering what day it is, you know, let alone what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">they're supposed to be doing, right? You know, there's a variety of treatments that this is relevant for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">But Avila, in particular, has a system that they use to help people essentially administer these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">telemedicine regimes at home, right? And that system is text message-based. So everything here I'm going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to show you is essentially a text messaging-based engine with, you know, some core business logic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">that helps people stay on track. It answers their questions. It checks in on them, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">to make sure that the treatment went well. They still have a doctor relationship. This isn't replacing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the doctor. It is simply helping to get people through this treatment without a doctor's direct</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">support, at least a lot of the time. So a few disclaimers up front. First of all,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to show you a whole bunch of stuff here that is the client's actual code. Thank you so much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to my client. Thanks to Avila for being so open with this. It's really awesome. I'm really happy to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">able to show you as much as I'm going to show you. I have redacted a few things. I think what's left is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">still, you know, very much going to give you the character of the whole thing and an idea of how it works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Stride, we are custom software people, so we built custom software. I don't want to hide that part,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">right? It's possible to do a lot of this stuff with off-the-shelf tools, but there were some specific</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">requirements this client had that made it better, frankly, to build a lot of it custom. So we did,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">but we did the best we could to use, you know, big swaths of off-the-shelf, right? So you'll see a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">LangGraph, LangChain, LangSmith, you know, a bunch of other things like that, you know, very much in here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">because we do believe that that adds value and that it fundamentally makes the system a lot more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">explainable. Yeah, and, you know, there are also some constraints in terms of how it's hosted. This</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=316" target="_blank">00:05:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">is, you know, at least partially intersecting with patient data and various things like HIPAA and other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.280</a></span> | <span class="t">privacy requirements. The other thing, as I started with earlier, there's no right way to do this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">but this one does work for us, and I think you'll see as we walk through it some of the choices we made.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, there are definitely other ways we could have plugged the tools together. I think there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">definitely other ways we could have done this workflow. But we like how this came out. It</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">preserved some of the things that we really knew were important to our client and that kind of reserve,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, a lot of human judgment, you know, as opposed to sort of taking the elements entirely at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=348" target="_blank">00:05:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">their word. And this is very much a hybrid system with humans very much in the loop. And again, as I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">mentioned before, I would really love it if you guys looked at what we're doing here and said, "That's dumb."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Or have you thought about this, right? Because, A, you know, this is a project which we've only been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">working on for a few months, but, you know, things have already evolved. That's the way it is in AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm certain, and I know of a handful of things where, you know, we could replace</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=373" target="_blank">00:06:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">some of the choices we made with newer, more modern choices. And at the same time, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=377" target="_blank">00:06:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">there may be cases where, you know, I'm genuinely not using line graph right. I would love if someone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=382" target="_blank">00:06:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">raises their hand and tells me that. So please do have that in the back of your brains.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=385" target="_blank">00:06:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, cool. Really briefly on the stack that we used and on the team that we built. So the first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=392" target="_blank">00:06:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">thing, again, there's a lot of line chain in here. That is not because other frameworks can't do this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not because we couldn't build our own. The number one reason we went with this is because of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.280</a></span> | <span class="t">how easy it is to explain the system to other people, right? You know, if you look at, and I'll show you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=405" target="_blank">00:06:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">the line graph stuff in particular, it was straightforward to go into our client, you know, on a very early day</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=411" target="_blank">00:06:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">in the project and say, "Hey, this is how this thing works." You can see it goes from here to here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=414" target="_blank">00:06:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">There's loops here. Like this is where we're doing our, you know, our evaluation of the process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=419" target="_blank">00:06:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And here's where humans come in. It was very straightforward to do that. And I think it would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">have been a lot harder with something that was less visual and frankly, just less well orchestrated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=428" target="_blank">00:07:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're happy with this, right? There are some trade-offs to the line chain tools, but they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=432" target="_blank">00:07:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">mostly things we can live with. We are using Claude in the examples that I'm going to show you here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=438" target="_blank">00:07:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But the core code that we wrote works with Gemini, works with OpenAI. There are a few reasons that we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=443" target="_blank">00:07:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">think Claude is better for this. I'll get into that as we go. But, you know, there's, there's no model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=448" target="_blank">00:07:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">specific stuff really happening here. This is almost all just tool calling and MCP and, you know, other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=452" target="_blank">00:07:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">things that are pretty portable across most of the models. The stack overall is not just the LLM piece,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=460" target="_blank">00:07:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">right? So the LLM piece is Python and a line graph container. And then the other piece, right,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=465" target="_blank">00:07:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the piece that is a text message gateway and a database and a dashboard, which I'm going to show you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=469" target="_blank">00:07:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">pretty extensively, is Node and React and MongoDB and Twilio. And the whole thing is hosted in AWS.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=475" target="_blank">00:07:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">None of that has to be that way. That's just what we picked. You know, the main reason we picked AWS</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=480" target="_blank">00:08:00.640</a></span> | <span class="t">was for, you know, this has to support multiple different regions. We had to be able to deploy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=484" target="_blank">00:08:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">stuff, you know, entirely in Europe in a couple of cases, right? And so we needed to make sure that we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=488" target="_blank">00:08:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">had, you know, a decent set of, you know, cloud connections that we could work with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=492" target="_blank">00:08:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Evals. So I will show you the eval system that we built. We were not able to use, or at least I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=500" target="_blank">00:08:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">shouldn't say not able. We chose not to use the stuff entirely off the shelf from Langsmith. This</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=505" target="_blank">00:08:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">is partly because I didn't really want to be fully locked into them. I wanted the data to live there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=508" target="_blank">00:08:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I wanted to be able to see, you know, the current system in Langsmith. But I wanted to have something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=512" target="_blank">00:08:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">separate. And it turns out that some of what we had to do to make the evals, you know, fundamentally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=518" target="_blank">00:08:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">functional required a lot of pre-processing. So we built an external harness that essentially pulls</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=523" target="_blank">00:08:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">data out of Langsmith, processes it, and then runs things through PromptFu. And one of the reasons we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=528" target="_blank">00:08:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">picked PromptFu, if anyone's ever worked with it, they have a very flexible, they call it an LLM rubric.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=533" target="_blank">00:08:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this is an LLM as a judge. You basically describe how you want the eval to work. You feed the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=539" target="_blank">00:08:59.200</a></span> | <span class="t">data in and, you know, then it gives you a separate sort of visualization for that. So we ended up very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=543" target="_blank">00:09:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">happy with it. It's not the only way to do it at all. It was definitely, you know, the thing that fit best for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=548" target="_blank">00:09:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">for us. The team. So there were, and still are, two software engineers, one designer, and me. And I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=557" target="_blank">00:09:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">just, I would not call myself a software engineer. That's why I didn't include myself in that pool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=561" target="_blank">00:09:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">You can imagine there being two software engineers kind of maintaining the core</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=565" target="_blank">00:09:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">system that has the gateway and the dashboard and the text message stuff, right? And the database.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=570" target="_blank">00:09:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I maintained and built basically everything on the line graph side, right? So imagine this is being</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=577" target="_blank">00:09:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">two separate systems that talk to each other through a well-defined contract. And those two</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=582" target="_blank">00:09:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">software engineers understand roughly how my code works, but they really weren't maintaining it. You</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=586" target="_blank">00:09:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">know, it was almost entirely me with AI friends. And on that note, so everything I'm going to show</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=593" target="_blank">00:09:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">you is the code that I wrote. And I want to be very clear. I haven't been a real software engineer in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=598" target="_blank">00:09:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">a long time. I do have an engineering background. I spent seven years out of college, you know, hacking on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=601" target="_blank">00:10:01.440</a></span> | <span class="t">mobile apps. I took 15 years off and went to be a product person. And for about two years now, I've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=608" target="_blank">00:10:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">been back. But what that really means is just that, you know, essentially the stuff you're seeing, right,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=612" target="_blank">00:10:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">or the stuff I'm going to show you is mostly, you know, code that I wrote with Klein. That's my personal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=617" target="_blank">00:10:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">favorite. And so there's a bunch of options here. I like Klein best of all these options. You can use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=623" target="_blank">00:10:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">anything you want. The code isn't actually that complicated. Like, I would estimate, and I haven't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=627" target="_blank">00:10:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">actually counted, but there's probably a few thousand lines of Python, and there's a few</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=630" target="_blank">00:10:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">thousand lines of prompt. It's about equal, right? So I vibe-coded the Python, and I mostly hand-coded</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=637" target="_blank">00:10:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the prompt. Not 100%, right? But that's the way to think about the division of labor here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=642" target="_blank">00:10:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And for that matter, I mean, any of these tools can be great. The main reason I picked Klein was just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=647" target="_blank">00:10:47.040</a></span> | <span class="t">because, you know, we did not need, you know, sort of a hyper-optimized, you know, like $20 a month flow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=652" target="_blank">00:10:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, I've spent a lot more than $20 a month on tokens. That's just the way it is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=656" target="_blank">00:10:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, it was worth spending the money to just have sort of the best available</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=659" target="_blank">00:10:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">context of the model at any given point.

So I did mention, and this is in the Slack channel as well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=668" target="_blank">00:11:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">if you wanted to follow along with any of this, you could sort of do it by standing up your own</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=672" target="_blank">00:11:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">little LangGraph container with MCP.

That is literally what this is. And I like this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=719" target="_blank">00:11:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and I don't know if Chris is here, he was at the last event in New York.

And so I just like this framing of if you're capable, but you can't tell what it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=745" target="_blank">00:12:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">doing, it's dangerous.

We needed something that was able to do the job,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=773" target="_blank">00:12:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">clear about what it was doing, and that was steerable by humans in a really obvious way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=777" target="_blank">00:12:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So with that said, I'm going to start with a case study, right? And this is going to be a little weird</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=782" target="_blank">00:13:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">out of context, but hopefully this will give you a sense of what we were trying to solve for. So the idea</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=788" target="_blank">00:13:08.560</a></span> | <span class="t">here was that there's an existing product, right? So there was a product out there that was essentially</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=793" target="_blank">00:13:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">having humans manually push buttons on a console that would enable a text message to go out, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=800" target="_blank">00:13:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So you would read what the patient had said. They could say, I took my medicine at 3 p.m. They could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=805" target="_blank">00:13:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">say, I'm bleeding and I don't know what's going on. Like, am I okay? They could ask other sorts of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=809" target="_blank">00:13:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">questions about the treatment. And a human would have to go into a piece of software and click, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=814" target="_blank">00:13:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">a button that accurately reflected sort of where in the workflow somebody was, right? Because, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=819" target="_blank">00:13:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you can model a lot of this out. Imagine there being fantastically complicated flow charts of all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=824" target="_blank">00:13:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">things that can happen during a medical treatment. So the Avila team had built this, right? They realized,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=830" target="_blank">00:13:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">though, that essentially to scale the human team to be able to serve a lot more patients was prohibitive,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=834" target="_blank">00:13:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">right? They needed too many people clicking too many buttons. They also realized they couldn't really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=839" target="_blank">00:13:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">scale the system to new treatments, right? Which was something they wanted to do, that this isn't the only</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=842" target="_blank">00:14:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">regimen that you needed to support. They had other ones. And so the idea is that either they were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=847" target="_blank">00:14:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">going to rebuild the legacy software to be more flexible or they were going to essentially rebuild</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=852" target="_blank">00:14:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">it to use a different kind of decisioning at the core. And when they were looking at doing this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=857" target="_blank">00:14:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, LLMs had started, I think, become capable enough to handle this kind of work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=861" target="_blank">00:14:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So what we did, what we did is we built for them a workflow and essentially a piece of software that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=867" target="_blank">00:14:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">connects to it that enabled them to do new treatments flexibly, right? So this idea of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=872" target="_blank">00:14:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">essentially defining a blueprint and a knowledge base is the way that we thought about this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=875" target="_blank">00:14:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And essentially medically approved language, right? So one of the reasons that you had humans pressing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=880" target="_blank">00:14:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">buttons instead of typing text messages is because this is medical advice, right? You know, you are not,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=886" target="_blank">00:14:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you should not at least be giving medical advice that differs substantially from this approved language,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=891" target="_blank">00:14:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">right? There's reasons that this stuff is said the way that it's said, you know, and doctors have,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=895" target="_blank">00:14:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, similar limitations. We also built a self-evaluation function, which I'll go into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=901" target="_blank">00:15:01.200</a></span> | <span class="t">tremendously in a second. We wanted to make sure that we caught essentially situations that were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=906" target="_blank">00:15:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">complicated and surfaced them for humans, right? Because we wanted to have a human in the loop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=910" target="_blank">00:15:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But we were trying to raise up the existing folks who were really just operating the system and clicking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=915" target="_blank">00:15:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">all those buttons to be supervisors of agents that were doing that instead, right? That really was the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=920" target="_blank">00:15:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">model that we were working with at its core. So I have a question over here. Yeah?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=923" target="_blank">00:15:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">You may have said it. Were these operators medically trained?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=926" target="_blank">00:15:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So the question is, are these operators medically trained?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=929" target="_blank">00:15:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">There is a physician's assistant who essentially leads the operations team. So the way that you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=934" target="_blank">00:15:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">think about it is that she would be escalated to whenever something came up that was outside of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=939" target="_blank">00:15:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">blueprint, right? So if you had a situation where they're just like, "I'm really not sure what to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=942" target="_blank">00:15:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">here." A slack goes out to that channel with a physician's assistant in it who would then give</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=946" target="_blank">00:15:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">medical advice. So again, this is one of the reasons it was hard to scale, right? Because you only had one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=951" target="_blank">00:15:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">of those people on this particular team. Sure. And so to sort of jump a little bit ahead, but hopefully</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=958" target="_blank">00:15:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you'll see why this is in a minute, this roughly, and again, we're still doing the measurement, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=963" target="_blank">00:16:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">We're still trying to figure out exactly what capacity has gone up to. We think it's something like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=968" target="_blank">00:16:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">10x. We think that they can serve as roughly 10x more people with this new approach.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=972" target="_blank">00:16:12.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, it's not free, right? We have to build the software. We have to pay for the tokens. Tokens can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=977" target="_blank">00:16:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">get expensive. But if you think about just the scale issues involved in scaling up a team of people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=982" target="_blank">00:16:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and, again, in building the software to be more flexible for more treatments, we think this capacity</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=986" target="_blank">00:16:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">increase is very much warranted and very much the thing that solves the problem. And you can do new</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=993" target="_blank">00:16:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">treatments and new workflows without writing more code, right? That was the single biggest thing about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=997" target="_blank">00:16:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">this. And you'll see what we're doing here is largely Google Docs, right? And, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1000" target="_blank">00:16:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">we have some more advanced techniques to manage those things and inversion them over time. But we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1005" target="_blank">00:16:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">talking about being able to support whole new treatments and whole new workflows without going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1008" target="_blank">00:16:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">back to the code, right? That's hugely valuable to these guys. Question?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1012" target="_blank">00:16:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">You mentioned velocity increasing like 10x. Is there any measuring about quality of care?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1018" target="_blank">00:16:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So the question was velocity increases. Is there a quality of care measure? Short answer is it's early,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1024" target="_blank">00:17:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">right? I mean, this is still a system that's, you know, in progress. It is being used with real people,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1028" target="_blank">00:17:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">but it's still very, very much early on that. The way that I think we're looking at it is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1032" target="_blank">00:17:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">there would be some combination of the operators being the ultimate arbiter, right? They're going to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1036" target="_blank">00:17:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">able to see these conversations and determine as they approve them, you know, as they review them, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1040" target="_blank">00:17:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">hey, is this mostly getting it right? And then there are sort of existing kind of CSAT, you know, level of measures that you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1045" target="_blank">00:17:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">apply to the people who are on the other end of the treatment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1048" target="_blank">00:17:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So 10x sounds a little low. Is that because the operators are still approving everything that comes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1052" target="_blank">00:17:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">out right now? So they're not approving everything that comes out. And I agree, the 10x is kind of,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1056" target="_blank">00:17:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">it's an order of magnitude, not a precise measure, right? But I think in this case,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1060" target="_blank">00:17:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you'll see a couple of cases that require approval, right? And sort of why. But the approval also is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1065" target="_blank">00:17:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">very quick, right? So the argument is that you probably only see one of every 10 exchanges. And when you see it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1070" target="_blank">00:17:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">it takes you roughly as long as it took the last time to just push the button, right? Which was the thing they were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1075" target="_blank">00:17:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">already doing. So that's kind of why we've benchmarked it there. All right. So let's get into it a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1082" target="_blank">00:18:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">bit. So this is just a snapshot of what this looks like in line graph. I'll show you the real thing in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1087" target="_blank">00:18:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">just a minute. And it's actually evolved a tiny bit since I took this picture. But really, what we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1091" target="_blank">00:18:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">talking about here is the people who operate the system today, we call them operations associates.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1096" target="_blank">00:18:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So what this is really doing is introducing a virtual operations associate. That operations associate is going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1102" target="_blank">00:18:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">assess the state of essentially a conversation, interaction with a patient, determine what the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1108" target="_blank">00:18:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">best response is, both in terms of the text message you might send, the questions you might ask, the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1113" target="_blank">00:18:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">actions you might take. Because some of this is about maintaining essentially a state for that patient,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1118" target="_blank">00:18:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">right? You know, you are at any given point trying to figure out, when is this person taking their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1123" target="_blank">00:18:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">medicine? When did they take their medicine? You know, what medicine do they have? What time is it for them,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1128" target="_blank">00:18:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">which is actually more important than you may think? All of this has to be maintained, right,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1132" target="_blank">00:18:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">by the system. And so the virtual lawyer is doing all that work. And then it's passing essentially its</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1137" target="_blank">00:18:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">proposal, right? It basically comes up with, I think this is what we should do. And it passes it to an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1142" target="_blank">00:19:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">evaluator agent. So there's a live LLM as a judge process, separate from the evals, which we'll get to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1148" target="_blank">00:19:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But the live LLM as a judge is essentially saying, okay, given this thing that just happened,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1153" target="_blank">00:19:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">here is our assessment of A, you know, how right the LLM thinks it is. That's frankly very challenging.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1159" target="_blank">00:19:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">LLMs are very hard to convince that they're wrong about anything. But it also is looking at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1164" target="_blank">00:19:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">complexity, right? So even if the LLM believes it's made all the right decisions, you can have it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1167" target="_blank">00:19:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">impartially say, well, I changed this and I changed that and I'm scheduling a bunch of messages. That's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1171" target="_blank">00:19:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">complicated. Maybe a human should look at this, right? So that's actually a lot easier to implement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1177" target="_blank">00:19:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And both of these things are calling tools. The tools are a mix of MCP. And so there's sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1184" target="_blank">00:19:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">two versions of MCP here. I'm going to show you one, which is basically just looking at local files,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1188" target="_blank">00:19:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">just so I can show you all the stuff in my environment. But there's also MCP going across</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1192" target="_blank">00:19:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the wire to the larger software system and keeping all this stuff in the database, right? So there's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1196" target="_blank">00:19:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">mix of those two things. And the rest of the tools are about maintaining state. Because as a conversation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1203" target="_blank">00:20:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">is happening, the LLM needs to know, you know, essentially, well, I made this update and that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1208" target="_blank">00:20:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">update. And here's the current state that I'm working with. And it has to be able to sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1211" target="_blank">00:20:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">manipulate these things in real time. That is not MCP. That's not going to a database anywhere. Like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1215" target="_blank">00:20:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">this is happening entirely in sort of the live thread. And then once it finishes, then it gets pushed out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1220" target="_blank">00:20:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and essentially saved away. Okay? Again, we'll get into a lot more of that. I did want to spend a minute on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1227" target="_blank">00:20:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">this on the system architecture, right? And so I realized it was a little small. Go ahead.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1230" target="_blank">00:20:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">When you mentioned about the system state, I heard before that LNGraph has a context,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1236" target="_blank">00:20:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">or some of the state object building the LNGraph itself. You mentioned that you use tools. Are you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1241" target="_blank">00:20:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">talking about separate things or the same thing? The question was about how the state is managed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1245" target="_blank">00:20:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">in LNGraph. So short answer is, this may be one of the things where I'm not doing it optimally,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1250" target="_blank">00:20:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">by the way. But with LNGraph, there is a state object that we load, essentially, when the request comes in,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1256" target="_blank">00:20:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">from a JSON blob, right? We keep it alive inside the graph run. It is not directly accessible to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1263" target="_blank">00:21:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">model, right? At least not the way that we're doing it, right? So you'll see, actually, as we get into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1268" target="_blank">00:21:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">this, that you can see all the state coming in in LNGsmith, right? I can see, like, hey, this is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1272" target="_blank">00:21:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">whole thing that was loaded. I still have to repeat that in my first message to Claude, right? It doesn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1277" target="_blank">00:21:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">actually show up, you know, in the same place. And then I call the functions. That state will evolve in terms of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1282" target="_blank">00:21:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">what's inside the graph run. And then when it outputs, it's the Python code, not the model,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1287" target="_blank">00:21:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">which essentially takes all that state and then serializes it and sends it out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1291" target="_blank">00:21:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So you'll see how it works. But like, that's generally one of the things that I'm not sure I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1295" target="_blank">00:21:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">doing right. Anything else? Yep? Yeah, somewhat related. You have one node for that virtual</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1301" target="_blank">00:21:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and it's going back and forth to tools, right? And updating the state. Yeah. I'm assuming the reason</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1305" target="_blank">00:21:45.840</a></span> | <span class="t">we have it in some form hard-coded out that business logic more into separate nodes is precisely because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1311" target="_blank">00:21:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">you'll lose the workflow diagnostic agent for the next time. Is that sort of the notion there?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1316" target="_blank">00:21:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So the question is why, essentially, the virtual lay is one agent and not, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1321" target="_blank">00:22:01.520</a></span> | <span class="t">a sort of a pre-coded sort of version of here's how I administer the specific treatment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1325" target="_blank">00:22:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, the reason I think we kept it simple is because we did not want to be super</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1329" target="_blank">00:22:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">treatment specific and how the architecture worked. But you could imagine doing, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1334" target="_blank">00:22:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">a set of slightly smaller, you know, better tuned agents that were, you know, kind of taking care</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1338" target="_blank">00:22:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">of elements of the task that was still pretty generic. The main reason I think it's not optimal to do that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1344" target="_blank">00:22:24.240</a></span> | <span class="t">is caching. And this is another question where, you know, I think I'm doing this right, but there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1348" target="_blank">00:22:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">are a lot of variations here. Caching the entire message stream is easier with either one agent or with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1355" target="_blank">00:22:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of one agent doing most of the work. We're using Claude. Claude has very explicit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1359" target="_blank">00:22:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">caching mechanisms. And every time I switch the system prompt, I think the cache blows up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1365" target="_blank">00:22:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And so fundamentally changing the agent identity does that. So that was one, that's one reason we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1370" target="_blank">00:22:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">chose that. It's certainly not, you know, a hard and fast forever choice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1373" target="_blank">00:22:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">What's the duration of the, like, care? Are we talking like months? Or like how many messages?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1384" target="_blank">00:23:04.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So this use case, the early pregnancy loss, it tends to be a treatment which takes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1390" target="_blank">00:23:10.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I think, three days end-to-end to administer most of the time. And then there's a check-in after that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1394" target="_blank">00:23:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">right? So imagine that probably within a week, the entire interaction with that patient is done,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1398" target="_blank">00:23:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">unless they come back and just have questions later on, right? You know, there are some variants of this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1402" target="_blank">00:23:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">where you take a pregnancy test after six weeks, right? And so that's all fine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1406" target="_blank">00:23:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The message history is preserved, but the computation that happens to generate each message is not,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1412" target="_blank">00:23:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">or at least not in sort of the state that we save. So like, you know, the most complicated conversation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1418" target="_blank">00:23:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I've seen was something like 150 texts. It's a lot in terms of, you know, a human keeping it in their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1423" target="_blank">00:23:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">brain. It's not that bad for an LLM, right? So, but it's that level.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1428" target="_blank">00:23:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. So again, just to point out where the lines are here, right? So I kind of got off on a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1434" target="_blank">00:23:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">tangent. The top box is what we're going to be looking at here today, right? It's really a Python</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1438" target="_blank">00:23:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">container with access locally to these blueprints, this knowledge base, right? We are also then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1444" target="_blank">00:24:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">maintaining some stuff over across the wire in this blue container. That's really where the dashboard I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1448" target="_blank">00:24:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">going to show you is. It's where the text message gateway is. And it is where we're going to be moving,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1452" target="_blank">00:24:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I think, a lot of that context, right? Although the blueprints, like all that stuff really should live</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1455" target="_blank">00:24:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of in the more durable software container. Right now it lives, you know, close to the Python.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1459" target="_blank">00:24:19.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So let's get into it. So the first thing I'll do here is just to show you kind of at a high</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1467" target="_blank">00:24:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">level what the software looks like. So this again is the console, the dashboard, right? The thing that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1474" target="_blank">00:24:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the operations associates, the humans are going to be looking at. And I'll show a couple things here just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1479" target="_blank">00:24:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">to give you the sort of baseline, right? So the first thing here is this needs attention. So the current</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1483" target="_blank">00:24:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">system basically has this needs attention flashing all the time. Every time a text message comes in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1488" target="_blank">00:24:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">from any patient, this thing is going off, right? You know, so there's, you know, hundreds of patients,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1492" target="_blank">00:24:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">thousands of pages in the system at any time. So, you know, this needs attention used to be something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1497" target="_blank">00:24:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that multiple people were having to stare at constantly, right? Just to make sure that they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1501" target="_blank">00:25:01.200</a></span> | <span class="t">caught everything so that they could get out messages in a reasonable time. Now, needs attention is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1506" target="_blank">00:25:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">really, you know, just sort of one thing at a time, right? And if I look here at the conversations,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1509" target="_blank">00:25:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">there we go, you can see that the top one here actually needs a response. I'll get to that in a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1513" target="_blank">00:25:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">minute. But at any given point, right, this is my test environment, you know, I've got a handful of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1517" target="_blank">00:25:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">these conversations kind of already, already queued up. What I can see here, if I click into these things,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1522" target="_blank">00:25:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">is essentially, I'll just go back to the beginning here for the whole message history, and I'm going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1526" target="_blank">00:25:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">toggle this rationale on. What you're seeing is the entire conversation, is that readable? Let me see if I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1532" target="_blank">00:25:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">blow it up a little bit. Is that a little better? Okay. So the idea here is the agent is named Ava, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1540" target="_blank">00:25:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the personality that people are interacting with. This language is all coming out of these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1546" target="_blank">00:25:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">blueprints, right, that I'll show you. And so this first message is just an initial message sent by the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1550" target="_blank">00:25:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">system, essentially, just to kick things off. So imagine someone is, they have a package of medicine in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1554" target="_blank">00:25:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">their hand, they scan a QR code. They put in their phone number, they get this text message, right? And then they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1559" target="_blank">00:25:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">start talking. So you can see here, the kinds of things a patient is going to say are, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1564" target="_blank">00:26:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">freeform text, right? You know, this, I mean, they could say yes in any number of ways. The old system</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1569" target="_blank">00:26:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">used to have literally different buttons for yes, like, yes, I have the medicine. Yes, I heard you. I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1575" target="_blank">00:26:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">mean, it's like, there's all sorts of variants, right? And because you did have to respond differently</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1579" target="_blank">00:26:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">depending on what those things were. What we're able to do here is really just take, you know, these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1584" target="_blank">00:26:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">freeform answers, interpret them, and then essentially provide a rationale for why you would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1589" target="_blank">00:26:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">say a given thing at a given time, right? So this is equivalent to if you were doing this with a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1593" target="_blank">00:26:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">human, and you asked the human, well, why did you say this? The LLM can provide this kind of context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1597" target="_blank">00:26:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is Claude looking at the history here, and I'll show you what this looks like in Langsmith,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1601" target="_blank">00:26:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">which will make it a lot more obvious, and then saying, okay, here's the next thing that I should</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1606" target="_blank">00:26:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">say, and my confidence that I should say it is 100%, right? It's usually very confident, right? But the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1612" target="_blank">00:26:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">point is, this whole process is largely going to go along in an automated fashion, right? You don't usually need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1617" target="_blank">00:26:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">humans involved because this is a very straightforward thing. They have their medicine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1620" target="_blank">00:27:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">The next thing I need to know, and this is a very interesting part of this treatment,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1624" target="_blank">00:27:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I need to know what time it is. These are text messages. We don't know anything about these people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1628" target="_blank">00:27:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">For a variety of reasons, it's kind of good that we don't know much about them, right? We don't want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1631" target="_blank">00:27:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">to have to deal with all of the stuff around provider confidentiality and patient data, right? So one of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1636" target="_blank">00:27:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">things that we need if we're going to go through this longitudinal treatment is to figure out what time it is for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1640" target="_blank">00:27:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">them, and then essentially pull out that data and figure out what their local time is, right? So in this case,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1644" target="_blank">00:27:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I was in Eastern time when I answered these questions. This is all me doing this, you know, from my laptop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1649" target="_blank">00:27:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I tell it what time it is. It calculates an offset from UTC and says, well, I guess you're in Eastern time, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1654" target="_blank">00:27:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And then it sets this over here and it says, all right, from now on, I know that my patient is in Eastern time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1658" target="_blank">00:27:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">unless they tell me otherwise. And they could come back and tell you otherwise, right? That's something the old system</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1663" target="_blank">00:27:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">really didn't have a good way to do. But if the patient comes back and says, I'm on a plane,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1667" target="_blank">00:27:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">it's actually seven for me, we just update the time zone and move on, right? This is a very flexible system that way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1672" target="_blank">00:27:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Then we get into this over here and we say, okay, now that I know what time it is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1677" target="_blank">00:27:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to ask them if they've started their treatment, right? And, you know, there is a blueprint,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1681" target="_blank">00:28:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">right, which we'll get to, you know, that essentially just has, you know, the medicine that they're going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1685" target="_blank">00:28:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">take in a very specific way to take it, right? The protocol. The patient says, well, no, I want to take</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1691" target="_blank">00:28:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">it soon. You know, the Ava says, cool, I'll text you when we're ready. And then it gives, you know, a regimen,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1695" target="_blank">00:28:15.600</a></span> | <span class="t">which in this case, this is an SVG that we are stapling times and dates on top of, right? So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1701" target="_blank">00:28:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, fairly straightforward. We're doing this in software. The LLM is not doing it. The LLM is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1704" target="_blank">00:28:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">actually just passing along the instructions. You know, it says, send the step one image and provide,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1710" target="_blank">00:28:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, like this date and this time, and we substitute the rest of it in. And this goes out as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1713" target="_blank">00:28:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">an MMS, right? So this is a text message. And so we provide this. The patient, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1720" target="_blank">00:28:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">says, you know, in this case, we're talking, you know, again, this is all the LLM reasoning through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1723" target="_blank">00:28:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">this, right? You know, I am sending this immediately because it's actually within sort of the 35 minute</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1729" target="_blank">00:28:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">window that you've told me that I have to send these things. This is all business logic that the LLM is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1733" target="_blank">00:28:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">interpreting pretty much on the fly. And then I have these reminders, right? I didn't get back to it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1739" target="_blank">00:28:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is an important part. It sent me this thing and it thought that I was going to take it at 5:45.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1743" target="_blank">00:29:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I didn't text it back, right? This is partly because I was maintaining the system myself and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1747" target="_blank">00:29:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I forgot. So I had to come back in the next day and catch up. So it sent me an automated reminder</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1751" target="_blank">00:29:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">because it scheduled one when it sent the first message. So part of this is the LLM only gets</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1755" target="_blank">00:29:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">called when the patient says anything. So if they don't, you know, you have to make sure that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1760" target="_blank">00:29:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">stay engaged, right? You don't do this overly. Like we don't try to bother people beyond one or two</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1763" target="_blank">00:29:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">reminders. It's their treatment. But this bump sort of functionality was really important to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1768" target="_blank">00:29:28.560</a></span> | <span class="t">client, right? So we built it in. So you can see here, I came back the next day and I said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1773" target="_blank">00:29:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">yep, sorry, I did take it. You know, Ava confirms that I completed step one. And what it does is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1777" target="_blank">00:29:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">it sets this thing called an anchor, right? And it says, okay, you know, the patient was going to take</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1782" target="_blank">00:29:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">it at 5:45. They confirmed that they did. And so now, you know, I can refer back to this. I know that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1786" target="_blank">00:29:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">this happened, right? And if the patient had then said, oh, no, I screwed up. I actually haven't taken</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1790" target="_blank">00:29:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">it. I'll take it today. We just changed the anchor. We update everything, right? So this is a system</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1794" target="_blank">00:29:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that humans used to have to do. If a patient came back and said, I didn't take my medicine,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1799" target="_blank">00:29:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, a human has to go in and manually update all the times and all the scheduled messages. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1803" target="_blank">00:30:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">it was, it was a big pain in the butt. Um, yeah, please.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1816" target="_blank">00:30:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Not exactly. Um, the way that we do state and I'll, I'll spend a lot of time on this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1821" target="_blank">00:30:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">but the way that we do state is really just that with any given message from the patient,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1825" target="_blank">00:30:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">right? This entire system only kicks off when the patient sends a message. Um, what we do is we say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1831" target="_blank">00:30:31.040</a></span> | <span class="t">all right, given this state, what is the best response? And that response could be,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1835" target="_blank">00:30:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I changed some of these anchors. I update their treatment phase. I scheduled a bunch of messages.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1840" target="_blank">00:30:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">All that state is preserved so that the next time they write in, then, you know, we have that state</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1844" target="_blank">00:30:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">to go on. Um, but again, we're not checking, right? There's no polling going on in the system</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1849" target="_blank">00:30:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">where we're saying after three hours, did the patient text me back? We don't do that. We depend</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1853" target="_blank">00:30:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">on the scheduled messages essentially just to nudge the patient. Um, if they choose to not say anything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1858" target="_blank">00:30:58.560</a></span> | <span class="t">for three days and they come back after three days, we just pick up where we left off. Um, again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1862" target="_blank">00:31:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">this is a choice. This is the way the client wants it. It's, it's intended to be low enough touch that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1867" target="_blank">00:31:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">it doesn't bother people, but high enough touch that it doesn't lose track. Sure. Um, I'll pause here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1872" target="_blank">00:31:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">actually. Any other questions so far? Um, I, I realize I'm going through a lot. Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1875" target="_blank">00:31:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Do your anchors have to be sequential or can your user come in at any point in the treatment plan?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1882" target="_blank">00:31:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">They can.

Um, or like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1886" target="_blank">00:31:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">do you have to go through these one step at a time?

Like you could, you could kind of skip ahead, but this automatically does it. You know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1912" target="_blank">00:31:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">part of the instructions are don't ask the patient a question they've already answered,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1916" target="_blank">00:31:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">like period. Right? But that's annoying. Don't do that.

So you'll,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1940" target="_blank">00:32:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you'll see, um, when we get into the, the, the actual back and forth with Claude, um, in Langsmith,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1946" target="_blank">00:32:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you as a human can see kind of where it starts, right?

Again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1953" target="_blank">00:32:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">that's just one dot I've never made it managed to connect with line graph, right?

But then the LLM has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1960" target="_blank">00:32:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that in its window.

You know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=1969" target="_blank">00:32:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">it can go back and retrieve it.

We make it so that we basically throw everything out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2025" target="_blank">00:33:45.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and restart when the patient gets back to us in part because blueprints could change, right?

What was your second question though?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2144" target="_blank">00:35:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, is the patient going off a typical journey, uh, how do you detect and intercept?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2150" target="_blank">00:35:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. So the question is if the patient goes off track. So we, we have this idea of a blueprint,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2154" target="_blank">00:35:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">but then there are plenty of cases where the blueprint may, um, you know, not fully answer whatever the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2159" target="_blank">00:35:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">patient is, is, is bringing up. Um, like one example is the blueprint is very much about asking questions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2165" target="_blank">00:36:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">right? So you will say, have you taken your medicine yet? When do you plan to take your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2169" target="_blank">00:36:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">medicine? The patient will say, my stomach hurts. Okay. So yes, your stomach hurts. You didn't answer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2175" target="_blank">00:36:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the question. What we do is the patient typically will get an answer to their question. So one of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2179" target="_blank">00:36:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">principles is always answer the patient's question, right? We don't ever want to leave them hanging,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2184" target="_blank">00:36:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but then ask yours again. So the idea is that at any given point, we can answer anything that they need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2189" target="_blank">00:36:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and as gently as we can, we'll try to pull them back onto the blueprint so that we understand where they are in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2193" target="_blank">00:36:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the treatment. Um, it's an, an exact science, but, uh, is there a way to detect if, uh, someone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2200" target="_blank">00:36:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">actually was off track? Well, the LLM does that effectively by knowing that it's supposed to keep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2205" target="_blank">00:36:45.840</a></span> | <span class="t">people on the blueprint, but having an escape hatch for the knowledge base, essentially what we call</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2209" target="_blank">00:36:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">it, right? Triage or knowledge base, you know, whatever you want to call it. Um, so, you know, we,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2213" target="_blank">00:36:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">we don't have an explicit bit sort of flipped in the system that will say this patient is off track.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2219" target="_blank">00:36:59.120</a></span> | <span class="t">We just kind of know roughly where they are in the treatment. And if they want to answer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2222" target="_blank">00:37:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">if they want to ask a bunch of questions, we'll, we'll just answer them until they, they are satisfied.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2225" target="_blank">00:37:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.

Otherwise,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2386" target="_blank">00:39:46.560</a></span> | <span class="t">you're just going to pair it whatever particular snippet the RAG happened to bring back, and then the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2390" target="_blank">00:39:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">logical has to be in the RAG.

This is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2411" target="_blank">00:40:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">thing that will happen, or did happen in this treatment. Sorry, that was the question about the anchors. Yeah?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2416" target="_blank">00:40:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So when you, you mentioned that you, like, compressed the conversation, and you keep track of all that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2422" target="_blank">00:40:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is that anchors, or is that another part of that? No, so the, the state is essentially,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2426" target="_blank">00:40:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, we, we call it, for reasons that only an engineer could love, we call it a schedule document,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2431" target="_blank">00:40:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">right? The idea is that for any given patient, there is a schedule that they're on, and the document</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2436" target="_blank">00:40:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">snapshots their current state at any given point, right? And it's a version database, so we could go back</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2440" target="_blank">00:40:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">in time, and we could see what their document was three days ago. But it has, at any given point,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2444" target="_blank">00:40:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the messages that have been exchanged, any unsent messages that are scheduled,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2448" target="_blank">00:40:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and enough state about their treatment to fill out this view. Yeah? Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2453" target="_blank">00:40:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So in this case, all of this stuff is locked away, right? So I mean, just to go back to this diagram</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2464" target="_blank">00:41:04.640</a></span> | <span class="t">for a second, this entire thing is all behind, you know, AWS's VPC, right? So like, there is no external</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2471" target="_blank">00:41:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">access to the LLM period, the only things it can talk to are essentially its own documents,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2475" target="_blank">00:41:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, in, in local files, and to the, the blue box. So, you know, there, there certainly are vectors,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2481" target="_blank">00:41:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">but the vectors would be through the text messages, right? Not really through anything else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2486" target="_blank">00:41:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Yeah. Oh, I'm sorry, a bunch of people. You first.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2488" target="_blank">00:41:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Just a question regarding, I guess, it's two boulders. One is like, how are you assessing the confidence rate from the model's response, and the second is how are you safeguarding against prompt injection for malicious behavior?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2500" target="_blank">00:41:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Well, so, the question was about prompt injection and, and generally sort of steering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2504" target="_blank">00:41:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, the, the, the basic answer is just that you could definitely try to trick the model by sending weird texts, right? And we do that as part of our, you know, sort of internal red teaming. Like we have the entire team of operations associates who have been spending, you know, weeks and months trying to trick this thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2520" target="_blank">00:42:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and granted, they're not trying to trick it from a reveal proprietary personal medical data, you know, I mean, there, there's things like that. We also obscure a lot of that medical data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2528" target="_blank">00:42:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So the things that get, get to the yellow box do not include phone numbers. They do not include anything other than the patient's identified first name. Um, so there's a lot of, there's a lot of that data that's kept only in the blue, which is a lot easier to, to defend against.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2540" target="_blank">00:42:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so yeah, we, we, we, we very much do obscure the, the, the patient. We don't obscure the treatment, right? The treatment is fully visible to the LM.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2548" target="_blank">00:42:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, cool. Yep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2550" target="_blank">00:42:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You mentioned human in the loop. How did you do the evaluation of asking the correct answer in the loop?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2557" target="_blank">00:42:37.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yep. Uh, hold that thought. I will get to that very, very shortly. Um, we're back there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2561" target="_blank">00:42:41.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, sorry. It's just a question about unclear instructions. Um, so, uh, when, when the situation is ambiguous,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2577" target="_blank">00:42:57.320</a></span> | <span class="t">the LLM is told to look at the blueprint and pick the best possible answer. Now, if you don't believe the, the LMU, if you don't believe the, the answer is perfect, um, you should say so.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2587" target="_blank">00:43:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. In the rationale. So if I go back over here, this idea of the rationale, if there is uncertainty on the models, you know, point of view, it can say, well, I picked this blueprint response, but I'm not sure that it's right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2596" target="_blank">00:43:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">In practice is not great at doing that. Right. But that is the idea. And then the evaluator is also going to look at this and say, well, did you actually pick either the exact blueprint response word for word?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2606" target="_blank">00:43:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Did you adapt it? You know, does this seem right to you? Like we're trying to at least give a little bit of a layer before we get to humans.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2612" target="_blank">00:43:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And then hopefully we can trap situations like that and say, well, this is a complicated situation. A human should, should take a look. Um, it is not an exact science though.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2619" target="_blank">00:43:39.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Like that's generally just true with this stuff. Sorry. You in the back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2622" target="_blank">00:43:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm curious about the scale. Like, uh, like, what's the load of how many batches of the .</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2633" target="_blank">00:43:53.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Um, so the question was just about load and scale. So, uh, look, the really short answer is that this, this system exists, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2638" target="_blank">00:43:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">There's an existing version of it that is humans pushing buttons. Um, that scale is, you know, again, let's say thousands, not millions of patients.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2645" target="_blank">00:44:05.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, this opens up the possibility of doing more treatments, right? That's how we would get sort of additional patient scale.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2651" target="_blank">00:44:11.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You can also sell this to new hospitals, new clinics, things like that. Um, so part of this is to get the scale to be larger.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2657" target="_blank">00:44:17.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, we have not run into scale issues with, you know, just the, the conversations with Claude, you know, the software that we're building would scale much, much larger than thousands of users, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2665" target="_blank">00:44:25.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, the, the text message gateway might actually be the, the biggest bottleneck. So it's, it's honestly, it's a problem we want to have. Um, go ahead.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2672" target="_blank">00:44:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, um, you keep saying Claude, did you guys select the LLMs because it was what the client had access to?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2678" target="_blank">00:44:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Or was there like a specific reason why you're going with 3.5 or whatever you're using?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2682" target="_blank">00:44:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Uh, so the question was of model selection. Um, when we started this, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2686" target="_blank">00:44:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think, you know, let, let's assume that we kicked this project off, you know, late last year, early this year, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2691" target="_blank">00:44:51.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, we had to make a choice and our main criteria were it had to be a steerable model that we felt pretty good about, you know, transparency wise. Um, you know, one example, just, just to give you a specific one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2700" target="_blank">00:45:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, four mini is pretty good at this workflow, but it won't show its reasoning. Um, like, I mean, that's just one example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2707" target="_blank">00:45:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And like, it's not a deal breaker. Like we can still see the rationales. Like there's some pieces of it, but I like being able to go into Langsmith and seeing the whole conversation, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2713" target="_blank">00:45:13.320</a></span> | <span class="t">That, that really helps me out. Um, we needed, you know, again, flexible hosting, but I mean, all the clouds kind of do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2718" target="_blank">00:45:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Frankly, we didn't want to deal with Microsoft and we kind of preferred AWS to Google. That was kind of how we got there, but you know, you can do this anywhere.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2727" target="_blank">00:45:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It really was just, we had to pick a horse and we largely have not regretted it. And in part, because we built enough flexibility where if I want to switch, I still can.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2734" target="_blank">00:45:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So my question is about, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2741" target="_blank">00:45:41.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2743" target="_blank">00:45:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, so the question is about sensitivity, uh, of data through the text carriers and also about, uh, using the data to learn. Um, I'll do the learning first. Um, we don't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2765" target="_blank">00:46:05.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We, we do not take any of the responses and do anything to the models other than when we see situations that we as humans have evaluated and found wanting, um, we can tweak the prompting and the guidelines, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2777" target="_blank">00:46:17.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But we are not putting this in any sort of durable form. Like ultimately, you know, we believe the right model here is the provider interaction. If there's a provider involved, that sticks around, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2786" target="_blank">00:46:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">The provider knows that you interact with the system. They can have, you know, whatever records they need. Um, otherwise, you know, we forget about you when your treatment is done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2792" target="_blank">00:46:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We think it's better that way. Um, on the, on the, the sensitivity question, yes, there is sensitivity involved. And at the same time, again, there's prior art with these products, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2802" target="_blank">00:46:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">There are existing systems which essentially take, you know, text messages in and provide medical advice. Um, we're just trying to stay within the guidelines of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2810" target="_blank">00:46:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, that's one reason why we don't want the LLM actually to have any data that is not explicitly required just to do decisioning, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2817" target="_blank">00:46:57.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It doesn't need anything beyond that to, to make a good decision. Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2823" target="_blank">00:47:03.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2824" target="_blank">00:47:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So every response is a hundred percent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2826" target="_blank">00:47:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh-huh.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2827" target="_blank">00:47:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Is it determining that that's a hundred percent?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2829" target="_blank">00:47:09.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And then what are the situations where it's not ?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2832" target="_blank">00:47:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yep. Um, sorry. Hold that thought too. Cause I will get to that in just a second. Um, let me move on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2836" target="_blank">00:47:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, please like bring these questions back up. I just want to get a little bit further so we can see some other, some other cool things about this. Um, I'm going to move on from this flow just because you can imagine that this is going over a period of days, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2845" target="_blank">00:47:25.320</a></span> | <span class="t">There's another step here, step two, where there's, you know, more medicine being dispersed. Um, and then, you know, ultimately we're going to get to the end, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2852" target="_blank">00:47:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, essentially, did you complete this? And then, okay, great. You know, this is what's going to happen to you. You know, you're going to see some bleeding. Um, and then we have this check in, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2860" target="_blank">00:47:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So imagine that this now is, you know, a full, let's say three or four days later, right? After the, the treatment has begun. Um, you know, we check in, you know, the patient gets back to them or not, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2867" target="_blank">00:47:47.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Remember, some of these patients will just be like, I'm done. I don't really need to talk to this thing anymore. But if they do, right, we continue with the treatment. We don't bother them. We just let them sort of resume where they left off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2878" target="_blank">00:47:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, we have these rationales, you know, we have these questions. And then what I want to do here is just to show you briefly, um, sorry, I got to zoom back out so I get the full phone number, um, what it would look like to interact.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2888" target="_blank">00:48:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So if I go here into my sandbox, um, imagine that normally this would be a text message. Um, so, you know, I would be doing this on my phone. Um, but here, you know, I can answer this question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2898" target="_blank">00:48:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">If I had any pregnancy systems before, have they decreased? It's like, yes, uh, they have decreased.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2907" target="_blank">00:48:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so I post this message. Now what's going to happen from here is thinking. So none of this is instant. And so now what I want to show you is what this looks like in Langsmith.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2916" target="_blank">00:48:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, um, you can see here a couple of things. Um, one is that this, this is now spinning. Um, so this thing that I just asked it is now in active processing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2924" target="_blank">00:48:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll show you what it looks like when we're done. Um, but I will give you just a brief look at, um, I think this is probably a useful one here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2931" target="_blank">00:48:51.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, what this actually looks like in terms of processing the state. Um, so I'll blow this up a little bit and make it a bit bigger.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2939" target="_blank">00:48:59.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, um, what you can imagine, this is using Sonnet 4, um, is that every time a message comes in from a page,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2946" target="_blank">00:49:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">a patient, this is what I get. Okay? I get this description of, you know, everything that's going on here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2952" target="_blank">00:49:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I can see this is an Avela patient. I can see the thread that we're currently executing, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2957" target="_blank">00:49:17.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Because you may need to resume these threads if you need to give feedback. Um, I have this idea of I'm in the three day check-in phase.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2962" target="_blank">00:49:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's the blueprint that I'm going to read. Um, and then I have a couple of things. I have these anchors, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2967" target="_blank">00:49:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Which, you know, you could see, I think this is exactly what you saw before, um, you know, in that same patient.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2971" target="_blank">00:49:31.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, these are all defined as, you know, actually a mix of UTC and Eastern timestamps. Um, that's one of the problems that's hard to eradicate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2979" target="_blank">00:49:39.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, getting LLMs to deal well with time is really tough. Um, but then I have this entire message queue, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2983" target="_blank">00:49:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is the compressed state of the conversation to date, right? This does not include every message that Claude sent itself while it was thinking, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2992" target="_blank">00:49:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">That part is contained in these individual Langsmith threads. I could go back and I could look at this if I needed it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=2996" target="_blank">00:49:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, but what I'm doing is I'm compressing and basically saying all I really care about is the actual messages that went back and forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3001" target="_blank">00:50:01.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I want these rationales because I want to be able to review them, right? That helps me understand the decision that's going on here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3006" target="_blank">00:50:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, you know, I want these confidence scores so I can go back and look, you know, what did it think at any given point?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3011" target="_blank">00:50:11.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, I'll show you one where the confidence was low, but these things can go on a little ways, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3015" target="_blank">00:50:15.320</a></span> | <span class="t">This is probably, I don't know, 20, 25 messages, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3018" target="_blank">00:50:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">All of this goes in as initial context in the window, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3021" target="_blank">00:50:21.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you had 150 messages, all 150 of them are going to potentially go in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3025" target="_blank">00:50:25.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Now we do have a function where you can optionally set it to compress and say, well, just show me the last 50, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3031" target="_blank">00:50:31.320</a></span> | <span class="t">If I need to request more, I can do that. There's a way to do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3033" target="_blank">00:50:33.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, but I don't need to have the entire thing in the window.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3036" target="_blank">00:50:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so I get down here. This is the last message from the patient, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3039" target="_blank">00:50:39.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So the question was, did you notice blood clots? I said, yes, a few, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3043" target="_blank">00:50:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, that was, that was what I, as a patient said, Claude is now going to start processing this thing, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3048" target="_blank">00:50:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So imagine, you know, this all being basically pasted into, you know, a Claude window and then having it go through this process and call tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3055" target="_blank">00:50:55.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So it starts by looking at directories that it's allowed to view. Again, this is a version where it's got the blueprints kind of all local and it's, it's talking to them this way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3063" target="_blank">00:51:03.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We have another version where it talks via MCP over to the blue box, right? The larger system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3067" target="_blank">00:51:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so it figures out what directory it has. It reads these basic ones because these need to be read in all cases.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3073" target="_blank">00:51:13.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So these guidelines, right? The idea of how do you do your job, right? The idea of what the confidence framework looks like, the overview of the treatment, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3080" target="_blank">00:51:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, those sorts of things. We read those up front. None of these is very large, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3083" target="_blank">00:51:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you read all this stuff, you know, it, it comes into the, the window. Um, and then, you know, essentially it reads those descriptions and it says, well, I was told as part of this that I have to read the current blueprint for this current phase, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3094" target="_blank">00:51:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So I read that file individually. So a bunch of these early calls are just about setting up the context. This is not the only way to do it, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3100" target="_blank">00:51:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, this, this is the way that we've chosen to do it again. We chose not to do rag for a couple of, you know, reasons around.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3105" target="_blank">00:51:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We just did not think we could get good enough results. And because this is honestly easier to interpret, right? You can sort of tell what it's doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3111" target="_blank">00:51:51.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, I get to the blueprint, the blueprint, and you will, we'll see more of these examples in a second, but the blueprint is basically this kind of structured bulleted list, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3119" target="_blank">00:51:59.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's all the stuff that you might need to say to somebody, right? And you know, here's what you do when, you know, the user says a certain thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3126" target="_blank">00:52:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">This isn't actually that prescriptive. It's just structured, right? This isn't an if then statement, right? It's kind of like that, but it's not an actual if then statement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3135" target="_blank">00:52:15.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So like this format, you know, is one that we iterated on and got to a point where we actually get really good results. Um, but you know, it wasn't a hundred percent obvious.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3143" target="_blank">00:52:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">This is the way to do it up front. Um, you know, we started with charts. Um, and so now you get to this point where now you can see, okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3150" target="_blank">00:52:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">now I got to look at these, you know, uh, conversations. I got to figure out what's been going on here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3154" target="_blank">00:52:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you can see here, even though I passed in the state, it has a function to list messages.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3158" target="_blank">00:52:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it basically says, all right, well, now that I sort of know what's going on, let me see the last five messages, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3162" target="_blank">00:52:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can see here, it's going to start sending, you know, a bunch of these in. Um, and so it does that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3167" target="_blank">00:52:47.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It looks to see if there's anything scheduled. There's not. Right. And so now it says, all right, this is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3172" target="_blank">00:52:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">this is sort of the point where Claude does its little explaining thing. I understand what's going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3177" target="_blank">00:52:57.320</a></span> | <span class="t">The patient's in the three day check-in phase. I already asked about bleeding and cramping.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3181" target="_blank">00:53:01.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I asked about blood clots and the patient, you know, basically just said, yes, they have blood clots.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3185" target="_blank">00:53:05.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I'm just going to keep on going. Right. And it goes to the next question about pregnancy systems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3190" target="_blank">00:53:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">This message comes directly from the blueprint. Okay. And I'll show you in a Google doc form in a second what that looks like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3196" target="_blank">00:53:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so it schedules it. It says, you should send this message, you know, as soon as you want to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3201" target="_blank">00:53:21.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we get over to this evaluator flow. Right. And the evaluator says, all right,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3205" target="_blank">00:53:25.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to look at this situation. I'm going to look at everything that requires confidence scoring. Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3209" target="_blank">00:53:29.320</a></span> | <span class="t">That new message is the only thing. It's, it's the, the only thing that just happened.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3212" target="_blank">00:53:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and I'm going to send it immediately. This is just a, a timestamp for immediately.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3216" target="_blank">00:53:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, I then get this kind of report. Right. And the way that we set up our framework, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3222" target="_blank">00:53:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and I'll show it in code a little bit clearer is, you know, do we know what the user is saying?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3227" target="_blank">00:53:47.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Do we know what to say? And do we think that we did a good job?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3230" target="_blank">00:53:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, this is a tough one. Right. Um, generally speaking, the LLM, you know, says at all times, yes, I know what I'm doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3236" target="_blank">00:53:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And you know, like buzz off. Um, but what I can also do is I can say, all right, then there's a bunch of cases in which if I set an anchor,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3244" target="_blank">00:54:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">if I updated the patient's data, like maybe I changed their time zone offset, maybe I changed their name. Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3249" target="_blank">00:54:09.320</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a weird thing that, you know, if it happened, you'd probably want a human to look at. Um, do I, am I sending multiple messages?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3254" target="_blank">00:54:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Do I send it, am I sending duplicate messages accidentally? Do I have reminders for things that have already happened?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3259" target="_blank">00:54:19.320</a></span> | <span class="t">All of those things would deduct from the score and cause a human to get involved. Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3264" target="_blank">00:54:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">That that's part of how we do this is to combine. Does the model think it's okay? Right. That's this top part.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3269" target="_blank">00:54:29.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And then overall, is there a weird circumstance that I should try to catch? Right. And then I should try to, to, to show people, uh, to show a human for review.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3276" target="_blank">00:54:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, in this case, nothing came up. I update the confidence. It's confidence of a hundred percent. Um, and then essentially the virtual OA, you know, as, as a final thing, it's very hard to get Claude not to summarize itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3286" target="_blank">00:54:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It does. Um, it basically just says, here's everything I did. I'm good. And then if you go down here to the bottom, this is the output state.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3293" target="_blank">00:54:53.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So this output state says, well, I have a hundred percent confidence. Again, it's version of it that I did the right thing. I, you know, here's my anchors. Here's my messages.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3302" target="_blank">00:55:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And here's the unsent message that I'm, I'm now going to send. And because it's a hundred percent confidence, it just goes out. Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3308" target="_blank">00:55:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It goes back to the text message gateway and it just goes out. Um, that is a risk, right? You know, if you want it to be perfectly safe, you have a human review, all of these things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3316" target="_blank">00:55:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We don't want to do that because we're trying to scale, right? So we are comfortable in general with things that are, are, you know, coming back with a hundred percent confidence that we just send those messages out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3324" target="_blank">00:55:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, question back there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3326" target="_blank">00:55:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So when you're doing that evaluation stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3329" target="_blank">00:55:29.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3330" target="_blank">00:55:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Are you, like, bucketing those situations somehow, like tracking what the agent is having trouble, like, determining in any way to, like, create that, like, later on?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3339" target="_blank">00:55:39.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, yeah. So the question is just, uh, how do we determine sort of the, the, the, the situations that might have confidence issues?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3345" target="_blank">00:55:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, it is very hand tuned and geared to this evaluation team, like basically the virtual OA team that exists now as, as humans.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3352" target="_blank">00:55:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, we will review, you know, in sort of spot checks, you know, a bunch of situations just to kind of see like, hey, is, is, does it seem like it's okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3359" target="_blank">00:55:59.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, when the, when a patient writes back, cause there are cases where a patient will write back and say, you got that wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3364" target="_blank">00:56:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, that's not the time I said, like, you know, I, I'm actually taking it now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3367" target="_blank">00:56:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, the confidence system is pretty good at picking up that that happened and basically saying, all right, even if I think I'm confident something's wrong, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3374" target="_blank">00:56:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, a human should take a look at this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3376" target="_blank">00:56:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, but I mean, the, the answer is it's, it's more art than science.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3379" target="_blank">00:56:19.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not something that we are perfect at even now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3381" target="_blank">00:56:21.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And because we want to scale, we've chosen to say, look, the, the worst that happens is essentially something weird happens and a couple of text messages go back and forth that are just wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3390" target="_blank">00:56:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Usually the human will get involved and say, that doesn't sound right to me, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3394" target="_blank">00:56:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not, it's not a case where the patient is in danger.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3396" target="_blank">00:56:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, you know, if they say, well, I'm having these symptoms, you're not helping me, like a human will step in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3401" target="_blank">00:56:41.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Like that's, that's something we're pretty good at flagging.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3403" target="_blank">00:56:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3404" target="_blank">00:56:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3405" target="_blank">00:56:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I guess, like, are you, like, tracking that somehow?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3407" target="_blank">00:56:47.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's like, if, like, if he says, like, okay, I'm having this admirable bleeding, I'm taking the medication.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3412" target="_blank">00:56:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3413" target="_blank">00:56:53.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you know how many times that happened?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3414" target="_blank">00:56:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And do you, like, go back and, like, address that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3417" target="_blank">00:56:57.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3418" target="_blank">00:56:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3419" target="_blank">00:56:59.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, so the, the short answer is, um, we can look at interactions that ultimately are scored as low confidence, and then we can trace back from there, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3426" target="_blank">00:57:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So a lot of what we're doing is when something gets flagged and a human is like, well, there's something weird here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3431" target="_blank">00:57:11.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, you know, we share those things internally, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3433" target="_blank">00:57:13.320</a></span> | <span class="t">The, the Slack channel that I was talking about before where they talked to the physician's assistant, that's largely been repurposed to people saying, hey, this behavior is off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3439" target="_blank">00:57:19.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, can you go take a look?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3440" target="_blank">00:57:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And that ends up essentially in my queue as, you know, I got to go check my evals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3444" target="_blank">00:57:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I got to see if there's something I can do to catch this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3446" target="_blank">00:57:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And maybe it's a matter of changing the behavior.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3448" target="_blank">00:57:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, but so it's usually, it, when we, when we know there's an issue, we can backtrack.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3451" target="_blank">00:57:31.320</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the short answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3452" target="_blank">00:57:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, over here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3453" target="_blank">00:57:33.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm curious, uh, humans also make mistakes?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3457" target="_blank">00:57:37.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3458" target="_blank">00:57:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you have any data from, like, before in the system of, like, the percent or error rate for human response versus AI?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3465" target="_blank">00:57:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3466" target="_blank">00:57:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, so the question was about human versus AI error response from prior data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3469" target="_blank">00:57:49.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, yeah, great question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3470" target="_blank">00:57:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And, and yes, the answer is we do have that data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3473" target="_blank">00:57:53.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's one of the reasons that the client is as comfortable as they are with letting an LLM kind of run amok, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3478" target="_blank">00:57:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Is the idea that humans do make mistakes now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3480" target="_blank">00:58:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And when they get escalated, you know, it's something where you can look back and be like, oh yeah, that was a little bit off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3484" target="_blank">00:58:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You, you correct it and you move on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3485" target="_blank">00:58:05.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, this is kind of unique in that, again, it, it needs to be, you know, precisely worded.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3490" target="_blank">00:58:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, one of the biggest risks is just that you give sort of off-label medical advice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3493" target="_blank">00:58:13.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But if the idea is that, like, oh, you misunderstood and you have to go back and correct yourself, that's okay, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3498" target="_blank">00:58:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It's, it's, it's, that's not a fatal error, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3500" target="_blank">00:58:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3501" target="_blank">00:58:21.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So a lot of it is that, you know, we think that we can get better use out of our humans by reviewing these situations, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3506" target="_blank">00:58:26.320</a></span> | <span

running for a while.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3516" target="_blank">00:58:36.320</a></span> | <span

about, um, fine-tuning a model with de-identified, uh, messages?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3522"

target="_blank">00:58:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, like, running it back through?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3525" target="_blank">00:58:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I mean, the, the, the, so the question was about, um, have we thought about fine-tuning?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3530" target="_blank">00:58:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, we have already seen two major model releases in the time we've been working on this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3535" target="_blank">00:58:55.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, we, we, we generally don't think that fine-tuning is a great use of our, of our dollars.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3539" target="_blank">00:58:59.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, it, it, it, obviously, it could be cheaper.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3542" target="_blank">00:59:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We can, I mean, one, one example is, um, we tried, you know, at one point to use Haiku.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3546" target="_blank">00:59:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and, you know, Haiku is not even that much cheaper.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3548" target="_blank">00:59:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It's maybe a third the cost, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3550" target="_blank">00:59:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, we, we got to a point where we made our blueprints better, in part, because, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3555" target="_blank">00:59:15.320</a></span> | <span class="t">we'd sort of had some shortcuts where we just didn't have to be as, as precise with Sonnet, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3558" target="_blank">00:59:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, we had to be more precise with Haiku, and then it worked.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3561" target="_blank">00:59:21.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Haiku did not get the time stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3563" target="_blank">00:59:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Haiku was terrible at figuring out what times it needed to sort of put on things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3567" target="_blank">00:59:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, the, the kind of thing we would have to do there, like, it either just kind of requires a smarter model,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3571" target="_blank">00:59:31.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and there were smarter models from multiple people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3573" target="_blank">00:59:33.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, '04 mini really is both, you know, I mean, it's, it costs a little bit less than Haiku, I think, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3578" target="_blank">00:59:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And it, it was every bit as smart as Sonnet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3580" target="_blank">00:59:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We chose not to go with it, in part, because it wasn't as transparent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3583" target="_blank">00:59:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, but so, in, in general, we don't believe that fine-tuning is warranted, because we think the models are just gonna keep getting better and cheaper,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3589" target="_blank">00:59:49.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and that we, you know, we'll be able to just kind of switch wholesale, as opposed to having fine-tuned something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3593" target="_blank">00:59:53.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, when you're going through that, is there, you had this, like, chattiness with the model, or it was describing its actions and then calling tools?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3601" target="_blank">01:00:01.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3602" target="_blank">01:00:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Is that, like, was that an intentional choice?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3603" target="_blank">01:00:03.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Because I feel like you could just skip that and just do standard outputs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3606" target="_blank">01:00:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It, well, so, yes, it was, it was kind of intentional choice, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3610" target="_blank">01:00:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">This is partly that we, we already get the, the rationales and sort of the general, you know, explanation of its actions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3616" target="_blank">01:00:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, but there are times where you want to be like, look, why did it do this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3620" target="_blank">01:00:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, if it's thinking out loud, it's a lot easier to catch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3623" target="_blank">01:00:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so, yes, it, it's possible that we could eradicate some of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3626" target="_blank">01:00:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We don't really think the juice is worth the squeeze.</span></div><div

going to suffer a second miscarriage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3633" target="_blank">01:00:33.320</a></span> | <span class="t">How does the current structure set up so that you have a new anchor point to see, like, this person is using this medication all over?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3640" target="_blank">01:00:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3641" target="_blank">01:00:41.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, great question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3642" target="_blank">01:00:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, uh, questions about, essentially, multiple treatments are coming back again after, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3645" target="_blank">01:00:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">having gone through a treatment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3646" target="_blank">01:00:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, there are a couple ways to do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3648" target="_blank">01:00:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So one is that, um, you know, again, depending on how you get there, if you scan a QR code,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3653" target="_blank">01:00:53.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that can start kind of a new activation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3655" target="_blank">01:00:55.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So we can know that you're coming in a second time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3657" target="_blank">01:00:57.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, but people will write back after, you know, two months and say, I have a question, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3662" target="_blank">01:01:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And, and so we either can just reactivate that conversation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3665" target="_blank">01:01:05.320</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3669" target="_blank">01:01:09.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's a few different ways to kind of disambiguate, you know, what somebody is actually up to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3672" target="_blank">01:01:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But that notion of,

the VOA is supposed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=3832" target="_blank">01:03:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to do,

know, we keep on talking forever in text because that's messy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4229" target="_blank">01:10:29.320</a></span> | <span class="t">There are a bunch of points which I'm not going to be able to demo here, which basically just say, yeah, I'm sorry, I can't answer that question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4234" target="_blank">01:10:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Call 9-1-1, go to your

that is usually where it goes from there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4240" target="_blank">01:10:40.320</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">01:10:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Like why do you use laying ground for that as well?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4248" target="_blank">01:10:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, it's a great question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4249" target="_blank">01:10:49.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So honestly, part of it is just that we needed to have something that the patient, or not the patients, the client was actually comfortable maintaining, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4256" target="_blank">01:10:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Because remember, part of it is that we do not want this in code, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4259" target="_blank">01:10:59.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We don't want this to be something where you can only maintain it if you have a technical person.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4262" target="_blank">01:11:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the problem they had before, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4264" target="_blank">01:11:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so just to jump over for a second, I'll show you what this kind of looks like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4267" target="_blank">01:11:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is essentially the thing that the client is maintaining.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4271" target="_blank">01:11:11.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'll blow this up a little bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4272" target="_blank">01:11:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I realize that is small.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4274" target="_blank">01:11:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But the idea here is that we're using terms and, you know, we'll see a little bit more of this in the code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4280" target="_blank">01:11:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We're using terms that are defined in the framework.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4283" target="_blank">01:11:23.320</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4287" target="_blank">01:11:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, we have the conversation of these messages.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4290" target="_blank">01:11:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We always tell the LLM why this is important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4292" target="_blank">01:11:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">If we just had this detail and we just said this is the message you send, I don't think it would perform as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4297" target="_blank">01:11:37.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It's much more helpful to actually give the LLM justification for why it would say something because then it makes better decisions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4302" target="_blank">01:11:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the many quirks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4303" target="_blank">01:11:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Go ahead.</span></div><div

the next part, but how complicated and how simple do you do the if statements kind of logic in there?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4315" target="_blank">01:11:55.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you get lost?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4316" target="_blank">01:11:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Or if you have any issues that actually got lost in the .</span></div><div

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4320" target="_blank">01:12:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4321" target="_blank">01:12:01.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So the question was just about, you know, essentially why do we have this framework and why is it maybe not more declarative, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4326" target="_blank">01:12:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">In terms of like specifically if then and that sort of thing, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4329" target="_blank">01:12:09.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Actually, I use similar with a different framework with Yama index.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4334" target="_blank">01:12:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4335" target="_blank">01:12:15.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4337" target="_blank">01:12:17.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4338" target="_blank">01:12:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So I couldn't go like very complicated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4341" target="_blank">01:12:21.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4342" target="_blank">01:12:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">A lot of nested if then.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4343" target="_blank">01:12:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It's gotta be like one, two levels max, otherwise we got lost.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4346" target="_blank">01:12:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4347" target="_blank">01:12:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4348" target="_blank">01:12:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So the answer is just about, again, how do you define these things as clearly but, you know, maybe not complexly as possible, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4360" target="_blank">01:12:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So this framework tends to work where you're really just saying, look, I'm giving you this approved language and I'm trying to give you in the bold statements here, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4370" target="_blank">01:12:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Primarily, I'm trying to give you a sense of, you know, what the conditioning really is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4373" target="_blank">01:12:53.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But part of the reason that we did it this way is because, you know, if the patient writes back after this thing and he says, you know, yes, I have the medication and I took the pills and my stomach hurts and I'm confused, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4383" target="_blank">01:13:03.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, it could be all these things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4385" target="_blank">01:13:05.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We wouldn't want to represent something like that in a flow chart.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4388" target="_blank">01:13:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">What we really want to do is just say, look, this is the outline of the thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4391" target="_blank">01:13:11.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You can see it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4392" target="_blank">01:13:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, if you need to jump ahead, jump ahead and don't ask the patient questions they've already answered.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4395" target="_blank">01:13:15.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It just turns out that this framework really does work pretty well for letting the LLM do that sort of thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4400" target="_blank">01:13:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It's I know that's kind of a magic answer, but it's pretty good at it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4404" target="_blank">01:13:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, no, I mean, well, yeah, Claude mostly nails it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4407" target="_blank">01:13:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Most of them do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4408" target="_blank">01:13:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4409" target="_blank">01:13:29.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Does including the instructions like quantifiably improve the response quality?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4416" target="_blank">01:13:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Sorry, what do you mean by including the instructions?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4418" target="_blank">01:13:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Including the reasoning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4419" target="_blank">01:13:39.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, the reasoning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4420" target="_blank">01:13:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So the question was, does including the reasoning help with the response quality?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4424" target="_blank">01:13:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it does, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4425" target="_blank">01:13:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, this is one of these things where we started also by borrowing from human documentation, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4430" target="_blank">01:13:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So this was a process that was originally explained to humans who were going to push the buttons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4434" target="_blank">01:13:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we took a combination of flow charts that existed to explain the flow of the treatment and these kinds of, you know, this is the message that you should send in these situations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4442" target="_blank">01:14:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And this was kind of the hybrid output of those two things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4445" target="_blank">01:14:05.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So I wouldn't say we did aggressive testing on is it really better or is it just that, you know, this is good enough.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4451" target="_blank">01:14:11.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It's more that like we started with this framework based on the human materials we had.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4454" target="_blank">01:14:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Kind of a follow up question to that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4455" target="_blank">01:14:15.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4456" target="_blank">01:14:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Did you find any sacrifices that you had to make in kind of maintaining this document as human readable versus LLM?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4467" target="_blank">01:14:27.320</a></span> | <span

changing the approval?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4527" target="_blank">01:15:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So at the

right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4554" target="_blank">01:15:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">That is one of these cases

just try to find this quickly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4578" target="_blank">01:16:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And you'll get to a point where the human says, all right, yeah, here it is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4582" target="_blank">01:16:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So we get feedback from, yep, from the human OA.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4586" target="_blank">01:16:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">This is essentially what happens whenever I push that button and I say give feedback, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4591" target="_blank">01:16:31.320</a></span> | <span class="t">The human OA has

target="_blank">01:16:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Actually, no, I just updated that one in place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4605" target="_blank">01:16:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We rescored it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4606" target="_blank">01:16:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">One thing we've said is that we do not change the confidence score on something that a human reviewed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4611" target="_blank">01:16:51.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We leave it where it was, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4612" target="_blank">01:16:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We let them review it again, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4614" target="_blank">01:16:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so in all these cases, this is also a much quicker, you know, simpler sort of operation, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4618" target="_blank">01:16:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you can see the evaluator here is basically like, yep, that message is fine,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4621" target="_blank">01:17:01.320</a></span> | <span class="t">but we're not going to do anything, you know, really to change the overall score.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4626" target="_blank">01:17:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, that's the kind of thing that, you know, we can look at afterwards, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4630" target="_blank">01:17:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But we are not at this point at least, you know, really trying to feed that back into the model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4633" target="_blank">01:17:13.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It's really just for the blueprints.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4635" target="_blank">01:17:15.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Just to get a sense of your metrics, a lot of these are, you know, over-admitted, and it says about, you know, a couple hundred thousand tokens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4642" target="_blank">01:17:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">How do you kind of look at it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4643" target="_blank">01:17:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Like a necessary evil, the time it takes, the cost, or just a testing environment?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4648" target="_blank">01:17:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">No, no, I mean, it is a necessary evil.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4650" target="_blank">01:17:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And actually, just to point it out, these costs I don't believe are correct.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4655" target="_blank">01:17:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the shortcomings of Langsmith, and I think they've admitted this in various forms, is they don't really take into account the caching.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4660" target="_blank">01:17:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So these costs should be lower than what you see here, but fundamentally, yeah, these are expensive operations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4666" target="_blank">01:17:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, we could change some of them at the potential cost of higher error rates, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4671" target="_blank">01:17:51.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Like we could try to cache more and have you inherit threads in progress, and it would be faster, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4676" target="_blank">01:17:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Because you've already loaded everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4677" target="_blank">01:17:57.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It would be, you know, potentially you're not reloading any context, and so, you know, you're spending maybe less on tokens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4682" target="_blank">01:18:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And you just might have a higher error rate, and that's, you know, a thing we are trading off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4688" target="_blank">01:18:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Is there some kind of knowledge base that your model is taking to, like, a pivot, depending on the medicine that your patient is taking?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4699" target="_blank">01:18:19.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Because maybe the side effects are different, and the question should be different?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4703" target="_blank">01:18:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so the question is just in terms of the knowledge bases.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4707" target="_blank">01:18:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So let me actually jump over and just show this really quick.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4709" target="_blank">01:18:29.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So I mentioned these blueprints.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4710" target="_blank">01:18:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll jump over now, really, into just what the implementation looks like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4714" target="_blank">01:18:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can see over here, you know, this idea of for Avila, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4718" target="_blank">01:18:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We have a handful of documents here that are, again, exported into Markdown.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

of this, you know, sort of framework data, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4733" target="_blank">01:18:53.320</a></span> | <span class="t">The idea of defining.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4734" target="_blank">01:18:54.320</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">01:19:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We're doing this as part of the context window in part because we do want this to be really flexible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4745" target="_blank">01:19:05.320</a></span> | <span class="t">If you want to change the terms, you should be able to do that, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4747" target="_blank">01:19:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We don't want the treatments to

this stuff exists in part just to lay the groundwork.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4757" target="_blank">01:19:17.320</a></span> |

target="_blank">01:19:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you can see here, like, again, these documents are all referring to each other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

who you are,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4916" target="_blank">01:21:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">here's who this other guy

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4954" target="_blank">01:22:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's an example which might speak to your question actually over here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4956" target="_blank">01:22:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, the idea of, do we want the LLM to use its world knowledge to figure out that when I'm talking about an antibiotic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4963" target="_blank">01:22:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and I give a specific antibiotic that it applies to the whole class of them?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

| <span class="t">So we do have a handful of places where we ask it, use your own judgment, but refer to, you know, the knowledge base</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4980" target="_blank">01:23:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and the blueprints for your baseline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

deductions, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4986" target="_blank">01:23:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And the deductions here are specifically things like, you know, you should deduct from the overall score, not the individual messages, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=4994" target="_blank">01:23:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Because an individual message could be like, yeah, this is exactly from the

target="_blank">01:23:21.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what we're trying to do is explain that such that it can, again, score the overall interaction in a way that surfaces it for human review.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5009" target="_blank">01:23:29.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so I'm going to move on to the guidelines because, again, there's just a lot more in here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5013"

target="_blank">01:25:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we are caching explicitly, you know, the multiple turns of the messages such that, you know, each operation is, you know, I think the average operation with just sort of the baseline stuff is maybe 10 to 15,000 tokens, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5114"

something that we believe is fundamentally, you know, pretty good at handling these, you know, generic situations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5187" target="_blank">01:26:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And when we find edge cases, we just modify these prompts.</span></div><div

this division is, you know, roughly correct for keeping it generic so that it's, you know, it handles a bunch of different treatments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5201" target="_blank">01:26:41.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And it handles the situations that we see across treatments pretty well, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5205" target="_blank">01:26:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You will have cases where

target="_blank">01:27:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is very long.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5228" target="_blank">01:27:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Have you ever seen like a cloud is for a very specific, or sometimes there's one equal or basically, but it has a very long

and then, you know, the .</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5241" target="_blank">01:27:21.320</a></span> | <span

length.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5247" target="_blank">01:27:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, not to dismiss that out of hand, in cloud terms, this isn't actually that long, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5252" target="_blank">01:27:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, this is, like I said, I think on average, 15,000 tokens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5255" target="_blank">01:27:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It still leaves a lot of the window, you know, behind, right?</span></div><div

crazy behaviors until we start doing multiple turns, like multiple conversations in one thread, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5267" target="_blank">01:27:47.320</a></span> | <span class="t">That's where it starts to blow up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5269" target="_blank">01:27:49.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So we just genuinely have not gotten to a point where we're like, my guidelines are too long.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5273" target="_blank">01:27:53.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, the guidelines could be a little shorter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5275" target="_blank">01:27:55.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think we have optimized them in various places over time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5278" target="_blank">01:27:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, we've crammed this into a box where we really can sort of process one situation all in one gulp without really feeling any pain.</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5288" target="_blank">01:28:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Any examples on tools that you have used?</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5294" target="_blank">01:28:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So I can share a little bit of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5295" target="_blank">01:28:15.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So let me go down here to the tools code itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5298" target="_blank">01:28:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So one thing to note, this is a hybrid.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5300" target="_blank">01:28:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think I mentioned this really earlier on about there is some stuff coming from an MCP gateway, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5305" target="_blank">01:28:25.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So in this case, you know, I'm loading from files.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5307" target="_blank">01:28:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just the file system MCP, again, all localized to our VPC.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5310" target="_blank">01:28:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's nothing crazy going on there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5312" target="_blank">01:28:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But I could instead load from, you know, my database, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5315" target="_blank">01:28:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I could choose to have that be the place where you interact.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5317" target="_blank">01:28:37.320</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a bunch of other tools, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5319" target="_blank">01:28:39.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, this actually is where probably most of the code in my app actually is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5324" target="_blank">01:28:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">The list of tools is essentially down here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5328" target="_blank">01:28:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can see it's things that enable interacting with the state, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5331" target="_blank">01:28:51.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So all of these functions that are looking at anchors and messages and confidence and the treatment and patient data, all of that stuff is local to my graph run.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5359" target="_blank">01:29:19.320</a></span> | <span class="t">For anybody who has programmed with line graph, the whole idea behind this is that at any given point, you're able to pass back a message.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5366" target="_blank">01:29:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And this particular thing is just an error message.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5368" target="_blank">01:29:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But like, you know, you're able to pass back a message and a place to go, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5371" target="_blank">01:29:31.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can say, here's the response.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5374" target="_blank">01:29:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And by the way, I know that the evaluator asked for this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5376" target="_blank">01:29:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So go back to the evaluator.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5377" target="_blank">01:29:37.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You can actually get around some of the graph routing this way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5379" target="_blank">01:29:39.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we've definitely, you know, tried to work this into both the MCP tools and the state tools that we have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5384" target="_blank">01:29:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5385" target="_blank">01:29:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5396" target="_blank">01:29:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So the question is about how do we improve the prompt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5398" target="_blank">01:29:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So it was really a fusion of...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5401" target="_blank">01:30:01.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We were able to go from essentially the physician's assistant who had the most experience with tricking things, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5407" target="_blank">01:30:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">For what's coming up with tricky situations, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5409" target="_blank">01:30:09.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So we were able to test a lot of the edges really just with her, you know, having her pretend to be the patient.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5413" target="_blank">01:30:13.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We then scaled up to the full team of operations associates who, you know, then tried to trick it at a higher level, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5418" target="_blank">01:30:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, we're putting out things that they'd seen from patients themselves, you know, trying to sort of, you know, get to these complicated cases.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5425" target="_blank">01:30:25.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, you know, with real people, you know, we're able to take that a step further.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5428" target="_blank">01:30:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But with those first two levels, we're not seeing, you know, a tremendous amount of stuff that's not expected.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5434" target="_blank">01:30:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, this system exists.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5435" target="_blank">01:30:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">If we'd been doing this from absolute scratch, I think we would have a lot tougher of a time coming up with what we think the edges are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5441" target="_blank">01:30:41.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Whereas, you know, there's a system that already exists.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5443" target="_blank">01:30:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a lot of conversations to draw from.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5445" target="_blank">01:30:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We're able to run some of those back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5446" target="_blank">01:30:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So we'll look at conversations in the old system and replay them here and essentially just try to figure out, you know, where the edges are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5452" target="_blank">01:30:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Is there some ?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5461" target="_blank">01:31:01.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So is there a question about...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5462" target="_blank">01:31:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Are there questions about how to decide what goes in the state or not?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5465" target="_blank">01:31:05.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, the...</span></div><div

that initial payload, which I'll go back over here for, all of this stuff...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5474" target="_blank">01:31:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I think this one's probably the better example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5476" target="_blank">01:31:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5477" target="_blank">01:31:17.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So all of this stuff over here, this is all state.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5481" target="_blank">01:31:21.320</a></span> | <span class="t">There's not really a distinction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5483" target="_blank">01:31:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, everything that comes in to sort of preload the conversation is state.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5486" target="_blank">01:31:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Some of it is editable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5488" target="_blank">01:31:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Some of it's not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5489" target="_blank">01:31:29.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm trying to remember examples.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5490" target="_blank">01:31:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, here examples are, you can't change the source.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5493" target="_blank">01:31:33.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I couldn't say, you know, in the context of the LLM operation, this is not an available patient anymore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5497" target="_blank">01:31:37.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5498" target="_blank">01:31:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">The LLM's not allowed to do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5499" target="_blank">01:31:39.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It also can't change past messages.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5501" target="_blank">01:31:41.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So the LLM is not allowed to look at the message queue and say message five that went out three days ago no longer exists.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5506" target="_blank">01:31:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, that function doesn't exist.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5508" target="_blank">01:31:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So we've sort of just calibrated it to where the only things it can do is read the entire state, modify the patient data, modify messages, modify anchors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5516" target="_blank">01:31:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, unsent messages.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5518" target="_blank">01:31:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's, you know, it's just a software choice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5520" target="_blank">01:32:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, that's how we architected it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5521" target="_blank">01:32:01.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I guess if you have a session, do you want to kind of store the messages that went back and forth within the session?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5532" target="_blank">01:32:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">There's nothing inside, but if the context window gets too late and you kind of want to summarize it, in that case, would you want to be able to delete some messages or summarize it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5542" target="_blank">01:32:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Sure.</span></div><div

happened for us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5549" target="_blank">01:32:29.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, the way that we've structured it, there is not a single thinking operation that goes long enough to blow things up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5555" target="_blank">01:32:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But I will talk really quickly about retries.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5559" target="_blank">01:32:39.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So we do have the notion, and I'll just pop this up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5561" target="_blank">01:32:41.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe this is an easier way to see it.</span></div><div

again, the virtual OA talks to the evaluator, you know, at a certain point in the thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=5570"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6187" target="_blank">01:43:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so if you left the message in there, it would think that it understood the

sugarcoat where, like, there are some weird cases that if you don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6195"

target="_blank">01:43:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So it turns out, like, they were very invested, LangSmith was, or LangGraph, in graph flows.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6220" target="_blank">01:43:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And then they introduced this idea of, well, you don't really have to define it in the graph.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6223" target="_blank">01:43:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You can send anything

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6355" target="_blank">01:45:55.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So the question is about conflation of confidence scoring and

sort of operates now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6364" target="_blank">01:46:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">but I'm not sure that we're doing the confidence piece right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6368" target="_blank">01:46:08.320</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">01:46:11.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, do you have the information you need?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6373" target="_blank">01:46:13.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, is there anything like, do you understand the user's intent or, you know, did they say something ambiguous?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6378" target="_blank">01:46:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And we do see cases where it triggers, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6380" target="_blank">01:46:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not that we never see it, you know, correctly rate itself as being like, well, I'm not totally sure what they said.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6384" target="_blank">01:46:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's not as frequent as we would like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6386" target="_blank">01:46:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So we combine it with complexity in part because, you know, we just want to get it below that threshold so that we can have a human review it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6392" target="_blank">01:46:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not a perfect system, but it is a system that we think works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6395" target="_blank">01:46:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's more of a confidence that this falls within the happy path where we find polluting scenarios.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6402" target="_blank">01:46:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Correct.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6403" target="_blank">01:46:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's confidence that we know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6405" target="_blank">01:46:45.320</a></span> | <span

it's not confidence that the specific response is exact and perfect and whatever it is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6413" target="_blank">01:46:53.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It's confidence that we don't think that there's a blend of uncertainty on, you know, what the response is and complexity of the situation, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6419" target="_blank">01:46:59.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Either of those things can push it below the threshold.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6422" target="_blank">01:47:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">How are you posting the graph?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6427" target="_blank">01:47:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is all -- the question was about hosting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6430" target="_blank">01:47:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is all -- line graph has a pre-built containerization that you can use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6435" target="_blank">01:47:15.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We are using it with a couple of modifications.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6437" target="_blank">01:47:17.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We are essentially deploying both halves of this, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6441" target="_blank">01:47:21.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So to go back to this, we're deploying both halves of this with Terraform.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6444" target="_blank">01:47:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, everything's hooked up with GitHub Actions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6446" target="_blank">01:47:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, like, you know, we're doing as much of it as automatically as we can, but we are using most of the built-in line graph containerization.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6452" target="_blank">01:47:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6453" target="_blank">01:47:33.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6454" target="_blank">01:47:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">No, I mean, we have a conversation with Langchain actively about that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6463" target="_blank">01:47:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So the question actually is also the specific nature of how we need to be deployed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6468" target="_blank">01:47:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6469" target="_blank">01:47:49.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Lang graph platform doesn't currently support that, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6471" target="_blank">01:47:51.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, like, there -- it's -- it's all -- it's all evolving.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6473" target="_blank">01:47:53.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But we have had those conversations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6475" target="_blank">01:47:55.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Let me pause for a second.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6477" target="_blank">01:47:57.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We still have 10 minutes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6478" target="_blank">01:47:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so -- or roughly 10 minutes -- nine minutes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6480" target="_blank">01:48:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Let me just double-check my own list of things that I wanted to talk about just to make sure I didn't miss anything major.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6485" target="_blank">01:48:05.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Talked about that, talked about that, dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6490" target="_blank">01:48:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6491" target="_blank">01:48:11.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I think we more or less hit everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6493" target="_blank">01:48:13.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I'm happy just to open it up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6495" target="_blank">01:48:15.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I have a couple of final thoughts that I'll leave sitting up here if anyone's curious.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6498" target="_blank">01:48:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Any other questions?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6500" target="_blank">01:48:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">A bit of a tactical question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6503" target="_blank">01:48:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6504" target="_blank">01:48:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So the question was just about resource allocation to build these things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6522" target="_blank">01:48:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I mean, I think the best way to say it is just that we had built a handful of things like this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6528" target="_blank">01:48:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We had not done it for health care, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6530" target="_blank">01:48:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But we were able to bring some things in in terms of, you know, I had an open source line graph project that I was comfortable using as a base for this client code, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6537" target="_blank">01:48:57.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, we forked it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6538" target="_blank">01:48:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We brought it in private.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6539" target="_blank">01:48:59.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, but it got us, you know, part of the way there in part because this isn't a totally special snowflake.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6545" target="_blank">01:49:05.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a workflow with tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6546" target="_blank">01:49:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, we have, I think, spent less time on that upfront scaffolding each time we've done it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6552" target="_blank">01:49:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, we're looking at another project right now, which would be that much quicker.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6555" target="_blank">01:49:15.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So a lot of it is just once you do this and you understand the mechanism, getting to, you know, good enough or getting to a starting point is just a lot quicker.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6562" target="_blank">01:49:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It is something, though, we're like, you know, again, we are still working on this and we've been at it for a few months.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6568" target="_blank">01:49:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think we probably built what would have been a year's worth of conventional software, maybe more, right, you know, in that short period of time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6575" target="_blank">01:49:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Anything else?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6576" target="_blank">01:49:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6577" target="_blank">01:49:37.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So you mentioned you did a lot of Vibe coding on this one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6581" target="_blank">01:49:41.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Can you explore that a little bit?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6582" target="_blank">01:49:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm curious on how much specific language the tools, like, know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6587" target="_blank">01:49:47.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6588" target="_blank">01:49:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So the question was just about Vibe coding and how much the tools know of these frameworks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6595" target="_blank">01:49:55.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So the single biggest issue with Vibe coding, right, is when you're dealing with something new enough that the models don't really understand it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6600" target="_blank">01:50:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You can always just send them the API docs and they usually do pretty well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6605" target="_blank">01:50:05.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I ran into plenty of places with line graph where nobody had tried to do this before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6609" target="_blank">01:50:09.320</a></span> | <span class="t">No one had this exact bug and we just had to actively debug it back and forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6613" target="_blank">01:50:13.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I can definitely endorse O3 as a better debugger than Claude.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6616" target="_blank">01:50:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, we did have cases where we had to do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6619" target="_blank">01:50:19.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But for the most part, like, I mean, as long as you can at the docs, you know, you can get to a reasonable place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6625" target="_blank">01:50:25.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, like, I am a former engineer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6627" target="_blank">01:50:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I may eventually call myself a current engineer, but I kind of wouldn't right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6630" target="_blank">01:50:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, I don't have all the same practices and sort of all the same hygiene, you know, that our professional engineers do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6635" target="_blank">01:50:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But I do know how to smell kind of bad behavior.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6638" target="_blank">01:50:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm pretty good at prompting to get what I want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6640" target="_blank">01:50:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's kind of how it worked out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6643" target="_blank">01:50:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, yeah, please.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6646" target="_blank">01:50:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">No, there is MCP.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6652" target="_blank">01:50:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">MCP is in a couple places, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6654" target="_blank">01:50:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you look at the connection, there's actually two and one of them I just didn't totally label.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6658" target="_blank">01:50:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">The blueprint knowledge base at the top, that yellow box, that is an MCP connection in the line graph context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6664" target="_blank">01:51:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And then vertically, there's another set of connections back to the database.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6668" target="_blank">01:51:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's a couple places where it happens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6670" target="_blank">01:51:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But again, it's mostly for the interchange of state.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6673" target="_blank">01:51:13.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's for this, you know, reading of documents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6675" target="_blank">01:51:15.320</a></span> | <span class="t">That's primarily where it happens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6677" target="_blank">01:51:17.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I had a question about, like, the type of people that like to send a whole sentence, but, like, five different messages.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6686" target="_blank">01:51:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6687" target="_blank">01:51:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6688" target="_blank">01:51:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Absolutely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6689" target="_blank">01:51:29.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6690" target="_blank">01:51:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6691" target="_blank">01:51:31.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So the question is about rapid-fire text messages.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6694" target="_blank">01:51:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, yes, the way we handle that is twofold.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6697" target="_blank">01:51:37.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So one is that we do have a configurable...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6700" target="_blank">01:51:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not totally sure we have this turned on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6702" target="_blank">01:51:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But we have the idea of a configurable delay before we actually send it for processing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6705" target="_blank">01:51:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So if someone is going to send five text messages in a row, we wait five seconds before doing anything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6710" target="_blank">01:51:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6711" target="_blank">01:51:51.320</a></span> | <span class="t">That's when we can catch it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6712" target="_blank">01:51:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But the other way is we will invalidate previous running threads if someone texts in afterwards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6718" target="_blank">01:51:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6719" target="_blank">01:51:59.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We don't want an in-process response.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6720" target="_blank">01:52:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We want to take whatever the complete context of the conversation was, send all of that in,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6725" target="_blank">01:52:05.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and then we respond to five messages at once.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6727" target="_blank">01:52:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6728" target="_blank">01:52:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's a combination of smart retries and smart invalidation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6733" target="_blank">01:52:13.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So in your case, if a user decides to act rogue, basically...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6739" target="_blank">01:52:19.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6740" target="_blank">01:52:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">...and giving some irrelevant...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6742" target="_blank">01:52:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6743" target="_blank">01:52:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">...absolutely in-relevant responses...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6745" target="_blank">01:52:25.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6746" target="_blank">01:52:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">...because you are not using a rack, the system is not getting any...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6750" target="_blank">01:52:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, this question was about rogue responses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6754" target="_blank">01:52:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, in general, we are giving some pretty basic guidance around, you're only here to answer treatment-related questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6763" target="_blank">01:52:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">If someone wants to talk to you about the weather, you just say, I'm sorry, I can't help with that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6766" target="_blank">01:52:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, or other worse things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6768" target="_blank">01:52:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, generally speaking, that works pretty well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6771" target="_blank">01:52:51.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We have it pretty well-tuned to escalate, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6773" target="_blank">01:52:53.320</a></span> | <span class="t">If someone just is essentially going off the rails and you can't think of a response, you just say, I'm sorry, I'm gonna get somebody to help you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6778" target="_blank">01:52:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And it sets the confidence low, and then a human can get involved.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6781" target="_blank">01:53:01.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It doesn't, in practice, happen that much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6783" target="_blank">01:53:03.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, again, if you're involved in this, like, you know, if you're involved in this and you take the time to actually engage with the system,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6788" target="_blank">01:53:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you want the result, and you probably want to get back to your life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6791" target="_blank">01:53:11.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So we don't see a tremendous amount of it, but that's the way that we would deal with it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6796" target="_blank">01:53:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">At any point in your development process, did you get frustrated enough with Landgraf where you thought that it certainly would be different?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6804" target="_blank">01:53:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, did I get frustrated enough with Landgraf at any point?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6807" target="_blank">01:53:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Honestly, so the one thing I'll say, and I mean, this is just totally a personal project.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6812" target="_blank">01:53:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I was doing a side thing around college counseling, and I just have this sitting here because I show it off sometimes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6819" target="_blank">01:53:39.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And the point was, I went into this project explicitly trying to avoid it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6824" target="_blank">01:53:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I said, I'm going to do a very similar thing where I have an AI in the middle of a workflow, and I want it to ask questions, and I want it to think.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6829" target="_blank">01:53:49.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And I do not want to use Landgraf or Crew or any of these other frameworks because I don't want to be dependent on them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6833" target="_blank">01:53:53.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I asked, you know, I asked Klein to write me a layer that was pretty good at, you know, talking to these models and structuring a thinking process, and it did fine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6843" target="_blank">01:54:03.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, the reason to have the framework is in part because, you know, again, we won't be with this client forever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6848" target="_blank">01:54:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We want them to have something they can operate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6850" target="_blank">01:54:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We want them to have something explainable and easy to use.</span></div><div

much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6858" target="_blank">01:54:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Choose your tools

why Klein over Cursor?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6865" target="_blank">01:54:25.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you so

Cursor and Winsurf is great, by the way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6875" target="_blank">01:54:35.320</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">01:54:37.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Cursor and Winsurf, as two examples, are just trying to hit this sort of narrow, you know, thing about it has to cost $20 a month, and therefore it has to be heavily optimized about how it sends tokens in different places.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6889"

target="_blank">01:54:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, it's very smart.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6895" target="_blank">01:54:55.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But, like, it's just giving tools to a smart model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6897" target="_blank">01:54:57.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And that smart model can cost whatever it costs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6899" target="_blank">01:54:59.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Klein is the spiritual cousin to Cloud Code and Codex, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6902" target="_blank">01:55:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, it's that style of thing, as opposed to an IDE that has to hit this very narrow target and has to do a lot of pre-optimization on how the tokens flow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6908" target="_blank">01:55:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6909" target="_blank">01:55:09.320</a></span> | <span class="t">How do you balance the tasks that you've done before you've been played versus, like, relying on evals and productive data?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6918" target="_blank">01:55:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">The guys that follow the problem?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6919" target="_blank">01:55:19.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6920" target="_blank">01:55:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I mean, honestly, this is also another place where I will raise my hand and say this is why I'm not a real software engineer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6926" target="_blank">01:55:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't have a robust testing framework on my Python code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6929" target="_blank">01:55:29.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I haven't really needed it, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6931" target="_blank">01:55:31.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Or at the very least, like, I'm using evals and sort of overall performance of the system as the better benchmark, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6936" target="_blank">01:55:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So evals are important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6937" target="_blank">01:55:37.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We have to have those.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6938" target="_blank">01:55:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, the other side of the code, like, you know, Stride is a TDD shop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6941" target="_blank">01:55:41.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, our software engineers are very, very good at test-driven development.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6945" target="_blank">01:55:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the blue box is very well tested.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6948" target="_blank">01:55:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But just my code, you know, very much is eval sort of tested instead.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6952" target="_blank">01:55:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not a great answer, but, like, that is kind of how I thought about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6955" target="_blank">01:55:55.320</a></span> | <span class="t">All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn79oS4MZFI&t=6958"
