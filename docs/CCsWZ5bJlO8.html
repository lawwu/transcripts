This is an unofficial guide. I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=19" target="_blank">00:00:19.360</a></span> | <span class="t">work at Apple. We'll talk about it in a sec. So this is my background, my PhD in data science,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=27" target="_blank">00:00:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">biomedical informatics. I've sold two companies, one in AI and data, one in cyber security and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=32" target="_blank">00:00:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">infrastructure. I'm at South Park Commons. I'm building a company called Confidence Security,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=35" target="_blank">00:00:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">which we'll get to at the end. But again, disclaimer, I'm not an Apple employee. I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=40" target="_blank">00:00:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">not speaking on their behalf. Everything I've gleaned is from public sources. And hopefully,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=44" target="_blank">00:00:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">what we'll learn today is some tools that we can use ourselves. There's really six key components</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=49" target="_blank">00:00:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and some approaches to ensure privacy. And privacy and security are very related, not perfectly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=54" target="_blank">00:00:54.720</a></span> | <span class="t">overlapping, but related. So before I get there, I know that we're in the security track,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=59" target="_blank">00:00:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">but I want to motivate why you might care about privacy. Not everyone believes that you should</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=64" target="_blank">00:01:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">have privacy. So let me just give some examples. This year, DeepSeq leaked a million sensitive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=72" target="_blank">00:01:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">records of chat logs. And you might say to yourself, like, well, that's DeepSeq. Everyone knew that was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=77" target="_blank">00:01:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">going to happen. But before I show you the next piece, I want to poll the audience. How many here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=83" target="_blank">00:01:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">care about privacy? All right. How many of us use ChatGPT? All right. How many consider ChatGPT to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=93" target="_blank">00:01:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">private? Okay, good. How many use the ChatGPT private mode? And then how many use the API but with zero data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">retention, kind of like the default state? Okay, great. Well, as of yesterday, OpenAI has to retain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">everything anyway, whether or not you flagged it as private or not. And I don't want to get into the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">comments of why they have to do that. But the point is, is that they have the capability of retaining</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">your private chats that you can flag on the UI as not private other things. And obviously, being forced to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">do that is not great. But this is why we should all care about privacy. So Apple doesn't want to have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">these headlines because they're one of their major value props is privacy. So let's talk a little bit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">about the problems that Apple solved and then how we might use it. So fundamentally, AI requires more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">compute than a phone. But obviously, they want to bundle AI into their phones. Privacy is a major selling</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">point. Anytime you give up private data to something remote, you're inherently reducing your privacy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">rate. Anytime I give you my data, it's not as private as it was the second before. So the question</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">that Apple is trying to answer in their PCC system, which is now available on all of our iPhones and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">used for inference, is how do you get remote compute while remaining private? And the simple way to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">that would be to buy all the iPhones H100s, pair them in the cloud, you get your own H100, boom. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">obviously, AI is even more expensive. So that's not going to work. So they actually need some approach,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">which is how do you get remote compute while remaining private and cheap? Otherwise, it doesn't work. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to kind of frame the problem this way. You've got an iPhone, you've got an untrusted remote</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">server, you can't see inside of it. It's a black box. Once you give them your data, you have no idea what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">happens inside. And what Apple does is tries to make it not a black box so that the iPhone has some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">control of what happens to the data inside Apple's remote servers. And then hopefully that this trusted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">remote service is also hard to hack. So for the remainder of the talk, and we're not going to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">able to get into all of it in 16 minutes, but we're going to talk about Apple's PCC requirements that they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">set up. And I'll review a conceptual architecture about how they meet those requirements. Then we'll go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">into two specific components of the six because I don't have time to go through all six and you'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">be bored by that point. And then talk about some pros and cons of Apple's things and how we might</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.720</a></span> | <span class="t">use some of those components ourselves. So there are five key requirements to Apple's private cloud</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">compute that they're trying to meet when they design the system. The first one is stateless computation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">This is essentially the guarantee that when Apple receives your data, it's only used to satisfy the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.040</a></span> | <span class="t">request and cannot be used. It's impossible to use it for anything else. You can't log it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">anything like that. The second thing is enforceable guarantees. The notion that the code, everything's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">enforced with code, not by some sort of policy, not I shouldn't SSH to the instance, but I can SSH to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">instances. No, there's no SSH on the instance. You can't SSH to it. You don't want to save things? Well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">don't have a disk, right? So these are what they call enforceable guarantees, not just policies. The third</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">principle or requirement is non-targetability. That means that if you wanted to hack my data on PCC,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">you'd have to target everyone and sift through all of it rather than having some easy way to find just me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">No privileged runtime access. I just briefly touched on it earlier, but essentially there's no way to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">bypass these restrictions in production. And then the final one and the most important one is verifiable</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">transparency. Verifiable transparency essentially says we can prove that all of the above items are true.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Great. So let's talk about, again, this is a little more bigger representation of the black box.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">In a classic, you know, kind of remote system, you have some sort of auth service, and then we have an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=329" target="_blank">00:05:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">AI engine. And in this AI engine, you have some SRE who can access it and some disk that you can write to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">it. But again, the iPhone doesn't know what it's sending its data to, but this is fundamental. So let's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">see how we can change this to get to some of these at a conceptual level. So the first thing that Apple does</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=348" target="_blank">00:05:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">is it adds an anonymizer. And this anonymizer is the first part of two parts of non-targetability. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=357" target="_blank">00:05:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">ideally, right, Apple can't tell who the data is coming from, so it would be harder for an attacker</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to come and, like, fish out my particular set of data. If you're a student looking at this, you're still</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=370" target="_blank">00:06:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">off behind the anonymizer, and so the iPhone provides some sort of auth credentials, and those auth credentials</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=374" target="_blank">00:06:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">are obviously tied to the user. So the second thing that Apple does is separates auth. And conceptually,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">you think of this as if you're going to the arcade and you want to go spend your money on arcade</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">machines, you first put your money into the coin machine, you get some coins out. These coins are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=389" target="_blank">00:06:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">anonymous. Now you can go to the machine and no one knows what machines you spend your money on. That's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">essentially what happens here. It's called blind signatures. We're not going to have time to get into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=398" target="_blank">00:06:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">it today, but that's what happens. So now the iPhone is making an anonymous request, going through an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=404" target="_blank">00:06:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">anonymizer that's taking everyone's. It's kind of like Tor. It's like laundering everyone's data,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=409" target="_blank">00:06:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">so that if someone were to access the system internally, they wouldn't know who it's coming</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=415" target="_blank">00:06:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">from. So that gets us non-targetability. The second thing that Apple does is it changes the set of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=420" target="_blank">00:07:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">requests that are happening. The first thing it does is, before it sends its data, it says, "What are you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=425" target="_blank">00:07:05.040</a></span> | <span class="t">running?" And if the AI engine replies, "Well, I'm running this and only this," the iPhone might say, "Okay, I trust that." And if that remains</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=434" target="_blank">00:07:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">true, then you can run this AI on the data that I'm submitting. This is how they achieve verifiable</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=442" target="_blank">00:07:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">transparency. There's a little more subtlety to that, which we are going to get into, but it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=446" target="_blank">00:07:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">essentially the iPhone says, "I trust the code that you're running. You can only decrypt my data if you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=449" target="_blank">00:07:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">still running that code." So the iPhone can verify what they're doing. The next thing, no privilege runtime</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=455" target="_blank">00:07:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">access. That was easy. Just get rid of SSHD. Make it no way of accessing those machines. Enforceable guarantees.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=462" target="_blank">00:07:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Get rid of the disk. We talked about that. And then stateless computation, again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=466" target="_blank">00:07:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">with no disk, no access. There's nothing to do with the data other than respond to the iPhone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=470" target="_blank">00:07:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And since the iPhone verified the code that was running on this machine, it knows it's not being</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=476" target="_blank">00:07:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">logged anywhere before it gives them the data. Okay. So they achieve those five guarantees that I talked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=484" target="_blank">00:08:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">about here using six technical components. And again, we're going to go into two of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=489" target="_blank">00:08:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">But I'll describe them all very briefly. Oblivious HTTP is a spec developed by Cloudflare and Apple and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=497" target="_blank">00:08:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">others that allows you to essentially make anonymous requests using a third party to use the launder your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=505" target="_blank">00:08:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">requests through this third party. So all of their requests that goes to Apple's private cloud compute first goes through Cloudflare.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=510" target="_blank">00:08:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So when Apple receives it, it only knows that it came from Cloudflare, not from an individual user's IP address.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=515" target="_blank">00:08:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">The second thing that they use is blind signatures. Blind signatures is that arcade analogy that I gave</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=521" target="_blank">00:08:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">you. But it essentially is a way to auth separately and then verify that you're bearing true authentication,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=528" target="_blank">00:08:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but you can't link it to your identity. And again, we don't have time to go into that. But if you want to look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=532" target="_blank">00:08:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">it up, it's a formal spec as well. There's lots of packages and open source libraries that let you use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=536" target="_blank">00:08:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">that. Third component is the secure enclave. This is an equivalent we have in our world, if we're not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=544" target="_blank">00:09:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">programming on Apple, is TPMs, if you've heard of that. But they're essentially a place, a separate piece</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=549" target="_blank">00:09:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">of hardware where the private keys are kept. And that makes a guarantee that those keys can never be removed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=556" target="_blank">00:09:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">from the hardware. That's really important because you don't want the keys to be given away that does</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=563" target="_blank">00:09:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">all of these. All of the interactions that this is doing is with keys that they prove who they are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=568" target="_blank">00:09:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">If they could move it and have some third party hold it, then it wouldn't be trusted. You could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=572" target="_blank">00:09:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">essentially fake everyone out that you are an official AI engine, but actually you're somewhere</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=576" target="_blank">00:09:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">else. So the secure enclave helps with that. Again, we won't be getting into those. We're going to get into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=580" target="_blank">00:09:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">these two. The last one is secure boot and hardened operating system. This is like a standard technique,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=586" target="_blank">00:09:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">but it's essentially they run a very limited version of iOS that makes it very difficult to hack or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=592" target="_blank">00:09:52.720</a></span> | <span class="t">modify. Everything has to be signed just like if you've done an iOS app. Now you have to do signatures,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=598" target="_blank">00:09:58.240</a></span> | <span class="t">but theirs is like even crazier. Okay, so the ones we're going to talk about are remote attestation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=604" target="_blank">00:10:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">That was this flow I talked about here. Great. Then the other one is the transparency log. The</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=612" target="_blank">00:10:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">transparency log is a record of all of the software that Apple is deploying on their private nodes so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=617" target="_blank">00:10:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">that you can go and verify what's on the record is actually what's being sent to you during the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=622" target="_blank">00:10:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">attestation. Okay, so let's talk about remote attestation very briefly. I'm going to talk about it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=629" target="_blank">00:10:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">abstractly not with iPhones. So you have some client and the client says, "What are you running?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=634" target="_blank">00:10:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And the server replies with two things: a set of signed claims and then a public key. And the signed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=640" target="_blank">00:10:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">claims essentially say, "I'm on genuine hardware. I'm running a genuine GPU. I am running this set of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=648" target="_blank">00:10:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">software. I use this bootloader. I use this version of Linux." And then the client gets to look at those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=655" target="_blank">00:10:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">claims and decide whether it trusts that version. It might be like, "Oh, I only trust this version of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=661" target="_blank">00:11:01.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the Linux kernel and above." Or, "I only trust that it's been signed by Apple." And if so, it can use this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=669" target="_blank">00:11:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">public key that comes across to encrypt data that is later sent to the server. And this is really important,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=678" target="_blank">00:11:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">which is this public key and these claims are tied together. So during later interactions with the server,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=683" target="_blank">00:11:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the client will encrypt using the public key and the signed claims. And the server will only be able</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=688" target="_blank">00:11:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">to decrypt if it is still matching those signed claims. There's a whole bunch of cryptography that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=693" target="_blank">00:11:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">makes this possible and a bunch of certificate chains and a bunch of like trusts and vendors. But that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=699" target="_blank">00:11:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the fundamental idea. And this is what is letting you change it black box to something that's a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=704" target="_blank">00:11:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">more translucent, right? Not just throwing it over the wall. You can kind of see what's going on inside.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=710" target="_blank">00:11:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. The second thing is the transparency log. Transparency log is actually very simple conceptually.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=716" target="_blank">00:11:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just a database with records for each software release or each component in a software release signed by a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=723" target="_blank">00:12:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">particular person. So, for example, in this record, Bob added this binary or piece of compiled source code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=733" target="_blank">00:12:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is the hash of that binary on November 1st, 24. And then that's it. It's just a declaration that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=739" target="_blank">00:12:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">this binary was signed by Bob. Why does that matter? Why would you care about this? Well, first of all,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=746" target="_blank">00:12:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">reviewers can go through and offline look at these binaries that are made publicly available</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=753" target="_blank">00:12:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and verify their behavior. And so then when you get a remote attestation and the remote attestation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=759" target="_blank">00:12:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">says this hash of this binary is there, you can be like, oh yeah, I've already checked this binary.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=763" target="_blank">00:12:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I believe that it's doing the right thing. The second thing, so that's what I said the second point,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=768" target="_blank">00:12:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">which is you can check the remote attestations match what's in the log. And then finally, if you see an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=773" target="_blank">00:12:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">attestation that's not on the log, you know the whole system's been compromised. Because if it's not on the log,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=779" target="_blank">00:12:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">definitely someone is like doing some sort of shenanigans, right? They might have like hijacked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=783" target="_blank">00:13:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">your connection, whatever. And it's just because like a limited set of people can write to this log</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=789" target="_blank">00:13:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">and there's no way to modify the log, right? It's append only. It uses like a Merkle tree so that you can't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=794" target="_blank">00:13:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">change the contents. Great. So that is the transparency log. So let me tell you how this all comes together,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=803" target="_blank">00:13:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">right? So remote attestation is this flow. Again, the iPhone firsts through the anonymizer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=811" target="_blank">00:13:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">requests a remote attestation package and then says, well, if I believe that remote attestation package,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=817" target="_blank">00:13:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I trust the contents that is running on the server. I can then send my data and I phrase this as try to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=823" target="_blank">00:13:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">decrypt the data on the AI. Again, if the attestation changed, the AI engine would not be able to decrypt the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=829" target="_blank">00:13:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">data, right? So that's the most important part, right? It says, I'm running this thing. Trust me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=834" target="_blank">00:13:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it says, I trust you. Okay, great. Encrypt it. And I can only decrypt it as long as it's still</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=838" target="_blank">00:13:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">running the exact thing I said I trusted. And the second item we talked about is the transparency log,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=844" target="_blank">00:14:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">which is check if the attested claims match the transparency log. And this transparency log we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=849" target="_blank">00:14:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">talked about. So on here, Apple is writing a lot, a lot of software onto the log and then essentially</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=854" target="_blank">00:14:14.720</a></span> | <span class="t">saying, trust what's on the log, you can verify it offline. And then when the attestation claims come</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=860" target="_blank">00:14:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">in, just double check that they do indeed match. Okay, and then I don't have time to get into all of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=868" target="_blank">00:14:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">these. But here are some of the other items that we talked about, the blind signatures, the oblivious</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=876" target="_blank">00:14:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">HTTP is the anonymizer, blind signatures are the way they do the auth. And then of course,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=882" target="_blank">00:14:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">over here, we have the secure enclave, I kind of put that outside of the AI engine, they're separate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=888" target="_blank">00:14:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">pieces of hardware. And then the hardening is just this little lock, but you know, we don't have time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=893" target="_blank">00:14:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">to get into it. And that's kind of at a very conceptual level, like you could essentially do a PhD on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=901" target="_blank">00:15:01.440</a></span> | <span class="t">each of these, how Apple's PCC works. So what are the gaps? What are the downsides? Well, first, you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=909" target="_blank">00:15:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to put all of your trust in Apple still, right? On the bright side, like Apple runs their whole supply chain,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=915" target="_blank">00:15:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">they verify the nodes when they get them at their data center, they actually re-sign them with what's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=921" target="_blank">00:15:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">called data center identity keys or something like that, DCI case. But there's no guarantee that Apple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=928" target="_blank">00:15:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">doesn't share the certs with anyone, or insecurely generate them, or set the private key to one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=933" target="_blank">00:15:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">everywhere. Now, I think they are trying to do their best effort, but you still have to trust. You've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=939" target="_blank">00:15:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">shifted the trust now into like Apple's behavior rather than the hardware. But anyhow,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=945" target="_blank">00:15:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">they're only available on Apple devices for consumer use on official apps. Maybe at some point,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=950" target="_blank">00:15:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">they'll make PCC available to everyone else, but not yet. So what trade-offs do is Apple PCC make,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=957" target="_blank">00:15:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">they're limited by latencies to Apple data centers. So they do have local models first that they try and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=965" target="_blank">00:16:05.040</a></span> | <span class="t">use, but if those local models aren't adequate, they'll send them to data centers. As we start to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=971" target="_blank">00:16:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">like real-time voice and other things, this is a little more latencies, like adds a lot more latency</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=977" target="_blank">00:16:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">to the system. The compute costs are higher. There's doing a lot more encryption. There's like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=982" target="_blank">00:16:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I didn't, I mean, you're not seeing it, but there's like six layers of encryption before it even gets to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=986" target="_blank">00:16:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">that node. That actually, that actually makes it happen. So you're spending a little bit more compute</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=990" target="_blank">00:16:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">there. Like I told you, no custom models, no fine tuning. The client libraries are very complicated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=996" target="_blank">00:16:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The client having to orchestrate all of these requests, this transparency log, this auth,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=1002" target="_blank">00:16:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">that's way more complicated than a simple HTTP request, which kind of sucks. And what if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=1008" target="_blank">00:16:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">your iPhone goes down after it's authenticated, and then it loses all the authentication keys? Like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=1014" target="_blank">00:16:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">you've essentially like lost all of your state, right? So there's a lot more stateful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=1018" target="_blank">00:16:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Operationally complex. You can't SSH into the machine and there's no logging. So that's difficult.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=1026" target="_blank">00:17:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Not everyone would sign up for that. You can't do any usage tracking. If you could do usage tracking,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=1031" target="_blank">00:17:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">then you'd be identified, right? And so Apple can't like parcel out, you know, you get 2000 tokens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=1038" target="_blank">00:17:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">They do do some fraud and abuse tracking at a very gross level. But if you wanted to use this and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=1043" target="_blank">00:17:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe pass on your costs, a similar architecture and pass on your costs to the customer, you wouldn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=1048" target="_blank">00:17:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">be able to know which customer was doing what, right? And then not open to third party developers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=1053" target="_blank">00:17:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. What can I learn from this? I gave you the list of six that Apple uses. And here's what's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=1060" target="_blank">00:17:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">available in our world. If you're not developing on Apple Silicon and Apple hardware, you still have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=1065" target="_blank">00:17:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">oblivious HTTP and blind signatures. There are libraries to do that. So we don't have secure enclaves,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=1070" target="_blank">00:17:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">but we have TPMs. Almost all Intel and AMD hardware now has TPMs. And then in the cloud environment,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=1076" target="_blank">00:17:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">they have virtual TPMs that provide the same behavior as a TPM. And again, that's where you put a bunch of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=1082" target="_blank">00:18:02.560</a></span> | <span class="t">your private keys that are tied to that public key that I talked about. These are available for us. Secure boot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=1088" target="_blank">00:18:08.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and hardened operating system. Remote attestation is kind of available. It's kind of tied to the TPM.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=1096" target="_blank">00:18:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">There aren't great standards yet, but there is a little bit of work there. Transparency log. There</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=1102" target="_blank">00:18:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">are two open ones. One's called SIGSUM. The other one's called SIGSTORE. If you've heard of them, if not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=1109" target="_blank">00:18:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And then confidential VMs are just becoming available on cloud providers with GPUs. So confidential computing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=1116" target="_blank">00:18:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">has been around for a while, but now you also have to have confidential H100s. And only H100s support,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=1122" target="_blank">00:18:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and H200s support confidentiality. What that means is that their memory is encrypted. So if you were to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=1127" target="_blank">00:18:47.520</a></span> | <span class="t">physically go up to the H100 and like try to look at its RAM, you wouldn't be able to see what's going on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=1132" target="_blank">00:18:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">there or figure out what's going on there. And then finally, what we have that Apple doesn't have is we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=1137" target="_blank">00:18:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">have open source and we have reproducible builds. We have the ability to link the source code to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=1141" target="_blank">00:19:01.440</a></span> | <span class="t">binaries. And so we can have security research look at the source code as well as, you know, black box</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=1148" target="_blank">00:19:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">test the binaries and develop confidence in what the server might be running. All right, what's next?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=1153" target="_blank">00:19:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so Apple has set the standard for private AI and the market is definitely following.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=1161" target="_blank">00:19:21.280</a></span> | <span class="t">That was in June of 2024. It wasn't actually released until October of 2024. Azure Open AI,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=1166" target="_blank">00:19:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">or sorry, Azure AI, not Azure Open AI, is doing private inferencing starting as in September.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=1171" target="_blank">00:19:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">They're still in private preview. And then about a month ago, Meta of all companies, I guess I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=1176" target="_blank">00:19:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">recorded, Meta of all these great companies, also added private processing, which if you read their blog</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=1183" target="_blank">00:19:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">post, it's like they copy and pasted this. Maybe they used Llama to rewrite it into their language,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=1188" target="_blank">00:19:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">but it's essentially identical, which is great for all of us thinking about privacy. And sure,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=1192" target="_blank">00:19:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm sure WhatsApp also doesn't want those like press releases like I showed earlier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=1196" target="_blank">00:19:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'll just close by saying we're building the same thing. But for everyone else, if you're not on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=1203" target="_blank">00:20:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Apple or you're not in WhatsApp, we have it. It's called Confident Security. And if you'd like to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=1209" target="_blank">00:20:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">talk more, let me know. By the way, this is an anti-AI shirt, which means that if you take pictures</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=1214" target="_blank">00:20:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">of me, it will confuse all the facial recognition stuff.

If you have some cool</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=1219" target="_blank">00:20:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">questions and want to talk afterward, if it deems it worthy, I will give you an anti-AI shirt. We also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCsWZ5bJlO8&t=1224" target="_blank">00:20:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">have some other privacy-based swag in the back.
