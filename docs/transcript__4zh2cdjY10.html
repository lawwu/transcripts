If you don't breastfeed, your child will be a loser.</p><p>If you co-sleep, your child will die. If you don't co-sleep, your child will never love you. The thing that's on the other end of it is a kind of devastating outcome in some way. And the reality is very few of our parenting choices have any impact anywhere near that important.</p><p>Maybe that isn't very nice to hear, but for the most part, many of the choices we make aren't really gonna matter very much in the end based on the data. And most of the time, there isn't a particularly correct way and any choice you make is unlikely to matter that much in the long run.</p></div></div></body></html>
