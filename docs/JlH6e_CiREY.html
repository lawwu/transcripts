His main takeaway was that stocks are more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlH6e_CiREY&t=371" target="_blank">00:06:11.860</a></span> | <span class="t">similar to bonds than most people think, especially when it comes to a highly inflationary environment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlH6e_CiREY&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.100</a></span> | <span class="t">For bonds, it's not necessarily the rates rising that hurts as much as the inflation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlH6e_CiREY&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It's the real returns over the long term that can eat into bonds.

But his point was that, if you look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlH6e_CiREY&t=392" target="_blank">00:06:32.660</a></span> | <span class="t">back at history, the ROE, the return on equity for U.S. corporations, is relatively sticky</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlH6e_CiREY&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.420</a></span> | <span class="t">and stable over the decades.

"Your future results will be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlH6e_CiREY&t=409" target="_blank">00:06:49.700</a></span> | <span class="t">governed by three variables.

So, there we are. 12%, which is the ROE, before taxes and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlH6e_CiREY&t=418" target="_blank">00:06:58.140</a></span> | <span class="t">inflation, 7% after taxes and before inflation, and maybe 0% after taxes and inflation.
