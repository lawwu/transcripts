How does TikTok seem to know so much about me and tailor's contacts so accurately to my interests and behavior?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=7" target="_blank">00:00:07.640</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a good question because I think it connects to our deep dive where we talked about content like TikTok being ultra processed that unlike other types of content like television, streaming or games on your phone, it has a way of being hyper palatable and it has a way of pushing your buttons in ways that's really psychologically unhealthy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=27" target="_blank">00:00:27.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think it's worth looking into because I actually think I know something about this. I mean, I did some research on this back when there was an internal document that got leaked and this was sort of making its rounds and I read a bunch of accounts of this document.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=39" target="_blank">00:00:39.460</a></span> | <span class="t">I have like a generic sense of the techniques used by a TikTok algorithm. It's probably worth briefly going over because I think people have this wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=48" target="_blank">00:00:48.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And when you have it wrong, it changes the way you think about this world and what to do about the harms of this world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=54" target="_blank">00:00:54.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I looked up a quote here. I think this sort of establishes the way that we kind of get this wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=61" target="_blank">00:01:01.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So here's a quote about TikTok that comes from the founder of an organization called Algo Transparency, which I think kind of gives the wrong idea, but let me read this and then I'll give you the right idea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=71" target="_blank">00:01:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Technically, all of that is true, but I think the way that we talk about algorithms here gives us an incomplete understanding of how these things actually work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=100" target="_blank">00:01:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I think when we see those type of description of algorithms, what we really imagine is sort of like someone making a list of descriptive information about a user.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=108" target="_blank">00:01:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, we've learned that we learned that he's into this, not into that. We imagine an algorithm sort of like looking at these semantically rich descriptions of things you're into or not into and, and deciding according to some sort of complicated rules that someone programmed in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. Well, why don't we then take this and mix it with that? And we have some good stuff of that over here. And we're trying to emphasize this type of content. Oh, and I've analyzed, I think this type of content is, is, is, it feels like people like it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it's like a network scheduler. Let's show him more of that. Like, so I think that, that image of an algorithm, it's like a network scheduler looking at a board full of pieces of information on index cards and making a decision. Like, well, what are we going to schedule next? I think this is really going to catch his attention.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">We have that idea, which is sort of personified. We imagine like there's a human involved and it gives us the sense that we can turn these various knobs and say things like, Hey, adjust your algorithm to not recommend stuff that is going to be so addictive or adjust your algorithm to like turn down the, the, the outrage meter from like a 10 to a nine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.280</a></span> | <span class="t">When we think about the algorithm is like a person with all this information, making scheduling decisions. We think we have all this control over it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.100</a></span> | <span class="t">That's not really how this works. I'm going to try here to draw a picture for those who are watching instead of just listing and God help us all for me doing this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But I want to give you a better sense of how the general class of algorithms that we think powers TikTok actually works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can imagine what we do is that every time you watch a video, there's a piece of information that's gathered, but what's gathered is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.100</a></span> | <span class="t">a description of the video. This description though is going to be a bunch of numbers. So there's going to be, you could think of it like a, a lot of different categories you could use to apply to a video.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, uh, cats could be a category. If it has a lot of cats, that number is high or low or something like this. Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you have different numbers in each of these categories sort of gives you a list of numbers that describes the video.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So if we had, for example, just two numbers, we could imagine having a flat surface, like a two dimensional plane where you could put a, each spot in here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Like if we put a spot right here is associated with, uh, two numbers, like with that number and with that number. Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can imagine what we do is every time you watch a video, we can put a little dot on here that represents its description and we can make that dot bigger or smaller depending.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And this seems to be what's most crucial for a TikTok, how long you watch it, like what percentage of the video you actually watched.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So like maybe you watched a video over here real briefly, small dot over here though, there's a video you watched all the way through.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.700</a></span> | <span class="t">There's like a big dot over there and maybe there's a medium dot and you kind of sample some videos over here, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And over time, we're kind of just giving you videos to watch and we see how long are you watching each of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So now we have a bunch of these numbers. We have this plot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Technically it's going to be a sort of weighted multidimensional scatter plot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And now when we want to show you a new video, we being TikTok, the algorithm is super mathematical.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.640</a></span> | <span class="t">It says, okay, I'm just going to randomly choose a video in this spot of possible videos to show you, but I'm not going to select from every area equally likely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.540</a></span> | <span class="t">The more sort of green real estate there is in a certain place, like the more I'm going to be pulled in that direction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.180</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like I might select something over here, but I'm way more likely to select something over here because there's so many, not only just so many other dots, but so many big dots.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a lot of watch time over in this space of the possible videos.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And what we're implicitly doing here is kind of creating a region.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.080</a></span> | <span class="t">These are all going to be probably roughly similarly types of videos.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Now again, my algorithm is doing something very simple.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.340</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just randomly choose a thing, but wait your choice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=345" target="_blank">00:05:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, the more stuff there is nearby it, more mass you want to put on it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's like a lot of probabilistic ways you could do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm going to start selecting more videos near stuff you already like, but like occasionally, you know, you roll a dice enough time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes you're going to roll six, three times in a row.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=361" target="_blank">00:06:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Occasionally I'll pull some stuff over here as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=364" target="_blank">00:06:04.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And maybe what I'll do, and we think that the TikTok algorithm does this on purpose.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.460</a></span> | <span class="t">It will on a semi-regular basis say, forget, forget the weights.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=373" target="_blank">00:06:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And let me just like purely draw randomly just to make sure there's not something we haven't tried yet that you really like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=378" target="_blank">00:06:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And then like maybe over here, there is like a whole bunch of Cal network memes and immediately these start getting watched well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=387" target="_blank">00:06:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And now it's like, you're getting a lot of Cal network memes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=391" target="_blank">00:06:31.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And then like a lot of the times of the stuff over here and occasionally we'll sample other types of things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=398" target="_blank">00:06:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what's happening underneath the covers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=400" target="_blank">00:06:40.140</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not just two numbers though.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">It'll be like a hundred numbers or a thousand numbers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=404" target="_blank">00:06:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is each of these spots is in a thousand dimensional space.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=407" target="_blank">00:06:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So the math is different, but it's the same idea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=412" target="_blank">00:06:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">What's key about this is the algorithm is stupid.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=414" target="_blank">00:06:54.740</a></span> | <span class="t">The algorithm, there is no complicated code in there that humans wrote that's like, how do I balance this versus that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=421" target="_blank">00:07:01.380</a></span> | <span class="t">It doesn't label things necessarily in the way you think, like, is this outrageous or not?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=426" target="_blank">00:07:06.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, it does categorization and try to get rid of stuff for safety purposes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=430" target="_blank">00:07:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But like it really just mainly treats stuff like these numbers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=433" target="_blank">00:07:13.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's just blindly doing this simple repetitive loop, pick another video probabilistically from the space of videos, weight your choice towards stuff that's already been watched.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=444" target="_blank">00:07:24.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So you're more likely to choose something near a bunch of other stuff that's been watched a while than other stuff on a regular basis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=450" target="_blank">00:07:30.840</a></span> | <span class="t">They'll randomly just choose something completely different to make sure that we're exploring other types of videos.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=456" target="_blank">00:07:36.040</a></span> | <span class="t">They might like this simple loop run tight enough for the only input it's getting from you is how long did you watch each video?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=463" target="_blank">00:07:43.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And how do we automatically categorize the video with some sort of neural net?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=467" target="_blank">00:07:47.040</a></span> | <span class="t">That is enough to like within 30 or 40 minutes be eerily accurate in showing you stuff that you really like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=475" target="_blank">00:07:55.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Without there ever having to be anywhere like an English language list of like topics and here's what this person likes and complicated algorithms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=483" target="_blank">00:08:03.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's a very simple weighted random sampling algorithm with a little bit of exploration or exploitation types of logic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=491" target="_blank">00:08:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">It's called multi-armed band type stochastic optimization.</span></div><div

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=495" target="_blank">00:08:15.300</a></span> | <span class="t">But like occasionally sampling other stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=497" target="_blank">00:08:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a very simple algorithm run again and again and again that has an eerily effective complex effect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=502" target="_blank">00:08:22.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So anyways, I think that's interesting to know because it tells us that you can't control these things as much as you think.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.500</a></span> | <span class="t">You can filter like you can say, hey, before we even recommend something, we can like filter is just like really inappropriate content and just like let's not recommend that at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=519" target="_blank">00:08:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">You could like manually put shadow bands on things like, okay, anything with this category, I'm going to type into my system, like minimize its weight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=529" target="_blank">00:08:49.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're much less likely to show other stuff like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=531" target="_blank">00:08:51.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You can do that, but there is, for the most part, you don't have knobs to turn, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=536" target="_blank">00:08:56.940</a></span> | <span class="t">You just say sample stuff near stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=539" target="_blank">00:08:59.100</a></span> | <span class="t">They like TikTok works really well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=541" target="_blank">00:09:01.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You could keep that on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=542" target="_blank">00:09:02.860</a></span> | <span class="t">You can turn it off and that's it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=544" target="_blank">00:09:04.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Like we do not have the control over these algorithms that people think.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=547" target="_blank">00:09:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So anyways, I think that's an important insight that I want to give.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=548" target="_blank">00:09:08.980</a></span> | <span class="t">There is a lot of these sort of recommendation algorithms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=552" target="_blank">00:09:12.620</a></span> | <span class="t">The math might be complicated, but the algorithmic logic is not nearly as adjustable as you might think.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=558" target="_blank">00:09:18.940</a></span> | <span class="t">A simple routine done again and again with more and more data can work eerily well, and it's pretty hard to have any sort of nuanced control over it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcTh35zptAk&t=568" target="_blank">00:09:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So there you go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
