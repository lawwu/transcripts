because of all the questions Emily might ask, I think she has asked an absolutely excellent, central question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI9sNy2Lf0&t=93" target="_blank">00:01:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This question gets at the essence, I think, of gospel parenting.</span></div><div

for God-given authority, whether in parents or husbands or teachers or policemen or pastors or civic laws,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI9sNy2Lf0&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.500</a></span> | <span class="t">and also see that God's pattern of leadership is servant leadership.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI9sNy2Lf0&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.500</a></span> | <span class="t">That leadership is not synonymous with self-exaltation or pride or bragging or power-grabbing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI9sNy2Lf0&t=129" target="_blank">00:02:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but, as Philippians 2, 3 says, "counts others more significant than itself and pursues the good of others even when it's very costly."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI9sNy2Lf0&t=139" target="_blank">00:02:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In other words, the challenge in parenting is how to parent so that authentic, gospel-shaped young people come into existence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI9sNy2Lf0&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And before I give any particular counsel about that tension, I should remind us all that no matter how excellently we teach and model gospel leadership,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI9sNy2Lf0&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.500</a></span> | <span class="t">we parents are not the decisive influence in whether our children come to faith and walk in what we have taught.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI9sNy2Lf0&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We are a huge influence, but we are not the decisive, final influence, which is why we soak everything we do in prayer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI9sNy2Lf0&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and why we do not load ourselves down with the burden of being God, which we simply cannot bear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI9sNy2Lf0&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, back to the specific question, and I'll make it even more paradoxical.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI9sNy2Lf0&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">How do you model the command to turn the other cheek while disciplining a child for disobedience?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI9sNy2Lf0&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">How do you model love bears all things and endures all things while requiring compliance to the rules of the family?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI9sNy2Lf0&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.500</a></span> | <span class="t">How do you model not returning evil for evil while spanking for blatant disregard for your authority?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI9sNy2Lf0&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, here's some suggestions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI9sNy2Lf0&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Number one, there should always be a steady stream of more or less formal teaching—call it catechism, catechesis, whatever—</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI9sNy2Lf0&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.500</a></span> | <span class="t">a steady stream of more or less formal teaching happening in the home in which, in age-appropriate ways,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI9sNy2Lf0&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.500</a></span> | <span class="t">you are trying to explain what the Bible means.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI9sNy2Lf0&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And that includes passages about children obeying parents and respecting parents and being kind and generous with siblings</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI9sNy2Lf0&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.500</a></span> | <span class="t">and how parents are called to teach and discipline and not provoke their children for their good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI9sNy2Lf0&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.500</a></span> | <span class="t">and how we're all to love our enemies and do good to those who hate us and return good for evil and bless those who curse us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI9sNy2Lf0&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And this ongoing steady stream of teaching will include, over time, efforts to help children understand that there are authority structures—</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI9sNy2Lf0&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.500</a></span> | <span class="t">parent-child, police civilian, pastor-church member, husband-wife, government citizen—</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI9sNy2Lf0&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">authority structures that God has created that give different shape to how we love each other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI9sNy2Lf0&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.500</a></span> | <span class="t">In other words, God has given to parents a role for how to love their children that he does not give to children and vice versa.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI9sNy2Lf0&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So parents love their children in ways that children don't love their parents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI9sNy2Lf0&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">For example, by teaching them, by setting boundaries for them, by showing them the painful consequences that happen in the real world if you disrespect God-given authority.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI9sNy2Lf0&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.500</a></span> | <span class="t">In other words, alongside the thousands of daily interactions in the family which do teach,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI9sNy2Lf0&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm saying there should be a steady stream—every day, virtually—</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI9sNy2Lf0&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.500</a></span> | <span class="t">a steady stream of teaching that provides an ever-growing grid, a biblical grid,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI9sNy2Lf0&t=358" target="_blank">00:05:58.500</a></span> | <span class="t">through which a child comes to understand the world increasingly and all the relational dynamics of the home.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI9sNy2Lf0&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's my first suggestion, that steady stream of teaching.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI9sNy2Lf0&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's number two.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI9sNy2Lf0&t=370" target="_blank">00:06:10.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I think one reason God designed families to ordinarily have two parents instead of just one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI9sNy2Lf0&t=377" target="_blank">00:06:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is that this creates wonderful possibilities of interaction with children that display both vigilance for a parent being respected</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI9sNy2Lf0&t=387" target="_blank">00:06:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and the humility of a parent not defending himself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI9sNy2Lf0&t=391" target="_blank">00:06:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">For example, if a child is very disrespectful to his mother, for example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI9sNy2Lf0&t=396" target="_blank">00:06:36.500</a></span> | <span class="t">say you got a 12-year-old or maybe just a 4-year-old or a 15-year-old for that matter,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI9sNy2Lf0&t=402" target="_blank">00:06:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and the father—and he says something very disrespectful to his mother, and the father is in the kitchen,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI9sNy2Lf0&t=408" target="_blank">00:06:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that father steps over, and she isn't saying anything yet, that father steps over,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI9sNy2Lf0&t=413" target="_blank">00:06:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">takes this kid by the arm with a grip he knows means something really serious here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI9sNy2Lf0&t=418" target="_blank">00:06:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"Dad has a hold of my arm."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI9sNy2Lf0&t=419" target="_blank">00:06:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He looks him right in the eye and says, "You may not talk to your mother that way in this house."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI9sNy2Lf0&t=426" target="_blank">00:07:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, the mother, in the meantime, having been stuck up for by her husband, doesn't communicate a self-pitying woundedness,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI9sNy2Lf0&t=437" target="_blank">00:07:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"Oh, poor me."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI9sNy2Lf0&t=438" target="_blank">00:07:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This makes really sick relationships in the home when you do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI9sNy2Lf0&t=442" target="_blank">00:07:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Nor does she communicate a smug sense of the child got what is due.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI9sNy2Lf0&t=448" target="_blank">00:07:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Instead, what she's communicating is a demeanor of love that communicates, "Son, daughter, I want what's best for you, but daddy's right."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI9sNy2Lf0&t=461" target="_blank">00:07:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, there are dozens of settings, it seems to me, in which the interplay of mother and father capture both sides of the tension</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI9sNy2Lf0&t=470" target="_blank">00:07:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">between humble patience on the one hand and severe rebuke on the other hand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI9sNy2Lf0&t=477" target="_blank">00:07:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's my second suggestion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI9sNy2Lf0&t=479" target="_blank">00:07:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, here's the third one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI9sNy2Lf0&t=481" target="_blank">00:08:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Many families are single-parent families, and many times during the day, a two-parent family has one parent with the kids, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI9sNy2Lf0&t=491" target="_blank">00:08:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">For like eight, ten hours a day, mom might be the one who's got to bear the whole burden of the discipline here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI9sNy2Lf0&t=498" target="_blank">00:08:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So what are some of the ways to help a child see both humility and servanthood in the Christian life of his parents,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI9sNy2Lf0&t=508" target="_blank">00:08:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">as well as strong God-appointed authority to be respected and obeyed?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjI9sNy2Lf0&t=515" target="_blank">00:08:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So here are just
