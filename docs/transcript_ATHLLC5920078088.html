I'm your host, Chris Hutchins, and I'm a diehard optimizer. We're talking spreadsheets for everything. I love doing all the research to get the best experience in life without the expensive price tag. And I'm on a quest to continue to learn all the hacks. So in each episode, I'll interview a new expert and dive into all their secret deals. Whether they're travel hacks, like finding first class or staying at a five-star hotel for free, career hacks, like landing your dream job or getting promoted faster, money hacks, like finding the best credit card or making extra cash with side hustles, or even parenting hacks, like finding the best deals on baby gear or skipping the wait list at daycare. To be clear, this is not a show about how to save money by eating beans and rice or staying at a Motel 8. It is much more about eating at Michelin star restaurants and staying at the Four Seasons for less than half the cost, or even free with points. So if you want to learn all the hacks to upgrade your life and save more, click follow or subscribe to find out when I released the first episode or check out all the hacks.com. Thanks for stopping by. I want to tell you about another podcast I love that goes deep on all things money. That means everything from money hacks to wealth building to early retirement, it's called the personal finance podcast, and it's much more about building generational wealth and spending your money on the things you value than it is about clipping coupons to save a dollar. It's hosted by my good friend, Andrew, who truly believes that everyone in this world can build wealth and his passion and excitement are what make this show so entertaining. I know because I was a guest on the show in December, 2022, but recently I listened to an episode where Andrew shared 16 money stats that will blow your mind. And it was so crazy to learn things like 35% of millennials are not participating in their employer's retirement plan, and that's just one of the many fascinating stats he shared. The personal finance podcast has something for everyone. It's filled with so many tips and tactics and hacks to help you get better with your money and grow your wealth, so I highly recommend you check it out, just search for the personal finance podcast on Apple podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you listen to podcasts and enjoy.</p></div></div></body></html>
