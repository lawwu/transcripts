So typically what we would do when building out a RAG pipeline for LLMs is we'd</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=18" target="_blank">00:00:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">actually take two possible approaches. Both approaches are going to kind of use similar</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=25" target="_blank">00:00:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">components. So let me just draw those out very quickly. We're going to have a vector database.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=30" target="_blank">00:00:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">We're going to be using Pinecone. We're going to have an embedding model. We're going to be using</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=37" target="_blank">00:00:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">text. We're going to be using R002. So that's your embedding model. And basically we would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=45" target="_blank">00:00:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">have taken some documents from somewhere and we would have fed them in through our embedding model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=50" target="_blank">00:00:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and store those within Pinecone already. Now, the two approaches to RAG that we can do with LLMs or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=58" target="_blank">00:00:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">the two traditional approaches is we can take a naive approach. So naive approach is that we have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=65" target="_blank">00:01:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">an LLM up here. Let me just do it here. We have an LLM and let's say we have a query. We take our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=75" target="_blank">00:01:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">query and what we do is we actually take that straight to the embedding model here. That creates</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=83" target="_blank">00:01:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">our query vector, xq, which goes into Pinecone and returns a set of documents or contacts which are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">like relevant information for that particular query. Now what we do is we bring that over here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=100" target="_blank">00:01:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and we're going to merge it with our query. Okay? So now we have the query plus the context and we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=108" target="_blank">00:01:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">feed them into the LLM. It doesn't matter what our query was in this instance. Our query could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">have just been hi, how are you? Right? And we actually went to Pinecone or we went and embedded</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.520</a></span> | <span class="t">that and went to Pinecone and retrieved some contacts. That's why I call this a naive approach.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">The pros of this is that it's very quick. Right? To embed and search through Pinecone, it's like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">incredibly fast. So you're not waiting long. Particularly when we compare that to the other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.280</a></span> | <span class="t">approach. So the other approach is slower, more complex, but potentially more powerful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? So that is where you have like an agent, which is essentially like a big wrapper</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=155" target="_blank">00:02:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">around your LLM that allows it to have multiple thoughts over time, like an internal dialogue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So when you send your query, I'm going to just put the query over here this time, it goes over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to your agent and then it's getting processed within that agent for a while. Right? Another</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">thing that the agent can do is it has access to external tools. Right? One of those tools may be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">like a retrieval tool. So the agent is going to say, okay, your query, if it's hi, how are you?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't need to do anything. I'm just going to respond directly. Right? I'm just going to respond</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">directly to you. You know, I'm doing okay. Actually, I'm not doing okay because I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">have feelings because I am AI. Right? It's going to say something like that. But if we do ask it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">something that requires some external knowledge, what it can do is it's going to refer to its</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">like external knowledge tool over here. And that external knowledge tool is going to point</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that query or a modified version of that query to our embedding model. That is going to create</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">XQ again, which then gets sent to Pinecone and it gets some context. Okay. They get passed back</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">into like our tool pipeline and process internally by our agent again, which will output an answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. Based on those contexts in our original query. Now, I mean, you can see straight away that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">this process is heavier. Right? Because before we even get to this retrieval tool, the LLM needs to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">have generated the fact that it needs to use that tool. And LLM generations are basically always</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">going to be the slow part of the process. At least for now. So, before we even get to that tool,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">we have one LLM generation. Right? And then we go through and we come down to here. We feed those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">contexts back into our agent and then we have at least another LLM generation. And actually,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">if you use like out of the box approaches from LangChain, I think at minimum, you're going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">be doing three LLM generations because it also has like a summarization set in there as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=302" target="_blank">00:05:02.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So, basically, you're going to be waiting a while, but you'll probably get a good result.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, what Guardrails does is kind of cool because it allows us to not do either of those approaches,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">but instead do something that's kind of in the middle. So, this is looking kind of messy already,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">but let me try. Okay. So, we have our query. That query is actually going to go directly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=328" target="_blank">00:05:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">to Guardrails. Okay. So, yeah, I'm going to call it G over here. Right. So, that's going to go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">directly to Guardrails. Guardrails is going to actually use an embedding model, a different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">embedding model, but still an embedding model. So, let me just put E for embedding. All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=348" target="_blank">00:05:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It's going to take your query and create a not a query. Well, it is kind of like query vector,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=357" target="_blank">00:05:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">but it's not using it as a query vector. Right. Let's just, we'll call it V for vector at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=364" target="_blank">00:06:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">moment. What that's going to do is it's going to look at the Guardrails that have been set.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. So, we have those definitions of user asks about politics or define user asks about large</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=377" target="_blank">00:06:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">language models. And it's going to look at whether that query has a high similarity to any of those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=383" target="_blank">00:06:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">things. What we might want to do is if the user is asking about language models, we want to actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">trigger the retrieval tool. Okay. Like our own retrieval tool. So, we're going to say, okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=395" target="_blank">00:06:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">is that semantically similar? And we, based on that semantic similarity, we decide on a tool</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">or we decide to just generate a response. So, we've now kind of done what the agent was doing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">but when not doing that first LLM generation, which is, makes things a lot faster. All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=419" target="_blank">00:06:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So, now, okay, we've decided, yes, we do want to send our vector or our query over to Pinecone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=426" target="_blank">00:07:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. So, actually what we're going to have to do is we're going to have to take that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=431" target="_blank">00:07:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">query and we're going to have to bring it over to our embedding model here, because they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=437" target="_blank">00:07:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">different embedding models. So, we have our embedding model and then we have our query vector</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=443" target="_blank">00:07:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that goes into Pinecone. From that, we get our context. And here is where those contexts would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=453" target="_blank">00:07:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">actually go into our LLM. Now, how do I do this? I've made a bit of a mess. Basically, we want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=461" target="_blank">00:07:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">put those two together, our query and the context, and we're going to feed them over into our LLM.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=468" target="_blank">00:07:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. Yeah. And then that's going to return our answer to us. Okay. So, it's going to come over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=475" target="_blank">00:07:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">here. So, we have one LLM call there. And that is, that's all we really need. Depending on the tool,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=484" target="_blank">00:08:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">we may actually need to decide to actually use an LLM call beforehand, but yeah, it kind of depends.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=492" target="_blank">00:08:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it means that for those queries where we didn't need an LLM call, like if we're saying,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=497" target="_blank">00:08:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">"Hi, how are you?" We won't generate two, we'll just generate one. So, that's where Guardrails</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=503" target="_blank">00:08:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">comes into this whole sort of retrieve augmented generation thing and the sort of unique approach</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=510" target="_blank">00:08:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that it takes to this, which is significantly faster than the agent approach while still</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=517" target="_blank">00:08:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">allowing us to use tools, which is pretty cool. Naturally, just as with a normal agent,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=524" target="_blank">00:08:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">we're not restricted to just using one tool. We can obviously use many tools. So, that's,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=529" target="_blank">00:08:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I think, pretty cool. Now, let's take a look at how we would actually implement this. Okay. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=536" target="_blank">00:08:56.640</a></span> | <span class="t">there's this notebook. Again, as usual, there'll be a link to this at the top of the video.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=541" target="_blank">00:09:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">We're going to just install a few libraries. So, Nemo Guardrails, Pinecone for the vector index.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=547" target="_blank">00:09:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">We have data. This is Hogan Face datasets, which is where we're just going to download some data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=552" target="_blank">00:09:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">from that we're going to be querying against and OpenAI to create the embeddings and also for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=558" target="_blank">00:09:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">LLM calls. So, yeah, let's come down to here. Now, there's this whole like indexing process</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=567" target="_blank">00:09:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">with vector databases. I'm going to be very quick going through this because I've spoken</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=570" target="_blank">00:09:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">about it like a million times. So, I don't want to repeat myself every time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=575" target="_blank">00:09:35.520</a></span> | <span class="t">We're just going to start with this dataset. It's from Hogan Face. It's a dataset I created. It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=582" target="_blank">00:09:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">basically just a load of papers that are either the LLAMA2 paper or related to the LLAMA2 paper</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=588" target="_blank">00:09:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">that I scraped from archive. Okay. And it contains all this information. We don't need all of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=594" target="_blank">00:09:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. What I want to do is I'm just going to create some unique IDs. And after I've created</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=599" target="_blank">00:09:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">those unique IDs, I don't want any of those other irrelevant fields because there's quite</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=605" target="_blank">00:10:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">a few in there. So, we just want to keep the unique ID, the chunk, the title, and the source.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=610" target="_blank">00:10:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. Now, what we want to do is embed that data. There's not too much in there, by the way,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=615" target="_blank">00:10:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">just under 5,000 records. So, what we need to do is embed that. For that, we need an OpenAI API key.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=624" target="_blank">00:10:24.720</a></span> | <span class="t">5,000 embeddings with R002. It doesn't cost much money, by the way. It's pretty cheap. But you just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=632" target="_blank">00:10:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">need to enter your API key in here. Okay. I will run that. And now we can go ahead and create some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=638" target="_blank">00:10:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">embeddings. So, takes embedding R002. This is how we're going to create those embeddings. That</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=645" target="_blank">00:10:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">response will give us this object data model usage. We want to go into data. We've seen data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=651" target="_blank">00:10:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">We have two records. Each one of those records is one of our embeddings, which every embedding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=656" target="_blank">00:10:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">from the R002 model is 1,536 dimensions. All right. Now, what we need to do is initialize our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=664" target="_blank">00:11:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">vector index. We need an API key and a environment variable for that from Pinecone. This is all free.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=671" target="_blank">00:11:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we head on over to app.Pinecone.io. You should see something kind of like this. Your name,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=678" target="_blank">00:11:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">default projects. You go to API keys and you just want to copy your API key. Also, just remember</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=685" target="_blank">00:11:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">your environment here. Your API key, you just need to put into here. The environment, for me,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=690" target="_blank">00:11:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">was US West 1 GCP. Yours will probably be different. Once you've entered both those,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=697" target="_blank">00:11:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">you just run that. This is just checking that we have connected successfully. I'm going to create</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=704" target="_blank">00:11:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">a new index. It's going to be called Nemo Guardrails Rag with Actions. You can call it whatever you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=708" target="_blank">00:11:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">want. It's okay. What we're going to do here is we're just going to create the index if it doesn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=713" target="_blank">00:11:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">already exist. Now, obviously, if this is your first time working through this, the index shouldn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=718" target="_blank">00:11:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">already exist. It will create a new one. We use a cosine similarity metric that is just recommended</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=725" target="_blank">00:12:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">for order 002. We need specified dimensionality of the vectors we'll be storing within our index,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=731" target="_blank">00:12:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">which is the 1,536 that we saw earlier. Now, we're just going to wait for that index to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=738" target="_blank">00:12:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">fully initialized before we connect to the index. Let's run that. This will take usually around a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=747" target="_blank">00:12:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">minute to initialize an index. I'll just skip forward a little bit. We see that our index is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=754" target="_blank">00:12:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">currently empty, as expected because we just created it. Then we add everything into our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=761" target="_blank">00:12:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">index. We're embedding things and just putting everything up there in terms of 100. That again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=770" target="_blank">00:12:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">it's going to take about a minute to run. Once that has finished, we can move on to actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=775" target="_blank">00:12:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">creating our Rag pipelines with Guardrails. With Guardrails, what we're going to be doing here is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=783" target="_blank">00:13:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">using Guardrail actions, which are basically executable functions from within the Guardrails</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=789" target="_blank">00:13:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">colang file. If you saw the previous video, you will know about these. We need to initialize</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=796" target="_blank">00:13:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">one of those functions, which is going to be the retrieve function. We need to make sure that's an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=805" target="_blank">00:13:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">async function because when we are using functions with async generate within Guardrails, they need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=813" target="_blank">00:13:33.280</a></span> | <span class="t">to be asynchronous functions. Otherwise, we're going to get an error. We're just going to embed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=819" target="_blank">00:13:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">our query to create our query vector. Now, we're going to retrieve relevant items from Pinecone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=828" target="_blank">00:13:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">We're just going to return those. Then we follow that with another function. I'm just going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=835" target="_blank">00:13:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">print records so we know when this is actually being called later on. This is going to take our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=841" target="_blank">00:14:01.520</a></span> | <span class="t">query and the context that we retrieved from our retrieve function. It's going to put them into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=846" target="_blank">00:14:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">this prompt template, which is saying, "You're a helpful assistant. Below is a query from a user</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=853" target="_blank">00:14:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and some relevant context. Answer the question given those contexts." That's what we're doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=859" target="_blank">00:14:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">here. Then we're passing that back to OpenAI to generate a response. We're going to call all of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=867" target="_blank">00:14:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">this from within Guardrails, given a particular criteria. We set up the initial, the typical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=875" target="_blank">00:14:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">config for Guardrails. We're not really going to be using TextAdventure here, at least not for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=882" target="_blank">00:14:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">rag component. Actually, here, I will remove that. Let's say I'm a simple assistant. I don't like to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=892" target="_blank">00:14:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">talk about politics. This is going to be our rail against talking about politics. We don't want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=899" target="_blank">00:14:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">do that. You can see that here. We've seen this before. Then what I want to do is define. The</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=906" target="_blank">00:15:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">user is asking about Llama or I think LLMs in general. We can change that to LLM. User asked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=916" target="_blank">00:15:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">LLM. Define flow, LLM. Basically, what this is doing here is it's creating a set of semantically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=926" target="_blank">00:15:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">embedded vectors. What Guardrails is going to do is take our user's query and compare it against</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=931" target="_blank">00:15:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">these. If it sees that they are very similar, it's going to say, "Okay, the user is asking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=937" target="_blank">00:15:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">about LLMs." That will trigger this flow here. Then in this flow, we perform retrieve augmented</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=945" target="_blank">00:15:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">generation. We get our context given the user's last message. Then we create a retrieval augmented</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=952" target="_blank">00:15:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">answer based on those. Then we just tell the bot to return that directly because this answer has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=959" target="_blank">00:15:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">been generated by our LLM. It doesn't need to generate a new answer based on that answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=970" target="_blank">00:16:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's run that. One other thing we need to do here is we need to register actions. We have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=979" target="_blank">00:16:19.360</a></span> | <span class="t">this execute retrieve, execute rag. That's great, but Guardrails doesn't know which Python functions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=987" target="_blank">00:16:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">we're talking about here. We need to register them. Here, we just initialize our Rails. Then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=993" target="_blank">00:16:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">here, we register those. You can see we're passing in that function and we're specifying the name</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=998" target="_blank">00:16:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">that that function has within the colon file. This could be different. This could be get instead of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=1007" target="_blank">00:16:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">retrieve. That means that in our colon, rather than calling execute retrieve, we would be calling</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=1014" target="_blank">00:16:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">execute get. I'm just going to keep it as retrieve because I think that's easier for us to read.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=1022" target="_blank">00:17:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Register those actions. Now, what we can do is try out our rag agent built with Guardrails</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=1030" target="_blank">00:17:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">or rag pipeline via Guardrails. We saw a simple prompt. We're not asking anything about LLMs here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=1042" target="_blank">00:17:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It shouldn't use the rag pipeline and it doesn't. Now, let's ask you about LLama2. We should see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=1050" target="_blank">00:17:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">that it will call. Here, we can see rag called. That means it used the pipeline and we can see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=1057" target="_blank">00:17:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">that it gives us this answer. LLama2 is a collection of pre-trained and fine-tuned large</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=1061" target="_blank">00:17:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">language models, so on and so on. That's pretty cool. It's a good answer. It tells us everything,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=1067" target="_blank">00:17:47.040</a></span> | <span class="t">but I think maybe something that I would like to know here is how does that compare? We're using</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=1072" target="_blank">00:17:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">rag here. What if we just don't use rag? What if we just use Guardrails directly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=1076" target="_blank">00:17:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">without our rag pipeline? Let's try. All right. We're going to do this one. This is a no rag</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=1082" target="_blank">00:18:02.560</a></span> | <span class="t">colang file. It just defines the politics flow. It doesn't mention anything about the LLama stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=1089" target="_blank">00:18:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's run that. That is our no rag Rails. Let's ask the same question. Tell me about LLama2.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=1101" target="_blank">00:18:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">It just says, "Sorry, I don't know anything about LLama2. Can you provide a bit more information</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=1106" target="_blank">00:18:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">so I can help you better?" That's actually a better answer than what I got last time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=1110" target="_blank">00:18:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">which was telling me about the actual animals, the llamas. Let's try another one. This is, again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=1117" target="_blank">00:18:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">without rag. There's this thing called red teaming that LLama2 did. Basically, it's stress testing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=1123" target="_blank">00:18:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the model. Let's ask about that. It's like, "Okay, I don't know the answer to that. Maybe we could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=1131" target="_blank">00:18:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">just try searching the internet for more information on the topic." Interesting that I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=1136" target="_blank">00:18:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">getting different responses now, but still kind of shows the point. Now, let's try this with rag.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=1143" target="_blank">00:19:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. Let's run that. Here we go. What is red teaming? Red teaming is used to identify risks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=1149" target="_blank">00:19:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and to measure the robustness of the model with respect to a red teaming exercise executed by a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=1154" target="_blank">00:19:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">set of experts. It's also used to provide quality of insights to recognize and target specific</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=1159" target="_blank">00:19:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">patterns in a more comprehensive way. That is what red teaming was used for within the training</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=1165" target="_blank">00:19:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">process. Now, let's try our rag rails. I'm just going to ask you, "Okay, what color is the sky?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=1172" target="_blank">00:19:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a question, but it shouldn't need to use rag here. It doesn't. The sky is usually blue</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=1180" target="_blank">00:19:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and so on and so on. We can see that it is deciding when it needs to use rag and it's not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=1186" target="_blank">00:19:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">using rag when it shouldn't, which is exactly what we wanted it to do. That, I think, is a very good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=1191" target="_blank">00:19:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">use case for where we can use guard rails. It gives us the ability to basically create almost</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=1197" target="_blank">00:19:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">like an agent-like tool that can use retrieval tools or other tools like an agent would, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=1206" target="_blank">00:20:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">without that slow initial LLM call. That means that when we are using tools that just need to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=1213" target="_blank">00:20:13.680</a></span> | <span class="t">be triggered rather than parameters, this approach is actually faster. That's it for this video. I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=1223" target="_blank">00:20:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">hope this is an interesting approach or technique that we can use guard rails for. As I said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=1231" target="_blank">00:20:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">we can use this with a lot of other tools as well, which is really cool. That's it for this video. I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMaWfbosR_E&t=1238" target="_blank">00:20:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">hope all this has been useful and interesting.
