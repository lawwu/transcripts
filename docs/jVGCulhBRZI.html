And if not, what is the stack and what are the use cases that AI agents</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=56" target="_blank">00:00:56.280</a></span> | <span class="t">can actually do in terms of automating knowledge work? So for us, a lot of our use cases and a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=62" target="_blank">00:01:02.940</a></span> | <span class="t">of our core focus areas is basically automating knowledge work over unstructured data. 90% of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=68" target="_blank">00:01:08.580</a></span> | <span class="t">enterprise data lives within the form of documents, whether it is PDFs, PowerPoints, Word, and, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=76" target="_blank">00:01:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">as you'll soon see, Excel. But humans have historically needed to basically read and write these types</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=81" target="_blank">00:01:21.900</a></span> | <span class="t">of docs, right? You have, you know, an investment banker or someone, you know, kind of on the customer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=87" target="_blank">00:01:27.180</a></span> | <span class="t">support side reviewing a lot of just unstructured data and using that documentation to basically make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=93" target="_blank">00:01:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">decisions and take actions. For the first time, AI agents can actually reason and act over massive amounts</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=99" target="_blank">00:01:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">of unstructured context tokens and, you know, do analysis, do research, synthesize these insights,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.380</a></span> | <span class="t">and actually take actions end to end. And so for us, when we think about the use cases and the types of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.640</a></span> | <span class="t">agents for automating knowledge work, they really fall into two main categories. There's what we call</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=118" target="_blank">00:01:58.140</a></span> | <span class="t">assistive agents. So those that are kind of more like a standard chat interface. They help humans get more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=124" target="_blank">00:02:04.140</a></span> | <span class="t">information faster. And then there's automation type agents, agents that automate routine tasks,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.500</a></span> | <span class="t">can run in the background, maybe require a little bit less human in the loop, and can take actions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.020</a></span> | <span class="t">that automate the routine operational stuff. When we think about the stack that's required to actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.260</a></span> | <span class="t">build either the assistive or automation type agents, there's two main components. There's really,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.020</a></span> | <span class="t">really nice tools, and then there's a really nice agent architecture. With MCP 808 these days, a lot of people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=155" target="_blank">00:02:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">are thinking about how do I build really nice tools that allow agents to interface with the external world to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.860</a></span> | <span class="t">basically surface relevant context and let the agent take external actions. And a lot of the agent architecture,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.540</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, there's very general reasoning loops as well as more constrained loops. It's basically how do I encode the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the business logic through an agentic workflow to help achieve the task. So for the purposes of this talk,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.780</a></span> | <span class="t">we'll talk about three main things. A lot of stuff to cover, so I'll probably pick up my clock speed a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">little bit. But basically, there is building a document toolbox, which is how do I build really nice tools to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.680</a></span> | <span class="t">allow, you know, AI agents interact with massive amounts of unstructured documents. Two is agent design patterns.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So thinking about just at a high level, the two categories of agents from assistance automation. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.100</a></span> | <span class="t">three is bringing it together in terms of document agent use cases. So first step is on building a document</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.380</a></span> | <span class="t">toolbox. Basically, if you think about agents interacting with tools, and as LLMs get better, you're going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.260</a></span> | <span class="t">have these very general front end interfaces like Claude or ChatGPT. Agents need access to the right tools to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.860</a></span> | <span class="t">basically interface with the external world. And for the purposes of, you know, massive amounts of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">unstructured enterprise data, they basically need the right toolbox to interact with this data. It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.060</a></span> | <span class="t">basically a generalization beyond naive RAG, right? RAG is just retrieval. I know this is a RAG workshop,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.880</a></span> | <span class="t">but RAG is just like retrieval and then one-shot synthesis. A lot of what agents can do over your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">documents includes retrieval, but also includes other operations like file-based search, manipulation, and more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of the points I'm trying to make is that to basically create these tool interfaces in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.300</a></span> | <span class="t">first place, you need a really nice preprocessing layer. So you need, you know, actual data connectors</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.700</a></span> | <span class="t">to your data sources that basically sync data from your data source into a format that your agents can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">access. You know, it could be SharePoint, Google Drive, S3, Confluence. It needs to sync permissions to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and the right metadata. You need the right document parsing and extraction piece. More on this in just a bit,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">but you basically need actual, actually good understanding over your documents, over tables, charts, and more. And of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">course, you know, if you have a large collection of docs, you need to index it in some way. It could be vector</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.340</a></span> | <span class="t">indexing into, you know, vector search. It could also be indexing into a SQL table. It could be graph DBs. It could be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.780</a></span> | <span class="t">anything. So basically, to ensure the data is high quality, you need this layer to actually process and structure your documents</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and expose the right tool interfaces. In terms of the right tool interfaces, this is what I want to kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">define a term. It's basically called like a document MCP server. Again, it's like a generalization of this idea of rag,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.540</a></span> | <span class="t">right? If rag is just one shot vector retrieval, you kind of need like a set of tools to basically equip an AI agent with,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=329" target="_blank">00:05:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, to basically, uh, understand and manipulate different types of documents. It could be, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=334" target="_blank">00:05:34.500</a></span> | <span class="t">doing semantic search to fuzzy find the relevant source of data. It could be file lookup to basically look up the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">right file metadata. Um, it could be manipulation to actually do operations on top of the files, and it could be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=345" target="_blank">00:05:45.840</a></span> | <span class="t">structured querying, right? Quering, uh, uh, more structured database to get aggregate insights over the types of data, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that, that you've extracted out. One, you know, top consideration, uh, when actually building this type of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">toolbox is, uh, complex documents. Uh, for those of you who follow our socials, we talk a lot about this type of issue</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">where a lot of human knowledge in the form of like really complicated PDFs and other formats too. Embedded tables,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=372" target="_blank">00:06:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">charts, images, irregular layouts, headers, footers. This is typically stuff that's designed for human consumption and not machine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=379" target="_blank">00:06:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">consumption. And so, you know, if the documents are not processed correctly, no matter how good your LLM is, it will fail.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=385" target="_blank">00:06:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So we were probably one of the first people to actually realize that LLMs and LVMs could be used for document</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=392" target="_blank">00:06:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">understanding. Um, if, uh, in contrast to more traditional techniques where you use kind of like hand-tuned and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=399" target="_blank">00:06:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">task-specific ML models to achieve, uh, kind of like document parsing over a specific class of documents, LLMs actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">have a much general layer of accuracy, um, that you can use to your advantage and just like understanding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=412" target="_blank">00:06:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and inhaling any type of document with comply, uh, any type of complexity. Um, obviously the baseline</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=418" target="_blank">00:06:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">these days is you can just screenshot a PDF, feed it into chat to your cloud. Um, it doesn't actually give</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">you amazing accuracy, but it's a good start. And so one of the kind of secret sauce, like, uh, magic tricks we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=429" target="_blank">00:07:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">found was figuring out how to interleave LLMs and LVMs with more traditional parsing techniques and adding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=436" target="_blank">00:07:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of test time tokens in terms of agentic validation and reasoning to really get a higher level of accuracy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=442" target="_blank">00:07:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and so, you know, we have a cloud service that does document parsing and is a core step of this document</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=447" target="_blank">00:07:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">toolbox. Uh, we basically benchmarked, uh, our modes where we adapt, uh, you know, Sana 3.5, 4.0, uh, Gemini 2.5 Pro,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=456" target="_blank">00:07:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">4.1 from open AI. And it basically outperforms all existing parsing benchmarks, um, and, and tools out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=462" target="_blank">00:07:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">there in terms of open source to proprietary.

But it's been unsolved by LLMs. Um, if you look at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=515" target="_blank">00:08:35.920</a></span> | <span class="t">document to the right, uh, neither RAG nor Texas CSV techniques will actually work over this because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=522" target="_blank">00:08:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">it's not really a structured 2D table.

Um, it's a pretty cool capability. I'll describe, uh, how it kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=552" target="_blank">00:09:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">works in just a bit. Um, but it's going to complement our toolbox, right? In terms of, uh, more traditional</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=558" target="_blank">00:09:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">document parsing, extraction, indexing, and it's available in, uh, early preview. So if you just, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=564" target="_blank">00:09:24.480</a></span> | <span class="t">take a look at the video, it's also on our blog posts. We basically uploaded that example synthetic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=568" target="_blank">00:09:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">data set, transformed it into a 2D table, and you can also ask questions over it to basically get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=574" target="_blank">00:09:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">insights. And it's really doing the heavy lifting of deeply understanding the semantic structure of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=579" target="_blank">00:09:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the Excel spreadsheet, um, and then using that and plugging that in as specialized tools to an AI agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=584" target="_blank">00:09:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, the best baseline is not really RAG or Texas CSV. Um, those both suck. Um, it's really just an LLM</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=596" target="_blank">00:09:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">being able to write code. Um, so, uh, LLM with the code interpreter tool is a reasonable baseline,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=600" target="_blank">00:10:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">gets you to 70, 75% accuracy. Um, over like a private dataset of synthetic Excel sheets, uh, we basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=607" target="_blank">00:10:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">were able to get this up to 95%. Um, it actually surpasses human baselines of 90% of a human trying to go and do the data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=613" target="_blank">00:10:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">transformation by hand. Um, a brief note on how it works. Uh, it's a little bit technical, um, but you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=622" target="_blank">00:10:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">know, more details are in the blog post. Um, first we do some sort of structure understanding of the Excel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=628" target="_blank">00:10:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">spreadsheet. So we do a little bit of RL reinforcement learning. Um, you know, uh, we actually kind of adapt</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=635" target="_blank">00:10:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">dynamically to the specific format of the document, um, and learn a semantic map of the sheet. By learning a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=642" target="_blank">00:10:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">semantic map, uh, we can then translate this into, um, kind of a set of specialized tools that you provide</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=649" target="_blank">00:10:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">to an agent. And so from an abstract perspective, you can kind of think about it as an agent could just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=654" target="_blank">00:10:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">write code from scratch. Um, as LLMs get better, that will certainly become, um, an ease like a kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=659" target="_blank">00:10:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">higher performing baseline. But in the meantime, we're helping it out by really providing, uh, a set of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=665" target="_blank">00:11:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">specialized tools over the semantic map. So you can reason over an Excel spreadsheet. Great. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=671" target="_blank">00:11:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the next piece here is, so we talked about a document toolbox. Uh, we talked about a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=676" target="_blank">00:11:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">operations basically make this, uh, document toolbox really good and comprehensive. So now that you plugged</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=681" target="_blank">00:11:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">it into an agent, what are the different agent architectures and what are the use cases are implied</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=686" target="_blank">00:11:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">by them? Um, as many of you probably know from building agents yourselves, agent orchestration ranges from more constrained</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=693" target="_blank">00:11:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">architectures to unconstrained architectures. Um, constrained is basically you kind of more explicitly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=698" target="_blank">00:11:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">define the control flow. Unconstrained is like a react loop, function calling, codex, uh, whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=702" target="_blank">00:11:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You basically give it a set of tools and let it run. Um, deep research is kind of the same thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=706" target="_blank">00:11:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, for us, we basically noticed there's two main categories of UXs. Um, there's more assistant-based UXs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=714" target="_blank">00:11:54.720</a></span> | <span class="t">that can basically surface information and, um, help a human surface information or produce some unit of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=720" target="_blank">00:12:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">knowledge work through usually a chat-based interface. It's usually chat-oriented, the inputs, natural</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=726" target="_blank">00:12:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">language. Um, the architecture is a little bit more unconstrained. You know, it's basically a react loop</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=731" target="_blank">00:12:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">over some set of tools. Um, and it's inherently both unconstrained but also with a higher degree of human</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=737" target="_blank">00:12:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">in the loop. So the goal is-- or the expectation is that the human is supposed to kind of guide and coax</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=743" target="_blank">00:12:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the agent, uh, along the steps of the process to basically achieve the task at hand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=748" target="_blank">00:12:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a-- I mean, there's-- I'm sure many of you have built these types of use cases, and so this is just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=754" target="_blank">00:12:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">a very small subset.

So being able to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=772" target="_blank">00:12:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">actually, instead of, uh, providing some assistant or co-pilot to help a human get more information,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=777" target="_blank">00:12:57.120</a></span> | <span class="t">um, processing routine tasks in a multi-step, end-to-end manner. And usually the architecture</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=783" target="_blank">00:13:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">is a little bit different. Um, it takes in some batch of inputs. Uh, it can run in the background,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=789" target="_blank">00:13:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">or it could be triggered ad hoc by the human. Um, the architecture is a little bit more constrained,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=793" target="_blank">00:13:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">which kind of makes sense, right? If you want this thing to run more end-to-end, um, you need it to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=798" target="_blank">00:13:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">not just go off the rails. Um, and there's usually a little bit less human in the loop at every step</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=804" target="_blank">00:13:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">of the process, and usually some sort of, like, batch review in the end. And the output is, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=808" target="_blank">00:13:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">structured results, integration with APIs, uh, decision-making.

And so automation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=867" target="_blank">00:14:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">agents can structure, process your data, and provide the right tool interfaces, um, for assistant agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=873" target="_blank">00:14:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Not every tool depends on agentic reasoning, but for a lot of these use cases, like for a very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=879" target="_blank">00:14:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">generalized data pipeline, um, where you're processing a lot of unstructured context, you might have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=885" target="_blank">00:14:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">automation agents go in and process your data, provide the right tools for some sort of more, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=890" target="_blank">00:14:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">research user facing interface.

Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=964" target="_blank">00:16:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">SemEx is one of our favorite, uh, customers in this space where, you know, just being able to define</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=969" target="_blank">00:16:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of different collections to different sources of data and providing more task-specific specialized</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=974" target="_blank">00:16:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">agentic rag chatbots over your data, right? Um, you know, it's basically a rag, but you add like an agentic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=981" target="_blank">00:16:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">reasoning layer on top so that you can basically break down user queries, do research, and answer the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=986" target="_blank">00:16:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">question at hand. And on the pure automation UX aside, uh, we notice a lot of kind of use cases</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=995" target="_blank">00:16:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">popping up around automate automation and efficiency.

Um, so by creating the right end-to-end automation agent, you can basically encode the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=1019" target="_blank">00:16:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">business-specific logic for parsing these types of documents, extracting out the right pieces of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=1024" target="_blank">00:17:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">information, matching it against specific rules, and outputting the structured data into SQL. There's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=1031" target="_blank">00:17:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">human-in-the-loop review, um, but if we're actually able to do this end-to-end, it transforms weeks of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=1037" target="_blank">00:17:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">just like, you know, technical writer work, um, into an automated extraction interface.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGCulhBRZI&t=1042" target="_blank">00:17:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's basically it.
