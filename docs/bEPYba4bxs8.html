so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEPYba4bxs8&t=1139" target="_blank">00:18:59.320</a></span> | <span class="t">we can see here that the output

target="_blank">00:19:07.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and what we can do now is we take our tool call which is generated by our lm so that's like what goes in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEPYba4bxs8&t=1155" target="_blank">00:19:15.560</a></span> | <span class="t">so the function arguments and name that is being formatted into an
