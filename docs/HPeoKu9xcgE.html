target="_blank">00:00:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yesterday we talked about Billy Graham's controversial associations and the impact that controversy had on your dad.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPeoKu9xcgE&t=12" target="_blank">00:00:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Billy Graham also said some troubling things as he got older about things like there being more than one way to be saved.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPeoKu9xcgE&t=19" target="_blank">00:00:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What did he say?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPeoKu9xcgE&t=21" target="_blank">00:00:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And more importantly, how should we think about our heroes as they age and as they become more likely to say things that are simply wrong?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPeoKu9xcgE&t=29" target="_blank">00:00:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I hope somebody muzzles me when I start saying things that I've contradicted all my life long.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPeoKu9xcgE&t=39" target="_blank">00:00:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In Billy's case, I did listen to a couple of those instances.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPeoKu9xcgE&t=46" target="_blank">00:00:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They revolved mainly around his speaking of the possibility of being saved without hearing of Christ and the possibility of finding a way to God in another religion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPeoKu9xcgE&t=59" target="_blank">00:00:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think those statements were very out of character and out of sync with a lifetime of proclaiming a pretty edgy gospel with regard to the necessity of believing in Jesus Christ in order to be saved.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPeoKu9xcgE&t=80" target="_blank">00:01:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I frankly think we should chalk up our heroes' aged lapses to their weakness rather than to their heterodoxy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPeoKu9xcgE&t=96" target="_blank">00:01:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">At least I want to give them the benefit of the doubt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPeoKu9xcgE&t=100" target="_blank">00:01:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think he spoke carelessly, and I think it would have been wise for his friends to put their arms around him and draw him away from those situations, which I think happened pretty much when that happened.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPeoKu9xcgE&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He hasn't done too many interviews, I don't think, since then, at least not ones that couldn't be edited.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPeoKu9xcgE&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I hope those who are responsible for me when I'm old will discern when I'm no longer responsible as I should be with what I say.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPeoKu9xcgE&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think if you look at Billy Graham's whole life, all over the world, his ministry was predicated on the necessity of faith in Jesus in order to be saved.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPeoKu9xcgE&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think this is his legacy, the simple, fathomless gospel of Jesus who came into the world to die and rise again so that everyone who believes might escape the wrath of God and be forgiven and justified and have eternal life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPeoKu9xcgE&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the crystal clear, resounding message that came out of Billy's mouth over and over again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPeoKu9xcgE&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know anybody who's called people with greater clarity, greater effectiveness out of darkness into light than Billy Graham has, at least not at his level of influence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPeoKu9xcgE&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think in answer to your question, we should be careful not to nullify a man's life work by some statements he makes when he's old.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPeoKu9xcgE&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, and as we close this little three-part series of podcasts on Billy Graham, any final comments to share about him?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPeoKu9xcgE&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There are people in the world whose ministry is such that you try to account for it in human terms, and you can't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPeoKu9xcgE&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And as I look at Billy Graham, I would say the reason for Billy Graham's stunning fruitfulness is that the hand of God has been on him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPeoKu9xcgE&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that's key to his influence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPeoKu9xcgE&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He had a spiritual presence about him, an aura of the presence of God, of forcefulness owing, I don't think, to any ego strength, but to God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPeoKu9xcgE&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He had a candor about him, a clarity, a guilelessness that unsettled the Johnny Carson type adversaries.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPeoKu9xcgE&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, he would sit down with people who you know in their hearts did not like what he preached, and he undid them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPeoKu9xcgE&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">His demeanor, his spiritual demeanor, I think, put a lid on their vileness so that somehow his presence restrained evil.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPeoKu9xcgE&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There was a kind of peacefulness about him, a kind of unflappability or spiritual aplomb.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPeoKu9xcgE&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I watched it, and to this day I watch it, and I say, "Oh, Lord, I know I cannot be a Billy Graham, but oh, would I love some of that kind of his gift."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPeoKu9xcgE&t=305" target="_blank">00:05:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So imitation in one sense is futile.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPeoKu9xcgE&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You can't ever be your heroes, but you can love their gifts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPeoKu9xcgE&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You can admire the grace of God in their lives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPeoKu9xcgE&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you can realize each of us has a measure of Christ's gifts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPeoKu9xcgE&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You can lay down envy, lay down covetousness, receive from God whatever he's given you, and just give yourself to being you with all your might for the glory of Jesus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPeoKu9xcgE&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And pray for your own anointing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPeoKu9xcgE&t=338" target="_blank">00:05:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We need an anointing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPeoKu9xcgE&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I just read this morning in 1 John, you have received the anointing, and the anointing teaches you all things, and you have no need that someone teach you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPeoKu9xcgE&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I don't think that means you don't need to read your Bible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPeoKu9xcgE&t=353" target="_blank">00:05:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, John wrote a letter to say that they don't need a letter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPeoKu9xcgE&t=358" target="_blank">00:05:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And what he means is, when you have the Holy Spirit and you have the Word of God, the Holy Spirit gives you what you need.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPeoKu9xcgE&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He provides a power and an insight and a presence so that you're not a second-hander anymore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPeoKu9xcgE&t=377" target="_blank">00:06:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I think we should learn from Billy Graham.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPeoKu9xcgE&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Ask God for that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
