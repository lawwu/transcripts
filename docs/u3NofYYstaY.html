So we have a crack</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=60" target="_blank">00:01:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">team of ML researchers and seasoned enterprise operators. Aidan, who's our co-founder and CEO,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=68" target="_blank">00:01:08.140</a></span> | <span class="t">was one of the authors on the Seminole Transformer paper. We have Phil, who's our chief scientist. He</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=75" target="_blank">00:01:15.420</a></span> | <span class="t">was an NLP lead at DeepMind and a professor at Oxford. Nils, who leads a lot of our retrieval efforts, was built as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and then Patrick, who was the co-author on the rag paper, which is a big focus for us at Cohere. Fantastic team that's helping us build lots of amazing things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=97" target="_blank">00:01:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's a quick overview of our product line. We have two main arcs, the generative side and then the advanced retrieval models. On the generative side, we have two flagship models, which is command R and R+. R is our work cost.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=114" target="_blank">00:01:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Super low cost model, that's great for most enterprise use cases. And then we have R+, which is your more powerful larger model for more complex like reasoning, tool use, drag use cases.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=129" target="_blank">00:02:09.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And on the retrieval side, most people have used some form of an embedding model. And I'll get into that a little later in the talk. But the re-ranker is something special that I haven't seen quite often in the market. But we think it adds a lot of value, especially to our rag pipelines. So we'll get into that too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So when we build at Cohere, so we have five guiding ethos as to how we want to go about things. The first is, obviously, everybody's testing their models and all sorts of academic benchmarks. But for us, what is really important is the performance on enterprise use cases.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So we've worked with a lot of our partners to ensure that we have an eval suite that is highly customized to enterprise use cases across, let's say, health, HR, finance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's a bit of our goalpost as we ship each of these model versions. And we constantly benchmark on how we're performing at each of these industries and use cases that our customers care about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the next thing is all about efficiency and scalability, right? We're not particularly chasing the race for having the largest model out there. But what we really care about is the practical use of these models, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.400</a></span> | <span class="t">How do these models get used? And how cheap is it? And how easy is it for you to run it as a customer?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">The next big thing is, obviously, customization. As much as we'd like for all of these models to work out of the box, there's always a certain niche that customers want to customize this for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And we offer a variety of things, some of which are pretty intrusive. We've helped our customers with taking our base model and retraining that with their enterprise-specific data for domain adaptation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.400</a></span> | <span class="t">We can do a full retraining of the model for you with your data. And then, obviously, the pretty typical last few layers retraining, which is self-serve on our platform.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Data prominence and privacy is another big focus for us. We've worked quite a bit to ensure that all of the data that we've collected for building our models meets up to the enterprise standards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And we offer indemnification for any IP claims that you might run into as a customer. And then, obviously, we don't ever use any of your data to train our model. So that's a guarantee from us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And deployment flexibility. As I mentioned, we're available on pretty much every major cloud provider. And then, we also allow you to deploy on-prem or in your own VPC wherever your compute and your data is. That's where we'll meet you at.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Cool. So just a quick look at your typical performance metrics. As I mentioned, something that enterprises repeatedly tell us is they care about multilingual, they care about RAG, and tool use for upcoming agentic use cases.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=316" target="_blank">00:05:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So a lot of our focus has been in these areas. These are some benchmarks from Hotpot QA, Bamboogle, Berkeley function calling that our models are quite good at.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=329" target="_blank">00:05:29.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And another example of how we try to innovate is we try to make sure that as we are building these stacks, we're incorporating all of the features that people care about out of the box and they don't have to do extra work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Citations on RAG is a great example of this. For most people, you have to do a lot of work to actually build this functionality with other APIs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=355" target="_blank">00:05:55.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But this really comes out of the box with like coherence models and APIs. You don't have to do anything additional as a developer to build, get citations, which is very important for any RAG-based application.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=370" target="_blank">00:06:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">On the multilingual front, we have one of the best performance when it comes to the Flores multilingual evaluation. And we also have a bit of a secret sauce with our tokenizer, which helps keep costs really low.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. And that's again, TCO is again a very big thing for enterprises and it allows our customers to take that same model, deploy across the globe on with their customers, which is very important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So, switching gears towards the embeddings models, again, given Nils and his team have been innovators in this space for a while now, and we've done quite a bit of work to make sure our performance is great on noisy data and at a super low cost in this particular space.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=422" target="_blank">00:07:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we're actually pretty excited about what our embeddings models can do and this is almost always like one of the top things that our customers are excited about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=433" target="_blank">00:07:13.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But embeddings is a pretty complex space and not without its challenge. So, we try to build this like fun demo where we took all of the archive papers and we asked it a question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=446" target="_blank">00:07:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">When was the attention paper published by Aidan Gomez, who's our founder, and we tried this across like a bunch of like embeddings model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=455" target="_blank">00:07:35.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So, some common patterns that we see is archive is a great example of like where you have different kinds of like data, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=463" target="_blank">00:07:43.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You have like the title, when was the paper published, the dates, you have the various authors, you have like the actual paper itself, and in many ways this represents the kind of data you might see in enterprises, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=475" target="_blank">00:07:55.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So, when you actually build the embeddings for this, you get a fairly complex like vector space and your search queries might not actually like map neatly to this, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=487" target="_blank">00:08:07.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is sort of like where our re-ranker comes in. So, what our re-ranker does is once you have all of these retrieved documents, it's a cross-encoder that helps you re-rank the retrieved set and make sure that that's the one that you send into your context with the generative model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=506" target="_blank">00:08:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And here's the re-ranker in action. So, what this demo is showing you is we search for the transformer paper by Aidan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=517" target="_blank">00:08:37.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you have three different types of like search patterns over here: a lexical search, an embeddings-based search, and the cohere re-rank-based search, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=527" target="_blank">00:08:47.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And the various forms of these like retrievals obviously give you the responses, but they are stacked rank at different places in the retrieval set,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=535" target="_blank">00:08:55.400</a></span> | <span class="t">which means the overall accuracy of your rag system might be low.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=540" target="_blank">00:09:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And re-rank is what's helping you to make sure that isn't the case.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=544" target="_blank">00:09:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">This builds on top of like other things that people care about like chunking strategies, but making those more optimal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=551" target="_blank">00:09:11.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Another impact of this re-ranker is again total cost of operation because most of the expense for your models is coming in from the input tokens, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=561" target="_blank">00:09:21.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you were able to like narrow in to the right context and do that quickly, you could pass in very minimal amount of context to your large language model,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=573" target="_blank">00:09:33.400</a></span> | <span class="t">which drives down your overall cost of like operation. And that is again very important in the enterprise setting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=580" target="_blank">00:09:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, and when it comes to deployment options, like I said, we have our SaaS API that we can help you manage run your workloads.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=592" target="_blank">00:09:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But then we're also on all of the major cloud AI services, SageMaker, Bedrock, OCI, and private deployment across all of these cloud providers and also on premise deployments if that's something you care about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=608" target="_blank">00:10:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So security and privacy obviously is a pretty top of mind for us. So we make sure we're compliant with the standards that our customers are often asking us for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=620" target="_blank">00:10:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the last bit is just enabling like developers. So we obviously have a pretty tight integration with things like Langchain, Lama Index, but we also have an open source like toolkit that comes out of the box with various forms of like connectors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=637" target="_blank">00:10:37.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And that lets you ingest data pretty easily into your systems and lets you have full control over the things you're building and don't have to really look for a ton of different options as you're developing your enterprise applications.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=655" target="_blank">00:10:55.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's it from me and I'd love to take any questions or chat. And we also have Sandra here from Coher, so she'll be happy to help.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=666" target="_blank">00:11:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you very much. Yeah. Maybe two questions. So on the first or second slide, you show your investors and the selected partners, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=673" target="_blank">00:11:13.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So Accenture, so McKinsey. Yeah. Can you explain a little bit like how that partnership work, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=680" target="_blank">00:11:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. And then the second question, like you can skip if someone else like has another one is, can you like maybe without disclosing customers and all, give us like a few samples of where you clients picked up Coher versus other solutions and kind of work?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=695" target="_blank">00:11:35.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So explain where you win right on the enterprise world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=699" target="_blank">00:11:39.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, absolutely. Happy to chat about that. So I think the typical challenge with all of these enterprise like generative AI models is the last mile challenge, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=711" target="_blank">00:11:51.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's so many different like arcs of customization that's needed with the enterprises.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=716" target="_blank">00:11:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's a lot of like traditional like players who've been around for a while and have great relationships with the enterprises, have a deep understanding of like the various like business domains.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=730" target="_blank">00:12:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">That's where the McKinsey and Accenture and all of these companies come in. So they've been really helpful for us to go develop like the product, like make sure that we're able to effectively bridge that like last mile gap with them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=744" target="_blank">00:12:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And yeah, that hopefully that helps. And then onto your second question, I would say in terms of like winnability, I think like the main aspects that has been resonating a lot with our customers is this control over the data and control over the compute, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=762" target="_blank">00:12:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Given we're available pretty much everywhere. A lot of like the customers care about that private cloud deployment, the ability to fine tune in that private cloud environment, which is pretty big for a lot of people and making sure that their enterprise data does not leave their own ecosystem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=780" target="_blank">00:13:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And specific examples for that have been companies in let's say HR or healthcare or even folks who are trying to take their in-house like code and build a custom model that's working with their code base.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=795" target="_blank">00:13:15.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Those are the styles of applications that we've seen a lot of like impact and success with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=807" target="_blank">00:13:27.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm curious for text classification. Well, what is the latest best practice?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=813" target="_blank">00:13:33.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I see on your website, you have a classified endpoint where you build a classifier. Is that still the recommendation?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=819" target="_blank">00:13:39.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, that's a great question. The way I like to think about these things is there's always the arc of like, and I think like Jerry in his earlier talk to this, right, which was what phase of like development you're in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=834" target="_blank">00:13:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're trying to like prototype or you're trying to productionize, and what's your scale of like a production setting, which is important to consider for these things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=844" target="_blank">00:14:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're just trying to get off the ground like quickly, I would say just using the generative model off the shelf is obviously always great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=853" target="_blank">00:14:13.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It gets you off the ground really quickly. When you're trying to like productionize something, that's when I start thinking, hey, do I need a bespoke model?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=861" target="_blank">00:14:21.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Or like the general model is good enough? And what are sort of like the cost of operation like differences and like the cost of like maintenance differences and also the scale, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=871" target="_blank">00:14:31.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Like I mean, if you're going to try to do something that's, you know, tens of thousands like TPS, then having a purpose built like model for that is the route that go versus, you know, a more heavy general model, which might serve other needs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=887" target="_blank">00:14:47.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So yeah, both of those are good options depending on what you're trying to accomplish.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=892" target="_blank">00:14:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Just a quick follow up. If we actually train a classifier with you, is that also a transformer model, just more specialized?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=899" target="_blank">00:14:59.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, exactly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=900" target="_blank">00:15:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, got it. Thank you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=902" target="_blank">00:15:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">No, I think we're done. Oh, no, we've got one more question. Here we go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=909" target="_blank">00:15:09.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Just a quick question. When we were looking at Cohere, you know, probably early last or middle of last year, one of the challenges with the models that we found were the input context size limit were quite small.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=921" target="_blank">00:15:21.400</a></span> | <span class="t">How has that evolved as you guys have sort of created the next, you know, sets of models?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=931" target="_blank">00:15:31.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, that's a great question. So our latest generation models are fairly competitive 128K context input windows. And we're constantly looking to figure out how to like up them. So context window, I would say should be not a problem for like most applications at the moment. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=949" target="_blank">00:15:49.400</a></span> | <span class="t">cool, we're actually slightly early</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=955" target="_blank">00:15:55.580</a></span> | <span class="t">but yeah, I'd like to thank you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=957" target="_blank">00:15:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">for giving the talk, thank you for that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=958" target="_blank">00:15:58.740</a></span> | <span class="t">absolutely, thank you so much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=959" target="_blank">00:15:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">thank you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=960" target="_blank">00:16:00.620</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah, thank you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NofYYstaY&t=961" target="_blank">00:16:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">thank you</span></div></div></body></html>
