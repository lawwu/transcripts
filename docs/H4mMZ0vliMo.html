genes associated with autism,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=322" target="_blank">00:05:22.300</a></span> | <span class="t">and

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=552" target="_blank">00:09:12.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So just the nervous system is maturing at a different pace and can take injury differently.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=560" target="_blank">00:09:20.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So it could be that that

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=956" target="_blank">00:15:56.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Then do that for like a week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=957" target="_blank">00:15:57.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So just imagine even just improving the quality of sleep for those patients can do

right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=964" target="_blank">00:16:04.700</a></span> | <span class="t">If we don't sleep for three, four days, our social skills, you know, we become socially impaired.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=969" target="_blank">00:16:09.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think, of course, correcting, uh, a lot of this issue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=973" target="_blank">00:16:13.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So for instance, many patients are picky eaters, you know, they don't like certain textures.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=977" target="_blank">00:16:17.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So they will never eat, for

creates in the early days, for instance, we thought that, uh, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=985" target="_blank">00:16:25.260</a></span> | <span class="t">there are dietary disturbances that really at the core, of course, it remains to be seen</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=989" target="_blank">00:16:29.340</a></span> | <span class="t">whether just simply correcting those is gonna be just improving or certainly reversing, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=995" target="_blank">00:16:35.820</a></span> | <span class="t">some, some of these

epilepsy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=1249" target="_blank">00:20:49.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And they all have a mutation

of these patients.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=1267" target="_blank">00:21:07.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So about 20% of the patients will get a genetic diagnosis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=1270" target="_blank">00:21:10.860</a></span> | <span

then the rest of the patients will essentially fit into this larger category of idiopathic,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=1293"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=1346" target="_blank">00:22:26.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think on one hand, there's no doubt that the changes in diagnostic criteria,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=1352" target="_blank">00:22:32.780</a></span> | <span class="t">which have happened over time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=1354" target="_blank">00:22:34.220</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, we had to just refine what autism really is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=1356" target="_blank">00:22:36.780</a></span> | <span class="t">That changed,

target="_blank">00:22:45.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So some children, for instance, you know, 30 years ago would have been diagnosed with intellectual</span></div><div class="c"><span

autism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=1374" target="_blank">00:22:54.060</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, about a third of individuals with autism also have intellectual disability.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=1379" target="_blank">00:22:59.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So there is also a great overlap between the conditions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=1381" target="_blank">00:23:01.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's been a move sometimes between the diagnosis over time.</span></div><div

target="_blank">00:23:13.900</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, we don't really, you know, we don't truly understand all the reasons behind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=1404" target="_blank">00:23:24.300</a></span> | <span class="t">We can't explain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=1404" target="_blank">00:23:24.940</a></span> | <span class="t">We know that it's highly heritable based on genetic studies.</span></div><div

highest for psychiatric disorders that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=1412" target="_blank">00:23:32.380</a></span> | <span

can, we don't have the genes for every single form.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=1418" target="_blank">00:23:38.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So it is likely that some of them are very rare, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=1421" target="_blank">00:23:41.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So essentially just think of it as like, you know, they're individually rare form,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=1425" target="_blank">00:23:45.500</a></span> | <span class="t">but collectively common.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=1427" target="_blank">00:23:47.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So it will take a while until we sort of like map all of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=1430" target="_blank">00:23:50.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And then of course, there are environmental factors that we do know historically can contribute</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=1434" target="_blank">00:23:54.940</a></span> | <span

various exposures to environmental factors like in early days,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=1441" target="_blank">00:24:01.340</a></span> | <span class="t">thalidomide, for instance, was one of them that we know increases the risk for autism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=1447" target="_blank">00:24:07.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So of course those are contributing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

undergraduate and in graduate school, there was this prominent theory that a mother who contracted influenza, the flu, toward the end of her second trimester had a much higher probability of having a schizophrenic child.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=1628" target="_blank">00:27:08.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And there was so much said of that and then now we barely hear anything about it at all, although I think schizophrenia is more prominent at the toward the poles where you have harsher winters as opposed to around the equator.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=1640" target="_blank">00:27:20.060</a></span> | <span class="t">But someone needs to check me

that's related to the vaccine debate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=1659" target="_blank">00:27:39.420</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=1667" target="_blank">00:27:47.020</a></span> | <span class="t">There's not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=1667" target="_blank">00:27:47.660</a></span> | <span class="t">There's not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=1668" target="_blank">00:27:48.140</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, there's this open question as to whether or not vaccines of all kinds can increase inflammation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=1672" target="_blank">00:27:52.300</a></span> | <span class="t">and there might be things downstream of inflammation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=1674" target="_blank">00:27:54.220</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=1682" target="_blank">00:28:02.140</a></span> | <span class="t">I think those papers are being reinvestigated under the new

aside for now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=1687" target="_blank">00:28:07.500</a></span> | <span class="t">People will say, well, you have groups like Amish populations where the incidence of autism is significantly lower.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=1697" target="_blank">00:28:17.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Turns out it does exist.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=1699" target="_blank">00:28:19.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I looked at these data, but it's significantly lower.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=1701" target="_blank">00:28:21.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And then people will say, well, it's the absence of food dyes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=1704" target="_blank">00:28:24.620</a></span> | <span class="t">It's the absence of vaccines, perhaps, et cetera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=1707" target="_blank">00:28:27.820</a></span> | <span class="t">But then as a genetic disease, we could say, well, there's also there's a tendency for people in the Amish community to reproduce with other people in the Amish community.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=1716" target="_blank">00:28:36.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's a more restricted genetic pool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=1718" target="_blank">00:28:38.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=1718" target="_blank">00:28:38.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that could explain it as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=1720" target="_blank">00:28:40.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And I raise this not to create any additional arguments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=1724" target="_blank">00:28:44.620</a></span> | <span class="t">There are enough out there between people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=1726" target="_blank">00:28:46.860</a></span> | <span class="t">But just because I think the correlative nature of all this is what kind of raises the opportunity for anything that's observed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=1735" target="_blank">00:28:55.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Like a fever, they get better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=1737" target="_blank">00:28:57.340</a></span> | <span class="t">But as you said, healthy kids without profound autism also talk more when they have a fever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=1742" target="_blank">00:29:02.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there's been so much made of autism in the various conditions that could create it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=1747"

target="_blank">00:29:07.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think it's been very confusing for the general public, even as a trained scientist.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

it's the, the other issue is also that this conditions are disorders of the human brain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=1769"

target="_blank">00:29:51.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I think in children is much more difficult.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=1792" target="_blank">00:29:52.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And in fact, many of the genes that were early on identified for autism were identified in this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=1798" target="_blank">00:29:58.300</a></span> | <span class="t">populations in the

is a very classic example of a gene that is associated with severe epilepsy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=1804"

also want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=1816" target="_blank">00:30:16.220</a></span> | <span class="t">make sure that you don't

that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=1986" target="_blank">00:33:06.860</a></span> | <span class="t">we find the same mutations,

you can correct</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2055" target="_blank">00:34:15.500</a></span> | <span class="t">generally a gene or a genetic defect that we think it's causal. So on one extreme, for instance, you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2063" target="_blank">00:34:23.180</a></span> | <span class="t">envision a gene is broken, has a mutation. So what you want to do is you want to put it back. So those were some of the early efforts where you would put it in a virus,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2072" target="_blank">00:34:32.620</a></span> | <span class="t">you would put it in a virus and deliver it to the patient.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2076" target="_blank">00:34:36.540</a></span> | <span class="t">An adult?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2077" target="_blank">00:34:37.100</a></span> | <span class="t">In an adult or in a child, depending on like the condition, with the idea is that the gene is not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2082" target="_blank">00:34:42.220</a></span> | <span class="t">there or like there's not enough of it.

Of course, another limitation of that is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2302" target="_blank">00:38:22.620</a></span> | <span class="t">that if the gene is really large, it simply won't fit in a virus.

Second of all, it can provide support in the form of emotional</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2585" target="_blank">00:43:05.180</a></span> | <span class="t">support or directed guidance, or of course, both. And third, expert therapy should provide you useful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2590" target="_blank">00:43:10.700</a></span> | <span class="t">insights, insights that can help you improve in your work life, your relationships, and in your relationship</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2595" target="_blank">00:43:15.500</a></span> | <span class="t">with yourself.

Interestingly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2604" target="_blank">00:43:24.300</a></span> | <span class="t">in a recent survey, 72% of BetterHelp members reported a reduction in negative symptoms as a result of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2610" target="_blank">00:43:30.300</a></span> | <span class="t">their BetterHelp therapy sessions.

When I was a postdoc, any laboratory that worked on human</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2645" target="_blank">00:44:05.100</a></span> | <span class="t">stem cells worked on human embryonic stem cells, literally cells that were collected from aborted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2650" target="_blank">00:44:10.300</a></span> | <span class="t">fetuses and given for medical study. There was an incredible discovery, which you'll tell us about,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2657" target="_blank">00:44:17.660</a></span> | <span class="t">which basically made that technology obsolete and also allowed scientists to bypass a lot of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2665" target="_blank">00:44:25.100</a></span> | <span class="t">ethical considerations, serious ethical considerations, regardless of where you sit on that debate. I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2670" target="_blank">00:44:30.300</a></span> | <span class="t">you're using the tissue from a human embryo to study things.

So could you please tell us about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2692" target="_blank">00:44:52.860</a></span> | <span class="t">that discovery of the stem cell technology that really changed the entire game and did away with this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2700" target="_blank">00:45:00.460</a></span> | <span class="t">ethical, serious ethical battle? Let's call it what it was. Sure. Let's start first with stem cells and what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2706" target="_blank">00:45:06.540</a></span> | <span class="t">they are, because I think it's also important to define them. So stem cells are cells that have two properties.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2714" target="_blank">00:45:14.540</a></span> | <span class="t">first of all, they in principle can become other cells. And if they are of the most potent type,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2722" target="_blank">00:45:22.140</a></span> | <span class="t">they will be totally potent. So they can make everything. If they're pluripotent, they can make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2726" target="_blank">00:45:26.940</a></span> | <span class="t">almost everything. And then of course there are, you know, lower levels of potency for the cells. So we all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2733" target="_blank">00:45:33.020</a></span> | <span class="t">carry stem cells in us, right? Not in the brain or fewer in the brain for sure, but you know, in the liver and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2738" target="_blank">00:45:38.540</a></span> | <span class="t">in other organs like in the gut, as we renew the gut, you know, every few weeks that is done primarily</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2744" target="_blank">00:45:44.300</a></span> | <span class="t">through the stem cells, but those are restricted. They can make everything. They can make mostly that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2749" target="_blank">00:45:49.740</a></span> | <span class="t">specialized cell type for which they have been so like primed. Now the earliest, earliest of stem cells,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2755" target="_blank">00:45:55.420</a></span> | <span class="t">like those pluripotent that are very important, those are present at early stages of development of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2760" target="_blank">00:46:00.140</a></span> | <span class="t">the embryo. And of course that happens post-conception. So the challenge has been that you have to remove them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2768" target="_blank">00:46:08.780</a></span> | <span class="t">from a fertilized egg. And if conception, if life starts at conception, then of course you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2774" target="_blank">00:46:14.620</a></span> | <span class="t">interfering. So I think a lot of the ethical debates have started because of that. But you know, in early</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2779" target="_blank">00:46:19.420</a></span> | <span class="t">days, even if you were to do that, you wouldn't be able to keep those cells. It turns out that the cells</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2784" target="_blank">00:46:24.860</a></span> | <span class="t">are very difficult to maintain. And this brings us actually to the second property of the cells,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2789" target="_blank">00:46:29.820</a></span> | <span class="t">which is that in principle, they can be maintained forever. If you provide the right conditions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2795" target="_blank">00:46:35.580</a></span> | <span class="t">they will divide and stay the same forever. Those are the two properties. So, you know, you can keep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2802" target="_blank">00:46:42.140</a></span> | <span class="t">them forever. You can freeze them down, put them in a, you know, liquid nitrogen, bring them out anytime,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2807" target="_blank">00:46:47.340</a></span> | <span class="t">and they'll start exactly where they left. And then with the right guidance, they can become other cell</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2813" target="_blank">00:46:53.180</a></span> | <span class="t">cell types. So only around, you know, 1998, that was that when we could actually maintain some of the cells in a dish. So somebody figured out a soup of chemicals</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2825" target="_blank">00:47:05.820</a></span> | <span class="t">that you can add and this cells will survive because after that point, it was not possible. So that triggered,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2832" target="_blank">00:47:12.380</a></span> | <span class="t">of course, the promise of this field that now would be able to take those cells and derive various organs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2838" target="_blank">00:47:18.860</a></span> | <span class="t">right? Perhaps transplant them, replace organs. Of course, that ended up being much more complicated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2844" target="_blank">00:47:24.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And of course, there were all these ethical debates related to the source of those cells and what does</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2849" target="_blank">00:47:29.820</a></span> | <span class="t">it actually mean to use this embryonic stem cells. And yet we've learned a lot about those cells in early days.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2855" target="_blank">00:47:35.580</a></span> | <span class="t">What are the properties of those cells? And then almost 20 years ago, Shinya Yamanaka was a scientist</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2863" target="_blank">00:47:43.580</a></span> | <span class="t">in Japan at the UCSF, came up with an absolutely brilliant idea. You know, we were always thought</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2870" target="_blank">00:47:50.380</a></span> | <span class="t">that the development, the development of the human or of any, it's a one-way street. Once you go down</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2877" target="_blank">00:47:57.820</a></span> | <span class="t">development, you never come back. So once you start making, you know, a stem cell that is more restricted,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2884" target="_blank">00:48:04.140</a></span> | <span class="t">and then at the end you make, let's say, a liver cell, you can never go back and become that pluripotent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2889" target="_blank">00:48:09.740</a></span> | <span class="t">stem cell again. And that generally is thought to be useful to protect us from like cancer or like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2895" target="_blank">00:48:15.740</a></span> | <span class="t">any others where we don't have, you know, parts of our hands like differentiating into something else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2900" target="_blank">00:48:20.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And he thought that maybe you could do that, not in a natural way, in an artificial way. And that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2907" target="_blank">00:48:27.980</a></span> | <span class="t">of course, would be very useful. So what he did is he went and he looked at the genes that are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2913" target="_blank">00:48:33.260</a></span> | <span class="t">expressed in pluripotent stem cells at very, very high levels. So very, very high levels. And almost as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2919" target="_blank">00:48:39.100</a></span> | <span class="t">gene therapy, because we were talking about gene therapy, he took like the top couple of dozens</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2924" target="_blank">00:48:44.060</a></span> | <span class="t">of these genes and then started adding them inside skin cells. So he took skin cells, initially from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2930" target="_blank">00:48:50.460</a></span> | <span class="t">mice and then from human, and then started adding them one by one, two by two, three by three, four by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2935" target="_blank">00:48:55.420</a></span> | <span class="t">four, five by five, six by six, to see whether any of those cells, once they have this combination of genes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2942" target="_blank">00:49:02.060</a></span> | <span class="t">that are expressed in pluripotent stem cells, would somehow get confused and think that they're actually a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2947" target="_blank">00:49:07.020</a></span> | <span class="t">pluripotent stem cell and then go back in time and actually become a pluripotent stem cells.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2951" target="_blank">00:49:11.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And he showed indeed that a combination of four is enough. Of course, you can have six. And that ended</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2957" target="_blank">00:49:17.500</a></span> | <span class="t">up being what we today call the Yamanaka factor. In a way it was like, it was almost like alchemy,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2964" target="_blank">00:49:24.620</a></span> | <span class="t">right? Where you sort of like, you know, transform something into something else, right? You make out of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2969" target="_blank">00:49:29.900</a></span> | <span class="t">this metal, you make gold. It was pretty much like that. It was kind of like the essence of alchemy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2973" target="_blank">00:49:33.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Alchemy. And it turns out that that discovery was so profound because suddenly you could take a skin</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2980" target="_blank">00:49:40.620</a></span> | <span class="t">cell from anybody and put those genetic factors in, turn those cells into pluripotent stem cells</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2988" target="_blank">00:49:48.140</a></span> | <span class="t">that we'd later on learn. They're almost identical to those embryonic stem cells. And now have those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2993" target="_blank">00:49:53.820</a></span> | <span class="t">cells from any of us and use them for various purposes, perhaps for, let's say, making blood cells</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=2999" target="_blank">00:49:59.020</a></span> | <span class="t">in the future, or perhaps to, you know, model something else out of the body. And I was finishing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3005" target="_blank">00:50:05.100</a></span> | <span class="t">my clinical training around that time. And I remember even seeing that paper. And of course,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3011" target="_blank">00:50:11.260</a></span> | <span class="t">in my naivete at that time, I thought, wow, this is it.

I was doing experiments at that time, studying actually the cortex and recording</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3024" target="_blank">00:50:24.300</a></span> | <span class="t">from animals, electrical activity of those neurons. And always like thought, it's like this disconnect</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3030" target="_blank">00:50:30.460</a></span> | <span class="t">between what I was seeing in the clinic, which were these patients with severe, profound autism,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3034" target="_blank">00:50:34.300</a></span> | <span class="t">and then recordings from the brain and thinking, we're never going to be able to do that.

I mean, I think the, the concern is very real for stem cell</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3525" target="_blank">00:58:45.980</a></span> | <span class="t">injections into all tissues, but when it comes to eyes or brain, and of course, eyes are brain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3531" target="_blank">00:58:51.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes.

I mean, we get a few</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3543" target="_blank">00:59:03.820</a></span> | <span class="t">in the olfactory bulb, in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, a few, but you know, once they're gone,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3549" target="_blank">00:59:09.260</a></span> | <span class="t">that's it. Right. And, um, injecting something into the brain, the, the probability of tumor</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3554" target="_blank">00:59:14.380</a></span> | <span class="t">growth is, is incredibly high. Absolutely. And especially when it is in the brain where there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3559" target="_blank">00:59:19.340</a></span> | <span class="t">not enough space, right?

Vital centers. So there are certainly risks associated with that. So let's talk about the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3571" target="_blank">00:59:31.900</a></span> | <span class="t">other approach, uh, which is the one that you are, uh, you've been embarking on. I'll never forget when we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3577" target="_blank">00:59:37.820</a></span> | <span class="t">were postdocs. Folks, we were postdocs in the same room. It was D222. Yes. Uh, we had a lot of pride in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3583" target="_blank">00:59:43.020</a></span> | <span class="t">that room. We had benches, uh, on opposite sides of the room and we sort of, uh, took over that room</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3589" target="_blank">00:59:49.100</a></span> | <span class="t">as an empty room. This is, you probably couldn't do this anymore, but it was like, there's an empty room.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3592" target="_blank">00:59:52.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's bring some microscopes in there. We just started doing experiments there. And I'll never forget,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3595" target="_blank">00:59:55.740</a></span> | <span class="t">um, when you started building organoids, you started building nervous systems in a dish and how excited you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3606" target="_blank">01:00:06.300</a></span> | <span class="t">were.

Um, tell us what organoids are, tell us why they're useful and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3626" target="_blank">01:00:26.380</a></span> | <span class="t">what they're telling us already about how the brain develops and their therapeutic potential.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3632" target="_blank">01:00:32.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So let's start from the beginning. So around like, you know, 15, 16 years ago,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3639" target="_blank">01:00:39.260</a></span> | <span class="t">we were able for the first time to get some of the cells that are now known as induced pluripotent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3645" target="_blank">01:00:45.580</a></span> | <span class="t">stem cells. These are the Yamanaka. Yes. Or IPS cells. IPS. So induced because they've been induced to become</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3651" target="_blank">01:00:51.340</a></span> | <span class="t">pluripotent in an artificial way. But again, they stay like that. So you can share them with anybody</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3655" target="_blank">01:00:55.980</a></span> | <span class="t">else like afterwards. So we got some of those first cells in those early days. And now the question was,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3662" target="_blank">01:01:02.220</a></span> | <span class="t">how do we make neurons? And what you do is you really kind of like leverage the, everything that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3668" target="_blank">01:01:08.540</a></span> | <span class="t">is known in developmental biology. So we already know that there are certain molecules that are very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3673" target="_blank">01:01:13.100</a></span> | <span class="t">important for making neurons. So all you do is you put those cells in a dish, right? In a plastic dish,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3678" target="_blank">01:01:18.780</a></span> | <span class="t">in a Petri dish. And then you start almost like when you cook, you start adding various molecules on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3684" target="_blank">01:01:24.620</a></span> | <span class="t">top and you see what happens. And we knew that it's actually quite easy to make neurons. That was already</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3691" target="_blank">01:01:31.020</a></span> | <span class="t">known. There've been a lot of experiments done the decade before that showed that even if you just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3695" target="_blank">01:01:35.420</a></span> | <span class="t">remove some of the factors that maintain those cells pluripotent, those pluripotent stem cells will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3701" target="_blank">01:01:41.260</a></span> | <span class="t">start out to differentiate and they like to become neural cells. By default. Almost by default. So it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3707" target="_blank">01:01:47.340</a></span> | <span class="t">actually not that difficult to make neurons. So in those early days, you know, you'll take those cells,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3712" target="_blank">01:01:52.860</a></span> | <span class="t">play them nicely, those pluripotent stem cells in a dish, and then remove some of these factors. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3717" target="_blank">01:01:57.580</a></span> | <span class="t">within a few days, you will see that they'll change shape. And within a few weeks, some of them will really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3722" target="_blank">01:02:02.060</a></span> | <span class="t">look like neurons. And when you look at them, you can even sort of like look at proteins that only neurons</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3729" target="_blank">01:02:09.180</a></span> | <span class="t">will have, you can actually get an electrode inside a cell and listen to the electrical activity. So it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3734" target="_blank">01:02:14.220</a></span> | <span class="t">was very exciting, as maybe you remember in those days. I mean, you know, this bursting curiosity is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3740" target="_blank">01:02:20.700</a></span> | <span class="t">always sort of like, you know, the ATP of the life, the, you know, the life in the lab, so to speak.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3746" target="_blank">01:02:26.060</a></span> | <span class="t">It is right. I mean, it's just like, I like want to wake up, right, and want to go see what happened to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3751" target="_blank">01:02:31.020</a></span> | <span class="t">those cells. And it was clear in those days that, you know, we would be able to make those cells. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3757" target="_blank">01:02:37.580</a></span> | <span class="t">would we actually see any abnormalities in those cells? I think it was like the question, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3762" target="_blank">01:02:42.860</a></span> | <span class="t">how would you know if you derive cells from a patient with autism? How would you know that you found</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3768" target="_blank">01:02:48.380</a></span> | <span class="t">anything abnormal? I think that was like a question, you know, we didn't even know what would be abnormal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3773" target="_blank">01:02:53.900</a></span> | <span class="t">in the brain. And so that's when we decided actually to focus on something that would be relatively</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3780" target="_blank">01:03:00.300</a></span> | <span class="t">predictable. And that was this mutation in a calcium channel, which was discovered just a few years before</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3785" target="_blank">01:03:05.660</a></span> | <span class="t">in very few patients that had essentially one single letter in their entire genome changed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3792" target="_blank">01:03:12.140</a></span> | <span class="t">in a gene that makes a protein known as a calcium channel sits in excitable cells, meaning cardiac cells</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3799" target="_blank">01:03:19.900</a></span> | <span class="t">and brain cells. And every time a cell receives electrical input, this protein opens up and lets</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3807" target="_blank">01:03:27.500</a></span> | <span class="t">calcium go inside the cell. And that's very important because it couples electrical activity</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3812" target="_blank">01:03:32.460</a></span> | <span class="t">of the network with chemical activity inside the cells. And what we knew about that mutation at that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3818" target="_blank">01:03:38.540</a></span> | <span class="t">point that that's pretty much all we knew in those early days is that it probably allows the channel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3824" target="_blank">01:03:44.540</a></span> | <span class="t">to stay open slightly longer, just a little bit longer. So more calcium would go inside the cells.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3829" target="_blank">01:03:49.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Of course, there will be no way to know because you can't get a neuron or a cardiac cell from those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3834" target="_blank">01:03:54.380</a></span> | <span class="t">patients to actually test it. So what we did is essentially we made, we recruited some of these patients,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3840" target="_blank">01:04:00.380</a></span> | <span class="t">we flew them to Stanford. Then we got a tiny skin biopsy, made this IPS cells. This takes months.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3847" target="_blank">01:04:07.420</a></span> | <span class="t">This takes already like four or five months. And then we took those cells in a dish, started to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3852" target="_blank">01:04:12.380</a></span> | <span class="t">deriving neurons. And after about five, six, seven weeks, then we put them under a microscope and we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3858" target="_blank">01:04:18.700</a></span> | <span class="t">started looking at the calcium. You can measure calcium inside cells through a microscope and just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3862" target="_blank">01:04:22.860</a></span> | <span class="t">literally look at it. And I'll never forget that day, you know, when we did that experiment, was looking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3869" target="_blank">01:04:29.340</a></span> | <span class="t">down the microscope and we essentially stimulated the neurons. And you could just see how control cells</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3875" target="_blank">01:04:35.260</a></span> | <span class="t">will go . Calcium goes inside the cells and then it goes out. And then in patients that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3880" target="_blank">01:04:40.220</a></span> | <span class="t">had Timothy syndrome, so in Timothy syndrome derived neurons, you could see how the calcium will go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3884" target="_blank">01:04:44.620</a></span> | <span class="t">and then it will stay longer. It takes longer to go out. So it's like the first defect that we saw</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3892" target="_blank">01:04:52.220</a></span> | <span class="t">in patient derived neurons that were actually not coming from a biopsy. They were not coming. So that was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3897" target="_blank">01:04:57.820</a></span> | <span class="t">incredibly exciting as you can imagine. But it was still relatively simplistic, just a few neurons at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3903" target="_blank">01:05:03.580</a></span> | <span class="t">the bottom of a dish. And of course, for me, what was particularly frustrating was that we couldn't go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3909" target="_blank">01:05:09.740</a></span> | <span class="t">very far in development. So think about the cerebral cortex, the outer layer of the brain that presumably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3916" target="_blank">01:05:16.460</a></span> | <span class="t">makes us human, right? It has multiple layers, a large diversity of neurons. You know, it takes 27 weeks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3922" target="_blank">01:05:22.860</a></span> | <span class="t">to make all those cells in the cortex, 27 weeks to make all those neurons. And we're not even talking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3928" target="_blank">01:05:28.860</a></span> | <span class="t">about glial cells as supporting cells that are coming much later for several years afterwards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3933" target="_blank">01:05:33.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But just making those cells takes about 27 weeks. And it turns out something that we discovered in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3939" target="_blank">01:05:39.900</a></span> | <span class="t">a three experiments done in a dish is that the timing of the development of those cells, it's actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3947" target="_blank">01:05:47.100</a></span> | <span class="t">recapitulated in a dish as well. So if you keep the cells in a dish, they'll actually essentially develop</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3954" target="_blank">01:05:54.460</a></span> | <span class="t">at the same pace. They're not like much faster. And it's very difficult to keep neurons in a dish for 27</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3961" target="_blank">01:06:01.100</a></span> | <span class="t">weeks to get all the neurons. Essentially, they peel off, you know, every time you start to move them to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3965" target="_blank">01:06:05.980</a></span> | <span class="t">another plate and at one point they just die. And so then we thought, how about like never letting them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3971" target="_blank">01:06:11.900</a></span> | <span class="t">to sit down on a surface? How about just essentially aggregating them as balls of cells and then letting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3978" target="_blank">01:06:18.060</a></span> | <span class="t">those float?

And so it was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=3998" target="_blank">01:06:38.620</a></span> | <span class="t">clear, it was in the air, this revolution of actually moving cells from 2D flat cultures to 3D self-organizing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4007" target="_blank">01:06:47.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And that actually unleashed amazing new properties of the cells. So essentially, all we did in those days is I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4014" target="_blank">01:06:54.700</a></span> | <span class="t">ordered from Germany this plate that were counter-intuitively coated so the cells never stick, right? I mean, every time we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4021" target="_blank">01:07:01.980</a></span> | <span class="t">keep cells in a dish, you want them to stick, that's the major problem. So they were actually coated so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4025" target="_blank">01:07:05.980</a></span> | <span class="t">the cells will never stick. And then there were like this balls of cells, they were floating there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4030" target="_blank">01:07:10.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And of course, I remember talking in the lab and everybody was like, oh, they're not going to survive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4034" target="_blank">01:07:14.860</a></span> | <span class="t">It's going to be a couple of weeks and they're going to...

And of course, the enthusiasm of every day to see, are they still alive?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4044" target="_blank">01:07:24.940</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. And then we discovered that we can keep them for months. And this three-dimensional cultures</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4050" target="_blank">01:07:30.540</a></span> | <span class="t">are now known as organoids, which is perhaps not the most fortunate name because it suggests that it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4057" target="_blank">01:07:37.660</a></span> | <span class="t">organ-like. And of course, they're not an entire organ. So they're not a representation of the entire brain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4063" target="_blank">01:07:43.820</a></span> | <span class="t">But that's sort of like the term that we refer these days to anything that is so like three-dimensional</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4068" target="_blank">01:07:48.780</a></span> | <span class="t">and organizing in some way. And so we started keeping these cultures. And then at one point,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4073" target="_blank">01:07:53.420</a></span> | <span class="t">actually, we discovered that we can pretty much keep them indefinitely. My lab maintained the longest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4078" target="_blank">01:07:58.540</a></span> | <span class="t">cultures that have ever been reported, like literally going for years, for two, three years in a dish.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4084" target="_blank">01:08:04.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And at one point in those early days, when I was running out of funds in the lab and I came one day in lab meeting,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4090" target="_blank">01:08:10.780</a></span> | <span class="t">really, you know, determined for us to actually like cut costs. So I've told everybody, go into your incubators</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4099" target="_blank">01:08:19.580</a></span> | <span class="t">because we're spending so much money in feeding the cells and everybody throws out 20% of your cultures.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4104" target="_blank">01:08:24.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And then people started saying, so should I throw the ones that are like 500 days old? And somebody was like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4110" target="_blank">01:08:30.060</a></span> | <span class="t">the ones that are 800 days old?

So then we actually did the first study.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4117" target="_blank">01:08:37.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we had a series of three studies done over the years of like trying to ask,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4121" target="_blank">01:08:41.100</a></span> | <span class="t">how far do they go in development?

And it turns out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4138" target="_blank">01:08:58.380</a></span> | <span class="t">that they actually keep track of development beautifully to such an extent that for instance,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4144" target="_blank">01:09:04.300</a></span> | <span class="t">we discover when they reach nine months of keeping them in a dish. So about the time of birth,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4149" target="_blank">01:09:09.340</a></span> | <span class="t">they literally switch to a postnatal signature really on their own.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4154" target="_blank">01:09:14.220</a></span> | <span class="t">In a dish. In a dish. So, you know, there's this classic example in developmental neurobiology. There's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4161" target="_blank">01:09:21.020</a></span> | <span class="t">this protein that usually changes around the time of birth. It's an NMDA receptor. So maybe some people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4169" target="_blank">01:09:29.100</a></span> | <span class="t">know about NMDA receptors binding glutamate. They're very important, but they change a lot during development.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4174" target="_blank">01:09:34.780</a></span> | <span class="t">They're made out of different units and the units change. And it was very well known that during</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4180" target="_blank">01:09:40.700</a></span> | <span class="t">early development, so prenatal, before birth, you primarily have 2B subunits. And then after birth,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4187" target="_blank">01:09:47.100</a></span> | <span class="t">they're primarily 2A. So if you look in brain development, you just see how essentially 2B goes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4192" target="_blank">01:09:52.780</a></span> | <span class="t">up and then it goes down and 2A goes up. And when you look, they meet around birth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4198" target="_blank">01:09:58.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So very often people thought that it's birth itself that triggers that switch. That canonical,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4203" target="_blank">01:10:03.740</a></span> | <span class="t">it's called a canonical switch because we all thought that it was like so classic. And then you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4208" target="_blank">01:10:08.780</a></span> | <span class="t">take an organoid that you maintain in the dish for 600 days. And of course, we're not inducing birth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4215" target="_blank">01:10:15.980</a></span> | <span class="t">We're not changing media. We're not doing anything special. And no hormones from mom. No hormones</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4219" target="_blank">01:10:19.740</a></span> | <span class="t">changes. Like, you know, we keep exactly the same media, which is certainly a very simplistic,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4223" target="_blank">01:10:23.660</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, uh, you know, kind of like soup of chemicals, but we don't change it. And then you just look at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4228" target="_blank">01:10:28.860</a></span> | <span class="t">this two subunits and you see how like 2B goes down and 2A goes up and they pretty much meet that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4235" target="_blank">01:10:35.260</a></span> | <span class="t">nine months of keeping them in a dish. It's amazing. So that tells us that there's some sort of intrinsic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4241" target="_blank">01:10:41.260</a></span> | <span class="t">clock.

We still</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4274" target="_blank">01:11:14.140</a></span> | <span class="t">don't know the mechanism.

Because as you can imagine, if we understand what that molecular machinery is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4284" target="_blank">01:11:24.220</a></span> | <span class="t">we used to call it the clock.

So how do you do that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4436" target="_blank">01:13:56.540</a></span> | <span class="t">The only way is to actually make the cell types in different parts of the brain, provide local cues</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4442" target="_blank">01:14:02.300</a></span> | <span class="t">there. And then once the cells have been specified, let them move and find their final position. So the first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4448" target="_blank">01:14:08.620</a></span> | <span class="t">assembloid that we've actually made were of a very stereotypical canonical movement of cells in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4455" target="_blank">01:14:15.740</a></span> | <span class="t">nervous system, which has to do again with the cortex. So the cortex, again, the outer layer of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4460" target="_blank">01:14:20.540</a></span> | <span class="t">the brain has both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. It turns out that most inhibitory neurons are not born</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4466" target="_blank">01:14:26.460</a></span> | <span class="t">in the cortex, but they're born deep in the brain. So essentially, all we did is we made two brain regions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4473" target="_blank">01:14:33.180</a></span> | <span class="t">the ones that has excitatory neurons and the one that has inhibitory neurons. And the plan was to put them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4478" target="_blank">01:14:38.540</a></span> | <span class="t">together, hoping that at one point, you know, the cells will like sort of like know what to do. And in fact, that was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4484" target="_blank">01:14:44.060</a></span> | <span class="t">like one of the first projects in my lab, kind of like planning that. And I remember, gave to one of the students like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4489" target="_blank">01:14:49.820</a></span> | <span class="t">this very difficult task of figuring out how we're going to fuse these two cultures. And they're about three millimeters in size.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4495" target="_blank">01:14:55.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can see them by eye. And I thought it was going to be very difficult to put them together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4499" target="_blank">01:14:59.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So the student worked for months trying to figure out like biological glues, you know, kind of like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4504" target="_blank">01:15:04.780</a></span> | <span class="t">using various electrodes and impaling them and everything else until somebody else came one day and said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4510" target="_blank">01:15:10.700</a></span> | <span class="t">like, it's very simple. You just put them at the bottom of a tiny eppendorf tube, which is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4517" target="_blank">01:15:17.100</a></span> | <span class="t">tiniest like of tubes that you get. You put them there overnight. And next day, they're completely fused.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4522" target="_blank">01:15:22.300</a></span> | <span class="t">But they're not just fused. Because now if you look inside, within a few days,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4525" target="_blank">01:15:25.820</a></span> | <span class="t">the cells that are supposed to move, start to actually point out towards the cortex. They</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4530" target="_blank">01:15:30.700</a></span> | <span class="t">literally smell the chemicals from the cortex. And they start to move in this very stereotypical way</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4537" target="_blank">01:15:37.420</a></span> | <span class="t">towards the cortex. And so that was the first assembloid made around 2015. And I still remember,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4544" target="_blank">01:15:44.620</a></span> | <span class="t">it was Ben, actually, Ben was so excited. Ben Barris was so excited about like seeing the cells. He</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4550" target="_blank">01:15:50.460</a></span> | <span class="t">wanted to look at these movies every day. And then he said, I still have this email from him,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4556" target="_blank">01:15:56.380</a></span> | <span class="t">where he was very preoccupied that he kept saying like, this new preparation is not an organite.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4561" target="_blank">01:16:01.820</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not a steroid. It's something else. You have to find another name.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4565" target="_blank">01:16:05.580</a></span> | <span class="t">He loved naming things. He loved naming things. Yeah. And he understood the importance of naming</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4569" target="_blank">01:16:09.500</a></span> | <span class="t">things, not just for like career reasons, although he understood a lot about how to build a career.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4574" target="_blank">01:16:14.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Perhaps. But because naming like Yamanaka factors made sense to name it after Yamanaka. He got a Nobel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4583" target="_blank">01:16:23.180</a></span> | <span class="t">and is immortalized that way, like stem cells immortalized. Yes. But I think the naming is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4589" target="_blank">01:16:29.660</a></span> | <span class="t">essential because otherwise things can get lost in the technical details. Yes. So who came up with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4596" target="_blank">01:16:36.460</a></span> | <span class="t">the name assembloid? So he kept insisting that I should find the name. So I made this long list.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4601" target="_blank">01:16:41.580</a></span> | <span class="t">I still have like the, in my notebook, like I had a long list of about 20 and I would like keep sending</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4607" target="_blank">01:16:47.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Ben one. And you know, like Ben was always awake, like 24 hours. Yeah. He didn't sleep much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4611" target="_blank">01:16:51.420</a></span> | <span class="t">He never slept. So I remember after sending many emails going back and forth and he was just like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4616" target="_blank">01:16:56.460</a></span> | <span class="t">no, bad name, bad name. I don't like it. And then at one point I thought, well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4620" target="_blank">01:17:00.860</a></span> | <span class="t">OID because it's life and then assemble because we're assembled the circuits. So I thought assembloid.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4626" target="_blank">01:17:06.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And I sent this and it says, perfect. I love it. So you named assembloids.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4630" target="_blank">01:17:10.060</a></span> | <span class="t">I named assembloids and Ben sort of like blessed it, like one night at like 3:00 AM.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4635" target="_blank">01:17:15.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that was the first assembloid. And the first assembloid was for cells migrating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4641" target="_blank">01:17:21.740</a></span> | <span class="t">But then the question was, cells have to find each other and form circuits.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4646" target="_blank">01:17:26.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And so within a couple of years, we started making assembloids that will have exons. So the long</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4651" target="_blank">01:17:31.580</a></span> | <span class="t">projections of neurons finding other partners. And, uh, you know, how forgot who said this must have been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4659" target="_blank">01:17:39.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Rodolfo Linas or, you know, who said that the brain is sort of, uh, you know, the next evolutionary</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4666" target="_blank">01:17:46.380</a></span> | <span class="t">step towards movement, you know, so like the nervous system has been this theories that has evolved as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4673" target="_blank">01:17:53.100</a></span> | <span class="t">a way of like moving around. That was Sherrington. Sherrington said, uh, the final common path is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4677" target="_blank">01:17:57.980</a></span> | <span class="t">movement. He was a physiologist. He was kind of vague in a statement, but I think it was Sherrington.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4682" target="_blank">01:18:02.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And I don't doubt that Rodolfo said something about it too. I'm not going to try and take anything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4686" target="_blank">01:18:06.540</a></span> | <span class="t">away from Rodolfo. Anyone that knows a Rodolfo, Luna says he's not somebody you want to piss off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4690" target="_blank">01:18:10.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, we should check it. Like who actually said it, give him credit. I like Rodolfo.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4694" target="_blank">01:18:14.220</a></span> | <span class="t">But, but for us that became like the next objective, like, can we actually build a circuit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4698" target="_blank">01:18:18.620</a></span> | <span class="t">that will have a very clear output? So we would know that we've actually built that circuit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4703" target="_blank">01:18:23.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So what we did is essentially, we thought about like the simplest circuit for movement,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4707" target="_blank">01:18:27.820</a></span> | <span class="t">which is like the corticospinal tract, right? So that means that a neuron in deep layers of the cortex</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4714" target="_blank">01:18:34.620</a></span> | <span class="t">sends a long axons all the way to the spinal cord, finds a motor neuron, makes a connection,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4720" target="_blank">01:18:40.540</a></span> | <span class="t">then the motor neuron leaves the spinal cord, goes to the muscle. And essentially you only have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4725" target="_blank">01:18:45.820</a></span> | <span class="t">these two neurons, right? That are connecting with each other, with the muscle, two connections,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4729" target="_blank">01:18:49.980</a></span> | <span class="t">one between the two of them and one with the muscle. So the simplest of circuits that you can have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4734" target="_blank">01:18:54.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Now lets me move my big toe. Right. Exactly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4737" target="_blank">01:18:57.260</a></span> | <span class="t">It's pretty, pretty long distance. It's a very simple. And of course, like in other species,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4740" target="_blank">01:19:00.780</a></span> | <span class="t">a little bit more complicated. It turns out that in mice, there's an additional neuron there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4744" target="_blank">01:19:04.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So there are some changes that, you know, happened over evolution, but for us and in primates,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4749" target="_blank">01:19:09.580</a></span> | <span class="t">it's, it's as, it's as simple as this. So what we did was we essentially made an organoid that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4755" target="_blank">01:19:15.500</a></span> | <span class="t">resembles the cortex and has some of those neurons. And then we made an organoid that resembles the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4761" target="_blank">01:19:21.420</a></span> | <span class="t">spinal cord and has some motor neurons in it. And then we made a ball of human muscle that you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4767" target="_blank">01:19:27.180</a></span> | <span class="t">make from a biopsy. You can literally biopsy a muscle, you get the myoblast, you grow them and you get a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4772" target="_blank">01:19:32.620</a></span> | <span class="t">nice ball of muscle. And then of course the challenge was that, you know, the reality is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4778" target="_blank">01:19:38.540</a></span> | <span class="t">that we don't know how those cells find each other. Like in development, we know some of the molecular</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4783" target="_blank">01:19:43.260</a></span> | <span class="t">cues that they use, but it's, we're far from having a comprehensive understanding of how they find each</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4789" target="_blank">01:19:49.180</a></span> | <span class="t">other. And I remember we were sitting down in the lab and kind of like thinking, I resisted actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4794" target="_blank">01:19:54.140</a></span> | <span class="t">doing this as the first assembloid in the lab for a while, because the probability was like against us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4799" target="_blank">01:19:59.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Like those cells in the cortical organoid that are less than 5%, the motor neurons are less than 10%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4804" target="_blank">01:20:04.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So the probability that they find each other perfectly and in enough numbers to trigger muscle</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4808" target="_blank">01:20:08.860</a></span> | <span class="t">contraction was close to zero. And yet you do it, you put the three parts together, you let them assemble.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4815" target="_blank">01:20:15.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And within a few weeks, you can actually now stimulate the cortex with whatever you want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4821" target="_blank">01:20:21.660</a></span> | <span class="t">use, with an electrode, with light, and then the muscle starts to contract. And in fact, the more you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4827" target="_blank">01:20:27.580</a></span> | <span class="t">do it, the more reliable the process is. And then of course we went on to like reverse engineering it and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4833" target="_blank">01:20:33.180</a></span> | <span class="t">figure out that indeed the cells have connected in that precise way. So I think what we started actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4838" target="_blank">01:20:38.940</a></span> | <span class="t">to realize was that of course a lot of stem cell biology was, you know, I think a lot of biology</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4844" target="_blank">01:20:44.860</a></span> | <span class="t">was based on chemical and physical factors that we were leveraging, but we've never truly leveraged</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4850" target="_blank">01:20:50.620</a></span> | <span class="t">this kind of like next level of, um, law or power in biology, which is self-organization.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4859" target="_blank">01:20:59.900</a></span> | <span class="t">The ability of a biological system will build it itself.

So I think what we also started to learn from this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4884" target="_blank">01:21:24.700</a></span> | <span class="t">was that all we need to do is make the parts. And if we make the parts right, then the parts will come</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4891" target="_blank">01:21:31.740</a></span> | <span class="t">with the instructions and then the circuits will assemble on their own. And so that has been really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4896" target="_blank">01:21:36.860</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of like the, the beginning of it. And of course it became progressively more difficult to build circuits.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4901" target="_blank">01:21:41.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And so of course, if you put two, you may think, oh, let's make three.

And from the thalamus, they go to the cortex. So this is a four part pathway. So it took us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4948" target="_blank">01:22:28.940</a></span> | <span class="t">years, first of all, to make the parts, um, and then to put them together. And then again, the beautiful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4955" target="_blank">01:22:35.180</a></span> | <span class="t">thing about it is that while we still don't know all the rules of assembly, you can make this four part,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4960" target="_blank">01:22:40.460</a></span> | <span class="t">we call it a sensory assembloid or a somatosensory assembloid, because it turns out that the sensory</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4965" target="_blank">01:22:45.820</a></span> | <span class="t">neurons that we can make are mostly sensory neurons that sense pain stimuli. And so, uh, you can actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4971" target="_blank">01:22:51.740</a></span> | <span class="t">put the four parts together. So the sensory, the spinal cord, the thalamus and the cortex, and you have to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4976" target="_blank">01:22:56.620</a></span> | <span class="t">put them in that order. If you change the order, the cells will not find each other. So you just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4981" target="_blank">01:23:01.420</a></span> | <span class="t">have to create the minimal conditions for them, making the right cell types, putting them in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4985" target="_blank">01:23:05.020</a></span> | <span class="t">right order, and then they'll find each other.

But the beauty of it is that suddenly you look at it and you just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=4995" target="_blank">01:23:15.180</a></span> | <span class="t">see spontaneous activity that arises in the entire pathway, just starts to flicker all in sync.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=5001" target="_blank">01:23:21.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Can you use this assembloid to study the effects of different pain medications?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=5006" target="_blank">01:23:26.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes.

So we very often think that genetic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=5017" target="_blank">01:23:37.580</a></span> | <span class="t">conditions where you have a very clear cause, or so like entry points, like Rosetta stones for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=5022" target="_blank">01:23:42.460</a></span> | <span class="t">understanding anything. So there are these interesting mutations in a sodium channel. So another channel,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=5028" target="_blank">01:23:48.140</a></span> | <span class="t">but the sodium channel turns out that if the channel is overactive because of a mutation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=5033" target="_blank">01:23:53.100</a></span> | <span class="t">you'll have excessive pain.

And it turns out that if you now make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=5093" target="_blank">01:24:53.740</a></span> | <span class="t">essentially a four part assembloid that carries the mutation that causes excessive pain. Now the sensor</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=5099" target="_blank">01:24:59.900</a></span> | <span class="t">neurons are excessively active. So they keep bursting with activity throughout. And then we thought we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=5105" target="_blank">01:25:05.020</a></span> | <span class="t">going to take it out.

To, to prevent, in this case,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=5793" target="_blank">01:36:33.340</a></span> | <span class="t">to prevent presumed transmission of HIV from the mother, which is not necessarily justified in that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=5799" target="_blank">01:36:39.980</a></span> | <span class="t">case. No. Right. Uh, did the mother have HIV? I think the idea was that, yeah, to avoid maternal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=5806" target="_blank">01:36:46.300</a></span> | <span class="t">transmission, uh, to the fetus, you would not not have that, but there are other ways in which that can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=5812" target="_blank">01:36:52.620</a></span> | <span class="t">actually be avoided.

Yeah. Yeah. The, uh, the scientific</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=5831" target="_blank">01:37:11.100</a></span> | <span class="t">community, as you, as you said, um, was very upset about that, which brings us to the question of ethics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=5836" target="_blank">01:37:16.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes. So I'm sure being really familiar with this technology that you've thought about a number of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=5841" target="_blank">01:37:21.340</a></span> | <span class="t">ethical issues that aren't going to occur to me, or perhaps you've heard about things from the general</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=5846" target="_blank">01:37:26.140</a></span> | <span class="t">public or from physicians and psychiatrists. What are some of the key ethical issues that come to mind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=5851" target="_blank">01:37:31.500</a></span> | <span class="t">when thinking about how assembloids are going to be implemented as eventually treatments for disease?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=5856" target="_blank">01:37:36.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So we think a lot about like the ethical issues and we think this as a group at Stanford,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=5861" target="_blank">01:37:41.180</a></span> | <span class="t">that's part of like my center. Uh, we have like Ken Greeley who's a professor of law and an ethicist.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=5865" target="_blank">01:37:45.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, but actually we've engaged, uh, many ethicists, sociologists or religions. We're actually going to have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=5871" target="_blank">01:37:51.020</a></span> | <span class="t">the first meeting at Asilomar this November on the ethics of neural organoids assembloids and their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=5876" target="_blank">01:37:56.940</a></span> | <span class="t">transplantation. And, uh, you know, there are various ways of classifying the ethical issues. The way I,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=5882" target="_blank">01:38:02.380</a></span> | <span class="t">so I think about it is that on one hand, there are ethical issues that are related to the cells.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=5888" target="_blank">01:38:08.380</a></span> | <span class="t">We are taking cells from a human. And so you expect that you have received proper consent, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=5895" target="_blank">01:38:15.020</a></span> | <span class="t">for the use of those cells, whatever that is. On the other hand, if for instance, you put them into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=5899" target="_blank">01:38:19.980</a></span> | <span class="t">an animal, then there are ethical issues related to that animal. Are you doing any harm? How do we manage</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=5906" target="_blank">01:38:26.220</a></span> | <span class="t">pain in the, in that animal that has been transplanted? And then there are sort of like issues that are at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=5913" target="_blank">01:38:33.020</a></span> | <span class="t">interface between the two. So for instance, are there any emergent properties that are arising at one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=5919" target="_blank">01:38:39.260</a></span> | <span class="t">point, whether they're like in a dish or maybe perhaps in an animal, how complex can a circuit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=5925" target="_blank">01:38:45.100</a></span> | <span class="t">like this become? Is there any form of learning of computation? Of course, some people have raised the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=5931" target="_blank">01:38:51.100</a></span> | <span class="t">issue that perhaps there is sentience or awareness consciousness. Are they feeling pain? So for instance,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=5937" target="_blank">01:38:57.420</a></span> | <span class="t">that has been like one critique for one of the recent work that we've done. Of course, in that case,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=5941" target="_blank">01:39:01.820</a></span> | <span class="t">we know, you know, the emotional component of, uh, pain is processed in different brain regions. We don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=5947" target="_blank">01:39:07.660</a></span> | <span class="t">have those, uh, in a dish. So we know that they're not really feeling pain. We have the pathway of pain,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=5951" target="_blank">01:39:11.980</a></span> | <span class="t">but also speaks to the fact that we need to be very careful about how we communicate this type of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=5958" target="_blank">01:39:18.540</a></span> | <span class="t">research. Even just using terms that are trivializing can actually create a lot of confusion. And the classic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=5964" target="_blank">01:39:24.540</a></span> | <span class="t">example in our field has been to call this preparations, this organotor assembloids, to call them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=5971" target="_blank">01:39:31.260</a></span> | <span class="t">mini brains, right? Then it may seem like as a trivial joke that it can do anything, uh, you know, any harm.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=5979" target="_blank">01:39:39.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But you hear that for the first time, scientists have made mini brains in a dish, right? And what do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=5985" target="_blank">01:39:45.180</a></span> | <span class="t">you think? You think, oh, it must be a miniature human brain that they're keeping in a dish, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=5990" target="_blank">01:39:50.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Isolated. And of course that's not true. We have not made the entire nervous system. We can make parts of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=5995" target="_blank">01:39:55.820</a></span> | <span class="t">the nervous system. We can put them in various combinations, but we've never made that entire brain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6000" target="_blank">01:40:00.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Actually, I don't know of any scientist who has as a goal to try to build the entire nervous system as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6007" target="_blank">01:40:07.100</a></span> | <span class="t">an exact replica, uh, of the brain. So I think the words matter, uh, a lot. And in fact, that has been,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6013" target="_blank">01:40:13.740</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, you know, one of the things that we've done over the years, uh, a few years ago,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6018" target="_blank">01:40:18.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I thought it would be really important to get most of the scientists in the field</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6022" target="_blank">01:40:22.620</a></span> | <span class="t">together and start thinking about these terms really carefully. And so we got together, created,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6027" target="_blank">01:40:27.980</a></span> | <span class="t">so like an ad hoc consortium and through many, many calls, one-on-one in various groups, we came up with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6035" target="_blank">01:40:35.100</a></span> | <span class="t">one paper, which was published in nature a couple of years ago, which really comes as a nomenclature for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6039" target="_blank">01:40:39.900</a></span> | <span class="t">the field. We, as scientists decided, this is also like the way we classify them. These are the terms</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6044" target="_blank">01:40:44.300</a></span> | <span class="t">that we all agreed should be used, uh, and not use, not for instance, um, you know, project, let's say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6052" target="_blank">01:40:52.540</a></span> | <span class="t">complex terms onto this. We'll never say that an organoid like sees just because there's a retina,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6058" target="_blank">01:40:58.860</a></span> | <span class="t">right? We'll never say that a cortical organoid has intelligence because that's a property of an entire</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6063" target="_blank">01:41:03.980</a></span> | <span class="t">nervous system. So we think that this is actually quite important, especially in communicating with,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6068" target="_blank">01:41:08.620</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, the public and that that consortium turned out to be an actually great exercise of getting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6073" target="_blank">01:41:13.900</a></span> | <span class="t">everybody together and now thinking, what are some of the common practices that we should all use when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6080" target="_blank">01:41:20.220</a></span> | <span class="t">we report this experiment? So we just had a few months ago, another paper, uh, that came also as a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6085" target="_blank">01:41:25.100</a></span> | <span class="t">perspective in science where, in nature, where we also, uh, lay it out. So like the framework for the field,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6091" target="_blank">01:41:31.260</a></span> | <span class="t">I think this also speaks to the fact that we're entering. So like a new era in science where I think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6096" target="_blank">01:41:36.060</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, you would say all these labs are working separately. They're competing with each other. And yet we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6100" target="_blank">01:41:40.300</a></span> | <span class="t">all got together, you know, 25 or so labs discuss some of these issues, reach some consensus, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6107" target="_blank">01:41:47.260</a></span> | <span class="t">and I think that moves the field forward. And I think in general in science, we will need more and more of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6113" target="_blank">01:41:53.180</a></span> | <span class="t">this collaborative efforts because the science is getting more complex. Biology is getting really, really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6118" target="_blank">01:41:58.060</a></span> | <span class="t">complex and there's no one single lab that can solve all of that. Yeah, I completely agree. I think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6122" target="_blank">01:42:02.940</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, some years back collaboration became the norm as opposed to the, uh, occasional thing. And, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6128" target="_blank">01:42:08.860</a></span> | <span class="t">I always thought that laboratories should be named after projects, missions as opposed to individuals,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6133" target="_blank">01:42:13.260</a></span> | <span class="t">but that's a, that's another story.

So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6675" target="_blank">01:51:15.660</a></span> | <span class="t">the, so like the, the part of the brain that senses, uh, it receives information from whiskers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6680" target="_blank">01:51:20.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And done that, we've done that in the first few days after birth. And it turns out that that was key,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6687" target="_blank">01:51:27.340</a></span> | <span class="t">because if you do it later, the cells don't really integrate that well. They integrate, but they don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6692" target="_blank">01:51:32.220</a></span> | <span class="t">fully integrate. And if you transplant that organoid into the somatosensory cortex of the rat, and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6698" target="_blank">01:51:38.380</a></span> | <span class="t">you wait for a few months, that graft starts to grow. The cells become vascularized by the rat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6704" target="_blank">01:51:44.380</a></span> | <span class="t">They will even receive microglia, the immune cells of the nervous system of the rat start to populate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6709" target="_blank">01:51:49.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And then when you use, look on an MRI, you now can see that about a third of one hemisphere of the rat is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6716" target="_blank">01:51:56.140</a></span> | <span class="t">now made up of human cells. So you can see really from an MRI from the ventricle to the pia. Now you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6722" target="_blank">01:52:02.620</a></span> | <span class="t">may think that that's like an inert piece of tissue that sits there, but it turns out that it is quite</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6727" target="_blank">01:52:07.420</a></span> | <span class="t">well connected to the host. And that happens because the brain is still eager to connect at that early</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6733" target="_blank">01:52:13.020</a></span> | <span class="t">stage of development, but later on is not. And so for instance, you can do experiments where you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6738" target="_blank">01:52:18.140</a></span> | <span class="t">actually record the activity of human neurons and at the same time move the whiskers of the rat. So if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6744" target="_blank">01:52:24.140</a></span> | <span class="t">move the whiskers of the rat onto the opposite side, obviously because the pathway is crossed,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6748" target="_blank">01:52:28.220</a></span> | <span class="t">then human neurons now start to respond to that. And then the, I think probably the most important</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6754" target="_blank">01:52:34.860</a></span> | <span class="t">consequence of that is that they receive now input. They're now in an environment that is much more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6759" target="_blank">01:52:39.900</a></span> | <span class="t">physiological. So when we now looked at the cells, it turned out that they're like six to eight fold</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6764" target="_blank">01:52:44.780</a></span> | <span class="t">larger than when we were making the dish. They're not yet identical replica, but they're very, very close.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6771" target="_blank">01:52:51.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And that for us has actually been key and started to actually understand the biology of some of these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6777" target="_blank">01:52:57.020</a></span> | <span class="t">conditions. So for instance, for Timothy syndrome, there is a very dramatic effect in the size of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6784" target="_blank">01:53:04.700</a></span> | <span class="t">the neurons. They're almost twice as smaller than a control neuron.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6789" target="_blank">01:53:09.260</a></span> | <span class="t">In the patient. Well, in the patient, only when you transplant the cells, we can see that defect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6795" target="_blank">01:53:15.020</a></span> | <span class="t">In a dish, you look at them and they're identical. And then you transplant them and some of them grow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6799" target="_blank">01:53:19.740</a></span> | <span class="t">really large to control and the patients fail. And that phenotype can only really be seen properly in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6805" target="_blank">01:53:25.420</a></span> | <span class="t">vivo. So that has been actually essential also, as we've been developing a therapeutic for this condition.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6811" target="_blank">01:53:31.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And you start thinking like, how do you test a therapeutic? You know, if there's no animal model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6816" target="_blank">01:53:36.060</a></span> | <span class="t">of the disease, you test everything in a dish. You do want to have some safety check, first of all,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6823" target="_blank">01:53:43.180</a></span> | <span class="t">for making sure that there are no adverse effects, but also you want to make sure that it works in an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6826" target="_blank">01:53:46.940</a></span> | <span class="t">in vivo environment. And actually it turns out that this model that we've built was essential</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6832" target="_blank">01:53:52.220</a></span> | <span class="t">because now we could take actually the animal and inject the therapeutic into the nervous system of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6838" target="_blank">01:53:58.860</a></span> | <span class="t">the animal, but look at the effect on human neurons in an in vivo context. And, uh, you know, so I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6845" target="_blank">01:54:05.100</a></span> | <span class="t">that's one application for this, but if you do the transplantation at a later stage, like for instance,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6850" target="_blank">01:54:10.140</a></span> | <span class="t">in an adult, that integration will probably not happen. I see. So it's quite dependent on the species.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6855" target="_blank">01:54:15.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's another thing, the farther away the species are, the less likely it is, of course,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6862" target="_blank">01:54:22.940</a></span> | <span class="t">that the cells will integrate. So, you know, think about it. It takes just a couple of weeks for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6868" target="_blank">01:54:28.700</a></span> | <span class="t">rats to make the cortex. It takes us 20 weeks to make most of the cortical cells. So the human cells</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6875" target="_blank">01:54:35.660</a></span> | <span class="t">are always behind. The rat is finishing development very quickly. The humans are trying, but they're keeping</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6881" target="_blank">01:54:41.580</a></span> | <span class="t">their pace. So the integration between the two species happens at some level, but it's not perfect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6886" target="_blank">01:54:46.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's actually not our goal. Our goal has never really been to have perfect integration. All we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6891" target="_blank">01:54:51.500</a></span> | <span class="t">wanted to do is to have a better system where we can capture aspects of disease that we wouldn't be able</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6896" target="_blank">01:54:56.700</a></span> | <span class="t">to see in another way or test therapeutics that we wouldn't be able to test in any other way. And so that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6901" target="_blank">01:55:01.740</a></span> | <span class="t">where this actually comes in handy and it's been very useful. It's so interesting that for most people,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6909" target="_blank">01:55:09.100</a></span> | <span class="t">again, I'm making a lot of assumptions here, but for most people, the idea of a chip of a, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6915" target="_blank">01:55:15.900</a></span> | <span class="t">electrode implanted into the brain of a patient or spinal cord of a patient, isn't that disturbing to them?

Although</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=6986" target="_blank">01:56:26.860</a></span> | <span class="t">typically we think of that stuff as in the brain.

And that raises a question for me. You mentioned that there are many genes that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=7027" target="_blank">01:57:07.180</a></span> | <span class="t">are associated with autism.

So another one that we're studying now, there are forms of epilepsy,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=7607" target="_blank">02:06:47.500</a></span> | <span class="t">which are very difficult to study.

So there are really devastating conditions that are actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=7623" target="_blank">02:07:03.820</a></span> | <span class="t">causing impairment just by having those seizures every single day for 10, 15 years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=7628" target="_blank">02:07:08.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And so those are a really big issue right now. So we've been focusing a lot on trying to build our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=7634" target="_blank">02:07:14.940</a></span> | <span class="t">models for this epileptic seizures, either through in vitro studies or after we transplant. And then we study</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=7641" target="_blank">02:07:21.500</a></span> | <span class="t">more complex networks in patients. And then of course, intellectual disability, so severe intellectual</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=7647" target="_blank">02:07:27.260</a></span> | <span class="t">disability, schizophrenia, forms of schizophrenia. So we've been studying now for almost 12, 13 years,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=7653" target="_blank">02:07:33.820</a></span> | <span class="t">22Q11 deletion syndrome. We think it's like an entry point. It's the highest genetic risk factor</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=7660" target="_blank">02:07:40.860</a></span> | <span class="t">that we know of for schizophrenia. So we think it may give us some windows into how molecular defects</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=7667" target="_blank">02:07:47.580</a></span> | <span class="t">arise. So I think you can think of most psychiatric and neurological conditions that you can study now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=7674" target="_blank">02:07:54.060</a></span> | <span class="t">as long as they have a strong biological genetic component.

And so we do know a little bit about the biology behind it. We do know that the basal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=7823" target="_blank">02:10:23.420</a></span> | <span class="t">ganglia, this deep structure into the brain is very important for movements. You know, we very often</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=7828" target="_blank">02:10:28.700</a></span> | <span class="t">stimulate that brain region for Parkinson's disease or parts, you know, of those circuitry. So we know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=7834" target="_blank">02:10:34.060</a></span> | <span class="t">it's very important. So we've been trying to rebuild it in a dish. So we now can build some of the circuits,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=7839" target="_blank">02:10:39.340</a></span> | <span class="t">we call them loop assembloids, where essentially you can put a cortex and we've made the striatum and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=7844" target="_blank">02:10:44.300</a></span> | <span class="t">then you put parts of the mesencephalon and the midbrain and the thalamus and the cells connect in a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=7848" target="_blank">02:10:48.780</a></span> | <span class="t">loop and now they have activity. So you can now induce mutations at various levels of the circuit and see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=7855" target="_blank">02:10:55.260</a></span> | <span class="t">where is that mutation most important. So let's say if you were to develop a gene therapy, where would you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=7860" target="_blank">02:11:00.620</a></span> | <span class="t">deliver that gene, right? If you were to choose, if you can deliver it in the entire brain. So these are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=7865" target="_blank">02:11:05.820</a></span> | <span class="t">really, so like early days, but I think the, uh, it can be applied. And I think in general, you know, you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=7871" target="_blank">02:11:11.900</a></span> | <span class="t">mentioning this before about autism, right?

I think when I refer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=7883" target="_blank">02:11:23.420</a></span> | <span class="t">to autism, I generally refer to the severe forms and profound autism.

There are,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=7897" target="_blank">02:11:37.100</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, uh, uh, they have high skills.

The ones</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=7917" target="_blank">02:11:57.980</a></span> | <span class="t">that actually the parents are still struggling to even communicate about, right? The kids who may never go to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4mMZ0vliMo&t=7922" target="_blank">02:12:02.940</a></span> | <span class="t">school may, uh, never be able to actually live on their own.
