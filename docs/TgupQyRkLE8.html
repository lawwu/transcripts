href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=29" target="_blank">00:00:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Christians were gathering in remote places and homes,</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=67" target="_blank">00:01:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">who single-handedly took the printing press from an economically perilous side industry</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=72" target="_blank">00:01:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to one of the central economic

Luther was able to first popularize theological works for the laity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=81" target="_blank">00:01:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He translated the Bible into the language of the people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He also mastered the art of writing in the vernacular of his day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=88" target="_blank">00:01:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And he mastered a style of short-form writing that exploded his popularity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=93" target="_blank">00:01:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In every area, it seems, Luther proved himself to be a publishing pioneer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=99" target="_blank">00:01:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that incredible story is now told in an excellent new book by historian Dr. Andrew Pettigree.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I talked with him recently and today our conversation is being released in the Aspester John podcast series.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=111" target="_blank">00:01:51.000</a></span> | <span

books, but today we talk about his fascinating book that he wrote entitled,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=124"

exaggerated, it's not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, one of the things I most appreciate about Dr. Pettigree is his willingness to demythologize Luther when appropriate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Going so far as to suggest instead of the famous 95 Theses being nailed to the castle church door by a hammer in Luther's hand,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it was more likely gently stuck to the door with glue, and even possibly at the hands of a university assistant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So to begin this interview, I asked Dr. Pettigree to explain his radical view of Luther's mythic moment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, I'm taking quite a moderate middle way in suggesting that this was glued up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because back in the '50s, a historian started a real controversy by suggesting the 95 Theses weren't displayed on the church door of Wittenberg at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm inclined to reject that, and the reason is that exhibiting Theses on the university notice board,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">which is exactly what the church door at Wittenberg was at this time, was so routine an operation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that it's quite normal that nobody would have stated that they had witnessed this at the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I don't think the fact that no one came forward in 1517 to say, "I saw Luther sticking them up," is all that material.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We're also helped by the discovery, relatively recently, of a single surviving copy of his Theses on Scholastic Theology,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">which he put forward six weeks before the Theses on Indulgences, which completely bombed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And these were known only from a much later version until this turned up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's not unusual.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">These sorts of fugitive pieces, broad sheets, single sheets printed on one side only, very often don't survive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They survive only in small numbers, and many editions have just simply been lost altogether.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if Luther's original version of the Ninety-Five Theses has been lost, which I'm pretty certain it has,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that's not extraordinary in itself, and I'm pretty sure they were stuck up in this way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And because so many pieces of paper would have been stuck up, pasted on top of each other,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the use of a nail would soon have destroyed the door.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that really is a romantic invention of the 19th century.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">- Well, yeah, not so ringing or dramatic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We've gotten ahead of ourselves, and it's my fault in this interview.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.000</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:05:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It seems to be a most unlikely backdrop for the drama that will follow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Sketch the story for us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">How unlikely of a place was it to become the epicenter of cultural transformation and mass media?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=319" target="_blank">00:05:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">- Well, life was pretty slow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=322" target="_blank">00:05:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Wittenberg was a relatively tiny place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It probably had only about 2,000 inhabitants then,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and it was regarded, not least by Luther himself, as very much on the fringes of civilization.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It was further north and east than other of the great cities of North Germany,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=347" target="_blank">00:05:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">like Erfurt and Leipzig.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It was out of the way.

sophistication as there was, was to be found in these larger places,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=358" target="_blank">00:05:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">principally Leipzig, the established university town,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=512" target="_blank">00:08:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Books existed already.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=514" target="_blank">00:08:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Mostly they were handwritten manuscripts in academic libraries.</span></div><div

universities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=520" target="_blank">00:08:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Prior to Luther, what was the printing press used for during this early era?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=526" target="_blank">00:08:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, yes, it's a good thing to start with the reflection that medieval Europe was already full of books,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=534" target="_blank">00:08:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">handwritten books, which were often very beautiful and were very flexible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=540" target="_blank">00:09:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is one of the things about the manuscript.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=543" target="_blank">00:09:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Basically, the owner of a text would pretty much decide the contents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=548" target="_blank">00:09:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They didn't need to have the whole of a book copied for them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=551" target="_blank">00:09:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They could have the bits they wanted.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=553" target="_blank">00:09:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They could then put it in a volume with other bits from other books.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=557" target="_blank">00:09:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it was a very flexible medium.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=559" target="_blank">00:09:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It also facilitated decoration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=562" target="_blank">00:09:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So when printing came along, it wasn't immediately obvious to the existing owners of manuscripts that they'd be much better off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=573" target="_blank">00:09:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The new medium of print, Gutenberg really solved the technical difficulties of printing very, very early.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=586" target="_blank">00:09:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It was a masterpiece of technology, but it proved to be a very difficult sale.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=594" target="_blank">00:09:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because here you have, instead of having one copy of a manuscript,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=601" target="_blank">00:10:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">which has been desired by the person who brings it into being,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=606" target="_blank">00:10:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you have two or three hundred copies, probably even more,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=610" target="_blank">00:10:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">which had now to be sold to people who, until that moment, hadn't even known that they wanted it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=616" target="_blank">00:10:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Furthermore, those two or three hundred people might be spread all around Europe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=623" target="_blank">00:10:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And furthermore, instead of the multicolored object that was their manuscript book,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=630" target="_blank">00:10:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">they were being offered something in black and white.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=634" target="_blank">00:10:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In many respects, this represented a step backwards for book culture rather than a step forwards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=641" target="_blank">00:10:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's important to recognize that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=643" target="_blank">00:10:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because the publishers of the first books very often went bankrupt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=648" target="_blank">00:10:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Gutenberg's the shining example, but it happens over and over again in Europe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=653" target="_blank">00:10:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because they now had too many books which they wanted to sell to too few people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=659" target="_blank">00:10:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So in order for books to survive, in order for print to survive as a technology,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=664" target="_blank">00:11:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">they had to find a way to reach new markets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=669" target="_blank">00:11:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this happened in two stages.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=671" target="_blank">00:11:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">First of all, it turned out that the ruling powers, the church and the governors of Germany and elsewhere,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=681" target="_blank">00:11:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">were print's best friend, because they provided lots of regular work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=685" target="_blank">00:11:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Furthermore, this was work which was often being done for a single client who would pay for the whole job.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=691" target="_blank">00:11:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Instead of having these two or three hundred copies for complex Latin text to sell to people all over Europe,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=699" target="_blank">00:11:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the local print's would come in and say, "I need two hundred copies of an ordinance against beggars."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=707" target="_blank">00:11:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you print this up for them, his secretary would come and get it, and you'd get paid.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=713" target="_blank">00:11:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it was the ideal job for a printer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=716" target="_blank">00:11:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The church too was a very good client, not least in its sale of indulgences.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=723" target="_blank">00:12:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because the indulgence sales required enormous amounts of print.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=728" target="_blank">00:12:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Sermons, announcements, copies of the papal bull, and most of all, the indulgence certificates themselves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=735" target="_blank">00:12:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So one of the ironies of Luther's movement is that he was attacking one of the major sources of income of the print industry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=742" target="_blank">00:12:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And he had therefore to be a better bet for them than what he was urging them to discontinue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=750" target="_blank">00:12:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this worked. A lot of the people who printed for Luther had in the years before the Reformation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=756" target="_blank">00:12:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">printed for the church and printed indulgences.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=760" target="_blank">00:12:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So what the Reformation does, and why this is critical to the history of printing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=765" target="_blank">00:12:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is it inculcates the habit of buying books into many people who would not previously have owned books,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=775" target="_blank">00:12:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and certainly not have owned a collection of books.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=778" target="_blank">00:12:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And Luther managed this by his instinctive sense that it was a way to present theology in German to a wider audience in short texts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=790" target="_blank">00:13:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And all of these things were new, and together they were a revolutionary cocktail.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=797" target="_blank">00:13:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Incredible. I mean, that's such a fascinating story.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=801" target="_blank">00:13:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I want to talk about indulgences a little later, but I want to underline this point here because I think we take it for granted.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=808" target="_blank">00:13:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Luther's use of the printing press brought about the new need to sell books to people who didn't know what was inside of the book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=816" target="_blank">00:13:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that meant broadening the market.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=819" target="_blank">00:13:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So what drew new book buyers to Luther's works?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=824" target="_blank">00:13:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's right at the beginning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=826" target="_blank">00:13:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And what would have sold the books to these people is the scandal of Luther,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=832" target="_blank">00:13:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the sense that was buzzing around the news world that something very odd was going on in this tiny place in North Germany,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=840" target="_blank">00:14:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and this monk was standing up against the whole church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=843" target="_blank">00:14:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think what attracted people to Luther was, first of all, curiosity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=848" target="_blank">00:14:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, it's also true that for Luther's protest to become a movement, it needed other people to join in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=856" target="_blank">00:14:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was because ministers would stand up in their own pulpits, priests would stand up in their own pulpit and say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=863" target="_blank">00:14:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"You've heard of this man Martin Luther, and I have to tell you that what he's teaching is right, and his criticisms of the church are justified."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=873" target="_blank">00:14:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The Reformation actually doesn't really establish itself successfully in many places where there isn't a local minister preaching in support of Luther.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=885" target="_blank">00:14:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's where Luther's Latin works are important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=889" target="_blank">00:14:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He's still a very effective Latin writer, and that is persuading his fellow priests that his criticisms are justified.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=897" target="_blank">00:14:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then this has a sort of snowball effect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=899" target="_blank">00:14:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Once their respected local preacher is preaching in this way, people begin to go out, buy Luther's works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=908" target="_blank">00:15:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And once they buy one, they buy many.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=910" target="_blank">00:15:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because one of the things about Luther is he writes an extraordinary number of different original works in this first five years of the Reformation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=920"

Strausberg.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=933" target="_blank">00:15:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So they ricochet in this way around all of the major printing centers of Germany.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=938" target="_blank">00:15:38.000</a></span>

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=956" target="_blank">00:15:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it also becomes, as people become more convinced of Luther, a way in which people can make a token, if you like, of allegiance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=966" target="_blank">00:16:06.000</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=976" target="_blank">00:16:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And you respect him and you worry about his fate.</span></div><div class="c"><span

first years of the Reformation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=988" target="_blank">00:16:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you

<span class="t">I've said before, it's almost like buying the program when you go to a major sports event.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1000" target="_blank">00:16:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not as if by buying the program you can affect the outcome of what's going to happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1007" target="_blank">00:16:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But it is a way of signaling allegiance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1011" target="_blank">00:16:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think books become in this way badges of identity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1016" target="_blank">00:16:56.000</a></span> | <span

Gutenberg himself, as I understand it, was a devout Roman Catholic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1021" target="_blank">00:17:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">As you mentioned earlier, his printing press was employed by the church to churn out certificates of indulgences.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1029" target="_blank">00:17:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So now take us forward to 1517.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1032" target="_blank">00:17:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Luther was a preacher in Wittenberg.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1034" target="_blank">00:17:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now in 1517 or thereabouts, he launches his brand, as you call it, in using the printing press.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1040" target="_blank">00:17:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And in a nutshell, how did Luther pull together his press to support his ambitions from the very rudimentary printing press that was available to him locally?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1052" target="_blank">00:17:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, this is actually quite difficult, and this is one of the major obstacles to the spread of the Reformation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1059" target="_blank">00:17:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The first press isn't established in Wittenberg until 1502.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1066" target="_blank">00:17:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's right at the beginning of the university and a full 50 years since printing had been operating in other parts of Germany.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1075" target="_blank">00:17:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Until that point, any books required in this small place would have been supplied from either Erfurt or from Leipzig.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1086" target="_blank">00:18:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And to be honest, things didn't much change.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1089" target="_blank">00:18:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think in the first 15 years of the press, this one single press, which goes through several pairs of hands, is turning out fewer than 10 works a year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1101" target="_blank">00:18:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Most of these are very small, so it wouldn't even have been fully occupied.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1107" target="_blank">00:18:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The works were of quite a rudimentary quality, and even the professors, if they wanted something done which was more serious, wouldn't use the Wittenberg press to do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1121" target="_blank">00:18:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It wasn't very loyal, but it was a mark that academic ambition doesn't always go with local loyalty.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1131" target="_blank">00:18:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so when Luther came along, he did use the local printer, Johannes Raugrünnenberg, but it simply wasn't satisfactory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1144" target="_blank">00:19:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Raugrünnenberg had a single press, he was rather slow, he was rather deliberate, and though he was a faithful supporter of Luther, and Luther was quite faithful to him too,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1156" target="_blank">00:19:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">he simply couldn't keep up with the pace of events, and Luther was forced to send books to Leipzig to get them printed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1165" target="_blank">00:19:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, in the first days of the Reformation, this worked by this sort of ricochet effect I've been describing, that Raugrünnenberg's first editions were reprinted quickly elsewhere,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1178" target="_blank">00:19:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and this was quite an effective way of spreading the word.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1182" target="_blank">00:19:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But Luther realized that he just couldn't stay like this, that he had to have a better source of printing in Wittenberg.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1191" target="_blank">00:19:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So he actually took the personal initiative of ensuring that a second print shop was established in Wittenberg.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1201" target="_blank">00:20:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He got one of the established Leipzig, one of the most experienced Leipzig printers, to send his son to start a branch office in Wittenberg.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1212" target="_blank">00:20:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, with this much better equipped shop, the press at Wittenberg improved enormously.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1224" target="_blank">00:20:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But perhaps the critical element of this was not the Leipzig shop itself moving to Wittenberg, it was the involvement of the painter Lukas Kranach.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1235" target="_blank">00:20:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Kranach was by this point one of the richest people in Wittenberg. He built a huge workshop factory where he turned out art for the print.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1246" target="_blank">00:20:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But he also was extremely shrewd financially, and he recognized in printing a big growth area to get into.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1254" target="_blank">00:20:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is what creates the brand, because Kranach creates for Wittenberg works beautiful title pages with exquisite Renaissance borders.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1266" target="_blank">00:21:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And into these woodcut frames can then be placed the title with Luther's name, Martin Luther, and below Wittenberg.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1276" target="_blank">00:21:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's this which I think brands Luther's works very effectively.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1281" target="_blank">00:21:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think I'm more sure of this actually than when I wrote the book, because one of my students has been working on this material here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1290" target="_blank">00:21:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And he's discovered not only the vast number of books which appeared in this uniform with these wonderful woodcuts,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1300" target="_blank">00:21:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but the number of times that these Wittenberg images were plagiarized by printers outside Wittenberg.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1308" target="_blank">00:21:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And not only did they recut the woodcuts to give them the appearance of Kranach's work, but they actually put Wittenberg on the title pages as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1319" target="_blank">00:21:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So they were appropriating the Wittenberg brand in order to sell books which weren't printed in Wittenberg.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1327" target="_blank">00:22:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that must have been very frustrating for Kranach, but it was a mark of just how successful this had been.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1334" target="_blank">00:22:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, that's very interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1338" target="_blank">00:22:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Designers have really been important in the history of the Reformation, book printing even from the beginning 500 years ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1345" target="_blank">00:22:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And of course, Kranach is most famous for Luther's portraits.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1350" target="_blank">00:22:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And Luther himself was very clearly a master of book aesthetics and design himself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1355" target="_blank">00:22:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">These are big deals for him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1357" target="_blank">00:22:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the popularity of Luther's works generate massive sales that benefit the press and push his further works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1365" target="_blank">00:22:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Give us a sense of the economics of Luther's publishing momentum.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1370" target="_blank">00:22:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, the economics, I think, are that there is some absolute growth in the market in the sense that people spent more to put disposable income on books.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1385" target="_blank">00:23:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's also an extent to which these sums were being redirected to the buying of Luther pamphlets from other purposes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1397" target="_blank">00:23:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">whether it was longer Latin books or indeed indulgence certificates.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1402" target="_blank">00:23:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because a single page, your certificate of indulgence might actually cost you a very considerable sum.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1408" target="_blank">00:23:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Just before 1517, the German church had introduced a sort of sliding scale, sort of income related tax which you had to pay for your indulgence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1422" target="_blank">00:23:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you decided that on theological grounds you would no longer supply yourself with indulgence,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1429" target="_blank">00:23:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that left quite a lot of disposable income which could then be redeployed into other sorts of books.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1435" target="_blank">00:23:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So in general terms, the market grows in absolute terms and also shifts from Latin to German.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1444" target="_blank">00:24:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's also the case that so many of Luther's texts are very short that you actually can buy quite a lot of texts for the same amount of money that you would want to spend on a single Latin text.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1456" target="_blank">00:24:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the economics are very much in favor of the Reformation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1462" target="_blank">00:24:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the good thing about these small books is the rate of return.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1467" target="_blank">00:24:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If you publish a 16-page quarto pamphlet, that needs only two pieces of paper printed front and back and then folded.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1477" target="_blank">00:24:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's basically two days' work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1480" target="_blank">00:24:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So within three or four days of getting the text into the shop and getting your compositor to make up the printed pages, you've got something to sell.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1489" target="_blank">00:24:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And Luther sold so well that you might sell out the whole edition without the need to send it anywhere but where your shop was, whether that was Wittenberg or Augsburg.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1500" target="_blank">00:25:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Compare that to a major Latin text which would have been required perhaps nine months to complete the printing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1510" target="_blank">00:25:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It would then have to be sent to other major towns in order to sell the entire edition, which means that in order to make back your costs might cost the best part of two years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1527" target="_blank">00:25:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And indeed, you might not make back the whole cost because by the time all these larger books have been sold, there were so many other people involved, the carters who carried them along,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1539" target="_blank">00:25:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the booksellers who sold them, the wholesalers who took stock off your hands, the money changers who brought the cash back to you in terms of bills of exchange.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1552" target="_blank">00:25:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All of this was eroding profit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1554" target="_blank">00:25:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">With Luther's books, because of their local sales and because it was so rapid, you got a very, very rapid rate of return.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1562" target="_blank">00:26:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that meant that these small print shops in places like Wittenberg were quickly building capital to take on the bigger projects like Luther's translation of the Bible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1574" target="_blank">00:26:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, really important projects to come.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1576" target="_blank">00:26:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the translation and printing of that Bible is no small footnote in Luther's legacy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1582" target="_blank">00:26:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But you actually use one of those key short works to date the real beginning of the Protestant Reformation to the spring of 1518 is when you would date it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1592" target="_blank">00:26:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm talking about Luther's short book titled The Sermon on Indulgences and Grace.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1597" target="_blank">00:26:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a very short book of just 1,500 words.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1600" target="_blank">00:26:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Writing theology for the masses through short form writings was a particular innovation of Luther's, as you say in your book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1608" target="_blank">00:26:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So for Luther, I mean, how fast could Luther turn out a new book like this one, this 1,500-word one, from writing to printing?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1617" target="_blank">00:26:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">How long did it take?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1618" target="_blank">00:26:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, that's a very interesting question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1621" target="_blank">00:27:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You have to think that he was writing extremely fast because he published, I think, something like 45 original writings in the first three years of the Reformation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1636" target="_blank">00:27:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Wow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1637" target="_blank">00:27:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Astonishing achievements.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1638" target="_blank">00:27:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And all of these were very reactive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1640" target="_blank">00:27:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They were responses to other people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1642" target="_blank">00:27:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's also the case that none of this work reduced his normal duties, his duties in the university, his preaching in town church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1654" target="_blank">00:27:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I read a letter recently where Luther's complaining about his work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1659" target="_blank">00:27:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He was overwhelmed by all this, not least his correspondence because, of course, responding to people personally, he wrote him to say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1668" target="_blank">00:27:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"I'm very troubled by what you've been saying," or "I'm very enthusiastic about what you've been saying."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1674" target="_blank">00:27:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All of these letters required an individual response.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1677" target="_blank">00:27:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then he tells us he's actually teaching the children of Wittenberg their catechisms on a daily basis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1685" target="_blank">00:28:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the sheer physical resilience of this man at a time of extreme stress must have been quite remarkable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1695" target="_blank">00:28:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">By about 1530, he was pretty sick.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1699" target="_blank">00:28:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And although he lived until 1546, he was really never in good health again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1707" target="_blank">00:28:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the first years was just a sort of wild, adrenalized ride, helped by the fact that he was fairly phlegmatic about the outcomes for himself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1720" target="_blank">00:28:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He didn't really expect to survive this confrontation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1725" target="_blank">00:28:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">No, he did not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1726" target="_blank">00:28:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's an important point in the story.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1729" target="_blank">00:28:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Marshall McLuhan, the late Roman Catholic media ecologist, is less impressed by this whole story.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1738" target="_blank">00:28:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He once said on the rise of the printing press by Luther, "The church was destroyed or dismembered in that era by a stupid historical blunder by a technology."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1750" target="_blank">00:29:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Luther, I presume, did not think of the printing press as a stupid historical blunder, but as a divine gift.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1756" target="_blank">00:29:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But from Rome's view, what do you think McLuhan means here?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1760" target="_blank">00:29:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I'm not sure what Marshall McLuhan means there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1763" target="_blank">00:29:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, if he means that the blunder from the point of view of the church was not to embrace the press themselves, then they may have something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1775" target="_blank">00:29:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because before the Reformation, the Roman Catholic Church, the Orthodox Church, was the major client of the press.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1785" target="_blank">00:29:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Forty percent of everything that was produced on the press was produced for the church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1790" target="_blank">00:29:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But the difficulty for opponents of Luther was that they really didn't think that this sort of popular theology was appropriate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1799" target="_blank">00:29:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They didn't think that theology should be discussed with lay people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1803" target="_blank">00:30:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They thought this should be kept in the clerical family.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1806" target="_blank">00:30:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was that which really hamstrung people who disapproved of Luther.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1812" target="_blank">00:30:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Luther's opponents were actually very capable, but they were by and large writing in Latin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1819" target="_blank">00:30:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the historical blunder of the church was the refusal to follow Luther into the vernacular.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1826" target="_blank">00:30:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And by the time they woke up to that fact and began producing vernacular works, Luther had so much of an advantage that by and large their works didn't sell.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1838" target="_blank">00:30:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you like, you know, the test is the marketplace here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1842" target="_blank">00:30:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And Luther and his supporters sold nine books for every one that their Catholic opponents sold.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1850" target="_blank">00:30:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was that imbalance that really made it very difficult to restrain the impact of the Reformation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1859" target="_blank">00:30:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, absolutely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1861" target="_blank">00:31:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Luther's vernacular works, even today, are just loaded with a profound amount of his personal verve, his unction, his magnetism, quite a bit of his profanity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1873" target="_blank">00:31:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I can only imagine what he was like in person.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1877" target="_blank">00:31:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, I mean, unlike other Reformation leaders, Luther's personality, for good or bad, really oozes from the printed page.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1885" target="_blank">00:31:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, where did Luther learn how to transfer his personality onto the page like this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1891" target="_blank">00:31:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, that's one of the miracles of the Reformation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1895" target="_blank">00:31:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, there's nothing in Luther's training to suggest this astonishing facility as a vernacular writer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1902" target="_blank">00:31:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He was in his 30s before he'd published anything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1906" target="_blank">00:31:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He'd had a perfectly conventional theological education, and he was known famously for having been assailed by prodigious doubts about his own salvation and about his relationship with God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1925" target="_blank">00:32:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that doesn't suggest someone who would bring to the written world tremendous clarity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1931" target="_blank">00:32:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is a gift, and it's an unpredictable gift, but the reward, as has always been the case for early adopters of technological innovation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1945" target="_blank">00:32:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">they get the feel to themselves, much in the sense that the first politicians to look good on television are still inscribed in our memory because they've sensed something which is not yet a completely formed being.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1961" target="_blank">00:32:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And somehow Luther did this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1963" target="_blank">00:32:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's quite right to say that until Luther, theological writing was never brief and never had this extraordinary directness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1974" target="_blank">00:32:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">How did Luther find this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1976" target="_blank">00:32:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think what's important, but doesn't explain it, what is important is his experience as a parish minister.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1984" target="_blank">00:33:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That he was not just a professor, but he was also the minister of the parish church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1990" target="_blank">00:33:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So he would have had the experience of standing in front of the congregation in the one and only parish church in Wittenberg,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=1998" target="_blank">00:33:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">seeing the congregation in front of him, seeing their reactions, and knowing when they were listening and when they were not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=2005" target="_blank">00:33:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I see something of this same sense of what the people could understand in his early work, even in the 95 Theses themselves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgupQyRkLE8&t=2015" target="_blank">00:33:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, 10 of the Theses towards the end basically are quotes of what people have said to them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
