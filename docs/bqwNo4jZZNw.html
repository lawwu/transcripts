Obviously, the biggest questions are, how long until</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqwNo4jZZNw&t=101" target="_blank">00:01:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">we bottom?

So, if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqwNo4jZZNw&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.400</a></span> | <span class="t">you're saving, that's a good thing. Your returns are going to be pretty good. Obviously, what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqwNo4jZZNw&t=117" target="_blank">00:01:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">they look like in terms of an annualized basis depends on how long it takes.

So, John, put up this first one. I said a very simple example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqwNo4jZZNw&t=922" target="_blank">00:15:22.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's say you save $10,000 a year at the beginning of the year. You earn 10% a year</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqwNo4jZZNw&t=926" target="_blank">00:15:26.620</a></span> | <span class="t">because you put your money in the stock market. This is what it looks like on a line going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqwNo4jZZNw&t=930" target="_blank">00:15:30.780</a></span> | <span class="t">up. And you can see the curve goes up. That's the exponential thing. But that's a really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqwNo4jZZNw&t=934" target="_blank">00:15:34.460</a></span> | <span class="t">nice smooth line where you're just earning 10% every year. There's never any highs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqwNo4jZZNw&t=938" target="_blank">00:15:38.380</a></span> | <span class="t">never any lows. It just goes up. That's your retirement calculator. That's like putting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqwNo4jZZNw&t=942" target="_blank">00:15:42.220</a></span> | <span class="t">it on a spreadsheet and life is easy, right? Unfortunately, life doesn't work like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqwNo4jZZNw&t=946" target="_blank">00:15:46.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So, interestingly enough, if we look at the last 30 years, from 1992 to 2021, to the end</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqwNo4jZZNw&t=952" target="_blank">00:15:52.180</a></span> | <span class="t">of 2021, the average return in the stock market on the S&P 500 was roughly 10%. It was a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqwNo4jZZNw&t=957" target="_blank">00:15:57.060</a></span> | <span class="t">little more, but pretty darn close to 10%. So, let's do the next chart, John. And this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqwNo4jZZNw&t=961" target="_blank">00:16:01.260</a></span> | <span class="t">one shows the actual experience of someone putting $10,000 into the stock market every</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqwNo4jZZNw&t=966" target="_blank">00:16:06.420</a></span> | <span class="t">year and seeing what happens. And you can see it's all over the place. In the early</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqwNo4jZZNw&t=969" target="_blank">00:16:09.780</a></span> | <span class="t">part of the decade, it jumped. That was the late '90s. Then you go to 2008 and it falls,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqwNo4jZZNw&t=975" target="_blank">00:16:15.460</a></span> | <span class="t">right? And it's way below. And you can see that it's off of trend. We're talking like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqwNo4jZZNw&t=980" target="_blank">00:16:20.020</a></span> | <span class="t">$200,000 below trend. Then we get to even the later years. It's like $400,000, $300,000</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqwNo4jZZNw&t=986" target="_blank">00:16:26.620</a></span> | <span class="t">before trend. And then at the end, you have this 10-year period where stocks go bonkers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqwNo4jZZNw&t=991" target="_blank">00:16:31.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And finally, in the stock market, that 10% is high. So, why does it work like that? Because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqwNo4jZZNw&t=995" target="_blank">00:16:35.460</a></span> | <span class="t">you got pretty much the same 10% per year, right? That's the average return. But the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqwNo4jZZNw&t=999" target="_blank">00:16:39.860</a></span> | <span class="t">stock market actually gave you higher returns. Well, a lot of it had to do with the timing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqwNo4jZZNw&t=1002" target="_blank">00:16:42.440</a></span> | <span class="t">of it. So, like, when did you save? The returns were bad at the beginning, but really great</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqwNo4jZZNw&t=1006" target="_blank">00:16:46.260</a></span> | <span class="t">at the end. And the reason for this is that the stock market is lumpy, right? So, it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqwNo4jZZNw&t=1010" target="_blank">00:16:50.980</a></span> | <span class="t">all over the place. That compounding, it happens in bursts. It doesn't happen all at once,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqwNo4jZZNw&t=1015" target="_blank">00:16:55.980</a></span> | <span class="t">or it's not consistent. So, these results could have been different where the stock</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqwNo4jZZNw&t=1021" target="_blank">00:17:01.020</a></span> | <span class="t">market could have been below trend. Because if you had bad returns at the very end, it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqwNo4jZZNw&t=1025" target="_blank">00:17:05.260</a></span> | <span class="t">could have been even worse. So, a lot of it is due to timing and luck and how much you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqwNo4jZZNw&t=1028" target="_blank">00:17:08.580</a></span> | <span class="t">saving and when you're saving. This is a very simple example. But let's look at the drawdown</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqwNo4jZZNw&t=1032" target="_blank">00:17:12.580</a></span> | <span class="t">chart. This is since 1992 again. So, the last 30 years, if you look at the S&P 500 drawdown,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqwNo4jZZNw&t=1037" target="_blank">00:17:17.860</a></span> | <span class="t">we're talking return, I got separate losses of 11%, 19%, 12%, 12%, 50%, 15%, 57%, 16%,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqwNo4jZZNw&t=1045" target="_blank">00:17:25.980</a></span> | <span class="t">19%, 13%, 10%, 20%, 34%, and then the current one, which at the worst point was like 19%</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqwNo4jZZNw&t=1051" target="_blank">00:17:31.700</a></span> | <span class="t">down. So, you have all these drawdowns, double digits. And yet, the stock market is still</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqwNo4jZZNw&t=1057" target="_blank">00:17:37.820</a></span> | <span class="t">up over 10% per year.

Compounding the real</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqwNo4jZZNw&t=1066" target="_blank">00:17:46.380</a></span> | <span class="t">world is very messy and lumpy. And unfortunately, it has to be this way because if there was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqwNo4jZZNw&t=1069" target="_blank">00:17:49.740</a></span> | <span class="t">no risk, there would be no returns.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqwNo4jZZNw&t=1071" target="_blank">00:17:51.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.
