target="_blank">00:01:33.660</a></span> | <span class="t">relates to solving connections and other games but and that's an inspiration here for this project but the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.940</a></span> | <span class="t">processes and everything that I'm describing here I did on my own with my own research so for those of you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">who are not familiar with the game connections was launched by the New York Times in June of 2023 into beta and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=111" target="_blank">00:01:51.820</a></span> | <span class="t">officially released in August of 2023 to the greater world the game is edited by Winna Lu who's a awesome editor at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.500</a></span> | <span class="t">times that I work with on games and she creates the puzzles for connections it quickly became one of the New York Times most played game second only to wordle with hundreds of millions of plays within its first year and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=123" target="_blank">00:02:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">just to mention all the connections puzzles and game itself game the game mechanics and the programming etc are human made now and forever so all of our properties that fall into that category so the game is on the right in case you have your mobile apps want to download it so how connections works each so you have a daily puzzle and the game is on the right in case you have your mobile apps want to download it so how connections works each so you have a daily puzzle and the game is on the right in case you have your mobile apps want to download it so how connections works</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.120</a></span> | <span class="t">you have your mobile apps want to download it so you have your mobile apps want to download it so you have a daily puzzle and each puzzle provides 16 words to be grouped the visualization on the right is kind of demonstrating play the goal is to form four groups of words of four groups of four related words</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.120</a></span> | <span class="t">each word belongs only to one group and each word belongs only to one group no overlaps and players can make up to four incorrect guesses before losing so you can see that as the game finishes this particular situation the person has won the game</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.120</a></span> | <span class="t">so this is where the AI and data science and etc start to come into play there's a difficulty structure to connections so people who play the game probably know that the easiest category is yellow where yellow is like the most obvious when you actually solve the game the most obvious connections are within the yellow category</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">green is the slightly less obvious connections where you have to kind of stretch a little to think but once you get those it's kind of like okay this is kind of obvious</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">why how these things are related the blue category is trickier themes where you have things like sayings idiomatic lexical or trivia based themes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and then purple is the infamous purple for those of who you think of the game is a difficult game is the category that usually trips up most people from a perfect win and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.120</a></span> | <span class="t">that's because there's a concept of decoy slash overlap slash misleads that are associated with the purple category</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">so why is it an interesting game via AI analysis and standards so it can actually challenge AI's ability to abstractly reason</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and now at some point in time we all believe that LLMs can do absolutely everything and some people think that's true</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.120</a></span> | <span class="t">but one thing that connections has done throughout the course of its time period is actually challenged LLMs to actually have a hundred percent solve rate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the game's intentional decoys tests whether AI can over avoid overfitting or superficial similarities</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">each solution requires clean and explainable well aligned in with AI transparency so like for example if you want to figure out how AI reasoned it is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">how AI reasoned through a game this is an actual good like process because you do need some sort of reasoning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and perhaps abstract reasoning to solves like the difficult or purple category and you get to see how AI thinks about that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.120</a></span> | <span class="t">there's fixed input solutions make it a reproducible and scalable testbed so one of the interesting things that I like about this game particularly is because it is a could be a potential benchmarking tool and people have uses as such to test the capabilities of AI and since the puzzles are the same and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.120</a></span> | <span class="t">playable you can repeat this process and this is just me entering the puzzle in ChatGPT and ChatGPT giving the wrong solution</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.120</a></span> | <span class="t">this is sort of like unfair comparison because this is the 4.0 model the higher models do give better reasoning but that's not exactly I'll go into that a little later if I get to time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and so how do humans solve connections there's the concept of system one versus system two thinking I'm guessing many people might be familiar with this concept it came out in the 90s and it's so system one thinking is when you're trying to intuit relationships very fast when you see two things that are obviously part of the same category you don't have to think so much your brain sort of makes that automatic judgment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">system two which is slow and deliberate thinking is where you have like the sort of deep kind of reasoning which you need to perform and that's where you're like oh I'm struggling I don't know if this belongs to one or two let me use my knowledge base and then in order to solve the games most effectively most people use a high</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=361" target="_blank">00:06:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">where they use both their fast intuitive thinking and then the slow deep thinking and that's what takes a lot of time in the actual playing of the game and then you can suffer from canonical failures like system one failures you thought it looked obvious but you messed up because it wasn't actually obvious stuff belong to a different category or system two thinking where you're like oh I thought too deeply about this but it was actually the obvious one and so you know you over thought that one so that's one of the fun parts of the game if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=389" target="_blank">00:06:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">that's one of the fun parts of the game if you think that's fun so connection studies and benchmarks do exist there's several benchmarks for solving connections with the later models that are come out that have come out they're not by us they're third party benchmarks but they do demonstrate progressive capability of LLMs to solve the game but it's still not perfect and as I mentioned before there are caveats that solvability</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=396" target="_blank">00:06:36.120</a></span> | <span class="t">so there's now I'm going into the like deeper part and I'm going into the like deeper part and I'm going to see how far I get through the rest of this because this is where my AI analysis goes into play</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">so if this is mathematics this is your chances of winning the game if you're winning the game and you're going to see how far I get through the rest of this because this is where my AI analysis goes into play</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=408" target="_blank">00:06:48.120</a></span> | <span class="t">so if this is mathematics this is your chances of winning the game if you're guessing randomly right if you use no intuition whatsoever so if you're totally randomly guessing you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=415" target="_blank">00:06:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">if you have the complete initial board you have the complete initial board you have about a zero percent chance of winning then the mathematics or combinatorics of the connections board indicate that after maybe if you get one category right and you get one category right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=430" target="_blank">00:07:10.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're totally randomly guessing, you have, if you have the complete initial board,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

you still need to randomly guess through the next three,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=447" target="_blank">00:07:27.480</a></span> | <span class="t">you have about a 1 in 5,000, 1 in 6,000 chance of winning, which is tiny, but it's, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=452" target="_blank">00:07:32.900</a></span> | <span class="t">you could maybe do it, I don't know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=454" target="_blank">00:07:34.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And then most people get stuck on the third and fourth category where it's like, oh, I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=458" target="_blank">00:07:38.360</a></span> | <span class="t">don't know, like I got two, and now all these words, how do they relate to each other?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=462" target="_blank">00:07:42.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're like, screw it, I'm going to guess randomly, then you have a 1 in 35% chance,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=467" target="_blank">00:07:47.120</a></span> | <span class="t">1 in 35% chance of winning or about 10% chance.</span></div><div class="c"><span

target="_blank">00:08:11.220</a></span> | <span class="t">There's some numbers associated with the graph, not going to get too deep into that, but I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=495" target="_blank">00:08:15.100</a></span> | <span class="t">doing that chromatic number is important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=498" target="_blank">00:08:18.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And when you want to solve a graph coloring problem, you use algorithms that are popularly known,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=503" target="_blank">00:08:23.220</a></span> | <span class="t">backtracking, greedy coloring.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=505" target="_blank">00:08:25.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And the graph coloring problem, just for interest, has applications in all kinds of areas outside</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=511" target="_blank">00:08:31.400</a></span> | <span class="t">of, you know, just science, scheduling, frequency assignment, wireless networks, and in connections.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=517" target="_blank">00:08:37.900</a></span> | <span class="t">But you can model connections as a graph coloring, an augmented graph coloring problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=522" target="_blank">00:08:42.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is a connection solver that I built on the right, that's a bunch of puzzles and attempts</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=526" target="_blank">00:08:46.280</a></span> | <span class="t">to organize them into graph coloring groups.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=529" target="_blank">00:08:49.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So each of the words, 16 words and connections can be a vertex in this graph.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=534" target="_blank">00:08:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">The hidden categories that we already went over, they're color coded.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=539" target="_blank">00:08:59.380</a></span> | <span class="t">The goal is to color each word node with one of the four categories, such that all four words</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=543" target="_blank">00:09:03.740</a></span> | <span class="t">belong to a specific category, receive the same color.</span></div><div

it's thought of to exist between words.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=550" target="_blank">00:09:10.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So that is basically how related they are, is the edge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=554" target="_blank">00:09:14.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So the reason why that's important is because that creates the search space for an algorithm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=559" target="_blank">00:09:19.180</a></span> | <span class="t">or an AI to actually, you know, play the game effectively, or solve the game effectively.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=564" target="_blank">00:09:24.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Without that, it's falling into the random range of sorting words and it becomes much more difficult.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=570" target="_blank">00:09:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have this idea of semantic similarity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=573" target="_blank">00:09:33.500</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not enough.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=574" target="_blank">00:09:34.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I've renamed it semantic similarity is not all you need if you get the transformer

here, but there's a tree of word relationships between</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=585" target="_blank">00:09:45.180</a></span> | <span class="t">different words.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=586" target="_blank">00:09:46.180</a></span> | <span class="t">For example, anagrams are related, could be a type of category called orthography of words.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=591" target="_blank">00:09:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So you know, that could be an entire category.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=594" target="_blank">00:09:54.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Morphology, meaning things like that have the same suffix, like something like kingdom, fiefdom,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=601" target="_blank">00:10:01.420</a></span> | <span class="t">or connectedness, things like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=604" target="_blank">00:10:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Then you have other semantic relationships that are not so obvious, which could be things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=607" target="_blank">00:10:07.940</a></span> | <span class="t">like encyclopedic relationships.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=610" target="_blank">00:10:10.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Like for example, globe, mirror, post, and sun are all part of the newspaper category.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=614" target="_blank">00:10:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you have things like associative relationships, things that are red or things that are green,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=618" target="_blank">00:10:18.980</a></span> | <span

I just going back to this polysemy, things that can like, for example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=626" target="_blank">00:10:26.260</a></span> | <span class="t">what a mole can be, an animal, birthmark, spy, or unit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=630" target="_blank">00:10:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">That is where the connections actually, just for interest's sake, is the most complicated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=635" target="_blank">00:10:35.720</a></span> | <span class="t">for most AIs and people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=637" target="_blank">00:10:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Because that's the polysemy, multiple meaning section is where on a base level, people get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=642" target="_blank">00:10:42.540</a></span> | <span class="t">tripped up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=643" target="_blank">00:10:43.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Any intelligence can get tripped up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=645" target="_blank">00:10:45.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So you have this concept of relational alignment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=648" target="_blank">00:10:48.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So relational alignment is if you can create a metric that associates two words together,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=653" target="_blank">00:10:53.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you can have a relational alignment score.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=655" target="_blank">00:10:55.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's different metrics that are associated with relational alignment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=659" target="_blank">00:10:59.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I created this heat map simulation on the right, which can pick different metrics</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=663" target="_blank">00:11:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and show how based on the metric calculations, which I'm not showing here, that these two things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=667" target="_blank">00:11:07.480</a></span> | <span class="t">words from a large category are related.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=672" target="_blank">00:11:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Now the story I'm building up is that relational alignment between puzzles can help you determine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=679" target="_blank">00:11:19.940</a></span> | <span class="t">on a computational way whether a puzzle is easy or whether it's hard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=683" target="_blank">00:11:23.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is an example from an easy puzzle years ago that was done versus a hard puzzle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=690" target="_blank">00:11:30.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is like people have described this as the solve rate is 19% for the hard puzzle,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=694" target="_blank">00:11:34.940</a></span> | <span class="t">but like 70 something for the easier puzzle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=697" target="_blank">00:11:37.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can see that there's a rough overarching coherence or relational alignment score differential</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=702" target="_blank">00:11:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">between easy and hard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=704" target="_blank">00:11:44.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So that differential lets you understand there's a computational process which you can apply.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=709" target="_blank">00:11:49.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can see that time variant relational alignment scores can go across categories and time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=715" target="_blank">00:11:55.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So puzzles are easy, puzzles are hard, and you see some sort of time variant metric, which,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=719" target="_blank">00:11:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, you can compute this and you can draw a graph over time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=723" target="_blank">00:12:03.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not sure what happened here on 12-12, I think, oh we had a broken puzzle that day,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=727" target="_blank">00:12:07.480</a></span> | <span class="t">so it was zero.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=729" target="_blank">00:12:09.340</a></span> | <span class="t">But the idea is that you can see that there could be patterns established from this alignment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=734" target="_blank">00:12:14.120</a></span> | <span class="t">score that you compute.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=735" target="_blank">00:12:15.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Now if it was that easy, that would be great, but it's not actually that easy because as we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=739" target="_blank">00:12:19.300</a></span> | <span class="t">have multiple different semantic relationships, we have multiple relational alignment scores.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=744" target="_blank">00:12:24.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So basically two words can be related in multiple ways and they can have different scores</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=749" target="_blank">00:12:29.400</a></span> | <span class="t">across different categories.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=751" target="_blank">00:12:31.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So some can be semantically or morphologically more strongly related than they are, for example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=757" target="_blank">00:12:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">categorically or encyclopedically related.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=759" target="_blank">00:12:39.580</a></span> | <span class="t">But the idea is that you can create sort of this radar chart, which lets you kind of map</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=764" target="_blank">00:12:44.040</a></span> | <span class="t">out some sort of diagram or surface which you can analyze to see how the semantic space of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=770" target="_blank">00:12:50.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the word across different categories looks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=772" target="_blank">00:12:52.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So that means you have yet another dimension to analyze how your AI can analyze how to solve</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=778" target="_blank">00:12:58.540</a></span> | <span class="t">a puzzle or your AI or solver or you yourself if you want to think about this stuff more deeply</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=784" target="_blank">00:13:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">using your reasoning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=786" target="_blank">00:13:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So multi-dimensional relational alignment distribution was part of the things that I was kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=791" target="_blank">00:13:11.180</a></span> | <span class="t">looking at.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=792" target="_blank">00:13:12.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So I basically, another component of the system I built was the semantic distribution evaluation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=797" target="_blank">00:13:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">framework where I'm taking a bunch of our puzzles and then I'm building this categorical distribution</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=803" target="_blank">00:13:23.060</a></span> | <span class="t">over time where you can see on the lower right, it's hard maybe to see a little bit, but there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=806" target="_blank">00:13:26.900</a></span> | <span class="t">the different categories like hypernomy, morphology, orthography, things I talked about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=811" target="_blank">00:13:31.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And the distribution of categories for the connections puzzles over time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=817" target="_blank">00:13:37.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you can see I'm counting like which categories over the days fall into which of these buckets</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=821" target="_blank">00:13:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">with these dots on this right and I can build a sort of like histogram or count of this association.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=827" target="_blank">00:13:47.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you can look at trends and then you can use that data, that trend data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=831" target="_blank">00:13:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So now here it gets a little bit more involved.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=834" target="_blank">00:13:54.820</a></span> | <span class="t">The graph coloring approximation is a search space reduction process, but then you get to a more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=840" target="_blank">00:14:00.520</a></span> | <span class="t">complicated idea of graph

relationships into the actual formulation, you actually start to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=847" target="_blank">00:14:07.800</a></span> | <span class="t">build multi-dimensional or hypergraphs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=850" target="_blank">00:14:10.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is just a three-dimensional hypergraph, but if you have multiple semantic relationships,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=854" target="_blank">00:14:14.520</a></span> | <span class="t">you actually have multi-dimensional hypergraphs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=856" target="_blank">00:14:16.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is kind of just a demonstration of how the hypergraph converges in three dimensions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=861" target="_blank">00:14:21.140</a></span> | <span class="t">meaning that if you have all these semantic relationships, you're going to have these inter-cluster</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=866" target="_blank">00:14:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">strengths between different nodes and different categories, but you also have the intra-cluster</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=871" target="_blank">00:14:31.900</a></span> | <span class="t">strength, which shows you how strong the relationships are within the clusters that form due to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=876" target="_blank">00:14:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">algorithm you're using.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=877" target="_blank">00:14:37.560</a></span> | <span class="t">That's important because this graph gives you more dimensionality and, again, is a more computational</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=883" target="_blank">00:14:43.620</a></span> | <span class="t">way of using AI to solve this problem or any, again, solver to solve the problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=890" target="_blank">00:14:50.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So how do you build these semantic graphs?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=892" target="_blank">00:14:52.120</a></span> | <span class="t">You can use different types of lexical databases or lexical constructors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=896" target="_blank">00:14:56.900</a></span> | <span class="t">For example, WordNet, ConceptNet, and other word embeddings can be used to construct these relationships.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=901" target="_blank">00:15:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this is a flat example of a 2D graph of one puzzle where you see relationships between, like, different words.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=908" target="_blank">00:15:08.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, for example, two words co-occur together, a mouse hunts a cat, a dog is related to a cat, a cat is capable of play, a cat is used for pet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=917" target="_blank">00:15:17.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can see the complex dimensionality of these conceptual semantic graphs is derived from WordNet, ConceptNet, and word embeddings allows you even more space.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=926" target="_blank">00:15:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're increasing the intelligence here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=927" target="_blank">00:15:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">You see, I'm not just doing a reasoning model or dumbly put it into an LLM.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=931" target="_blank">00:15:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm actually trying to increase the intelligence space, like, procedurally so that you can have a trackable and explainable way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=939" target="_blank">00:15:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, explainable AI, that's what I'm all about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=941" target="_blank">00:15:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">This is part of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=943" target="_blank">00:15:43.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So to get to the actual model which does that, anyone familiar with graph neural networks?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=949" target="_blank">00:15:49.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so if you've used GNNs before, that's the primary, since it's a geometric problem in multi-space, you--</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=955" target="_blank">00:15:55.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, the primary solver that I'm using is a graph convolutional neural network, which allows you to kind of take in the graph as an input and then put, like, candidate subgraphs that could be solutions as outputs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=970" target="_blank">00:16:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">This is one part of the problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=972" target="_blank">00:16:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It's part of a two-part problem where I'm using the graph--</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=975" target="_blank">00:16:15.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the reinforcement learning system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=977" target="_blank">00:16:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So once we have the graph neural network that's actually outputting candidate graphs, you have edge weights and node weights that are being optimized, and then you find out which graph, like, fits into the candidate solutions, then you can track the actual structure of the graph, which is cluster morphology, or, like, how the graph looks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=994" target="_blank">00:16:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">The next visualization-- this is the system diagram, I'm not going to go into it, it's a lot, but I'll just say it's the combination of a reinforcement learning agent with a graph-based system for actually--</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=1007" target="_blank">00:16:47.720</a></span> | <span class="t">with the graph neural network for kind of isolating how-- what candidate graphs you have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=1012" target="_blank">00:16:52.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this is-- I'm almost out of time, but I'll just say that this is kind of, like, how the visualization looks in 3Space.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=1018" target="_blank">00:16:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Once your semantic graphs are-- once your semantic graphs are constructed, your graph candidates and the reinforcement learning system is kind of the appropriate way to kind of navigate these subclusters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=1031" target="_blank">00:17:11.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can't actually see the cluster points here because the visualization wasn't super great, but the actual output is kind of like, OK, now this-- this traversal is allowed to exist.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=1040" target="_blank">00:17:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So, again, after all this stuff, the solvability rate from before to after for a short-- a small subset of hard puzzles increases somewhat reasonably.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=1050" target="_blank">00:17:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But now, again, this is a work in progress, and I tried this against a few puzzles before and after, and now the idea is to extend this and, like, make it more involved for even more puzzles and then get to game development.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=1061" target="_blank">00:17:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So why do all this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=1062" target="_blank">00:17:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Or-- well, our LLMs are great at a bunch of stuff, but, you know, they can often make, you know, their own mistakes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=1068" target="_blank">00:17:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">LLMs often are trained on internet data and the puzzle solutions are available on the internet, so who knows if they're just pulling the solutions from the internet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=1075" target="_blank">00:17:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">That's one thing that bothered me about LLMs solving these problems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=1079" target="_blank">00:17:59.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so-- and that's-- LLM solutions are still a black box.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=1083" target="_blank">00:18:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the idea is to connect this to the ArcGi benchmark and that kind of thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=1089" target="_blank">00:18:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, that benchmark has a partition-- like a-- yeah, a solvability association.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=1097" target="_blank">00:18:17.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we have some next steps, and this is pretty much the end of my presentation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=1100" target="_blank">00:18:20.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I ran a few seconds over, but, yeah, if you're interested, talk to me later.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=1104" target="_blank">00:18:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">LLMs. All right, thanks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uhFGH4J9Y&t=1104" target="_blank">00:18:24.960</a></span> | <span
