We've got a lot to get to today, so let's do the first one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=45" target="_blank">00:00:45.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So, first up, we have a question from Tony, who writes, "Will demographics lead</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=51" target="_blank">00:00:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to reduced asset buying as boomers spend down their retirement and transfer wealth to kids</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=55" target="_blank">00:00:55.640</a></span> | <span class="t">upon death?" So, starting off with an upbeat one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=58" target="_blank">00:00:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. This is a common one, and I think we answered something similar a couple months</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=62" target="_blank">00:01:02.360</a></span> | <span class="t">ago, but that was dealing more with the stock market. So, the idea there was, wealth is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=67" target="_blank">00:01:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">concentrated in the hands of the few. The top 10% own something like 89% of the stocks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=70" target="_blank">00:01:10.840</a></span> | <span class="t">in the U.S. So, my take there is, like, there's not going to be many forced sellers. A lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=74" target="_blank">00:01:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">of it will just end up getting transferred because it's all rich people who won't need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=77" target="_blank">00:01:17.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to sell.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=78" target="_blank">00:01:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And even as the boomers do begin selling their assets, the millennials are going to come</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=81" target="_blank">00:01:21.560</a></span> | <span class="t">into their prime earnings years. So, John, let's do the chart out of this most common</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.440</a></span> | <span class="t">ages in the United States. So, the Census Bureau publishes this, the most common ages,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=87" target="_blank">00:01:27.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and they rank them. And you can see it starts in 2010, and in 2020, then they predict out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.600</a></span> | <span class="t">to 2025, 2030, 2035. You can see in 2010, the young people are just starting to come</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=97" target="_blank">00:01:37.560</a></span> | <span class="t">up. Now, almost all of the most common ages are 20s, 30s, 40s. It's going up to that because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=102" target="_blank">00:01:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the millennials are getting older, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I actually think that, and the millennials are now the biggest demographic in the country.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=109" target="_blank">00:01:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that the millennials actually are going to have a bigger impact going forward</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=111" target="_blank">00:01:51.880</a></span> | <span class="t">than the boomers. And I want to look at this beyond the stock market. So, let's show this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">ownership of financial assets. This is kind of what I was getting into. And this just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.400</a></span> | <span class="t">shows stocks versus housing. You can see that the top 1%, the majority of their assets are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=123" target="_blank">00:02:03.560</a></span> | <span class="t">in financial assets, stocks and bonds and real estate and that sort of stuff. But their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.400</a></span> | <span class="t">primary residence isn't that big of a deal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">But for the bottom 50%, especially, and even the 50 to 90%, primary residence is a huge</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.160</a></span> | <span class="t">driver of their financial net worth. So, I want to talk about how this demographic stuff</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.860</a></span> | <span class="t">is going to impact the real estate market. So, I never really bought into this idea following</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.800</a></span> | <span class="t">2008 after the housing crisis that millennials were never going to buy homes and they were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">never going to drive cars and they were never going to move to the suburbs because that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">what people do when they get older.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I think millennials just kind of pushed it out a little bit because they went to school</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.200</a></span> | <span class="t">a little longer in a lot of cases.

And so, as people get older, they take on more responsibilities and they damn</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">sure are going to buy a house in most cases, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And millennials are buying houses in force right now.

Millennials are buying, this is home purchase applications from the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Wall Street Journal.

Now it's well over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.900</a></span> | <span class="t">50%.

So, we purchased</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.500</a></span> | <span class="t">our first home, I think I was 25, 26, had been married for maybe a year at that point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And we kind of said, "Oh, this is going to be our forever home." Then our family got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.780</a></span> | <span class="t">bigger and so we moved on.

It's not going to work. We had to move. And I think so many people in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.700</a></span> | <span class="t">finance look at this stuff from an investing perspective instead of life events, especially</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.500</a></span> | <span class="t">when it comes to housing, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So people, like life events don't care about investments and mortgage rates and prices</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.580</a></span> | <span class="t">and ROI and all these things.

So, you know, I used to use the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=1153" target="_blank">00:19:13.860</a></span> | <span class="t">blog because I kinda did a deep dive about 20 years ago into jazz. I was always a classic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=1161" target="_blank">00:19:21.160</a></span> | <span class="t">rock sort of guy. But I found about 30 years ago the American Songbook and toured singers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=1167" target="_blank">00:19:27.660</a></span> | <span class="t">like Sinatra and Fitzgerald and Julie London and working with Sarah Vaughan, et cetera,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=1171" target="_blank">00:19:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">et cetera, et cetera. So I started doing these Friday posts, Friday night posts, weekend</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=1176" target="_blank">00:19:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">jazz or Friday night jazz. And it's, you learn so much when you have the ability to briefly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=1183" target="_blank">00:19:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">explain it to someone and just say, "Hey, if you're interested in X, look at this and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=1187" target="_blank">00:19:47.800</a></span> | <span class="t">here's why this is important." Now, lately, I've been doing that with cars. I've been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=1191" target="_blank">00:19:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">trying to learn more about the classic car market. So every Friday, I throw up, "Here's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=1196" target="_blank">00:19:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">an interesting car. Here's what makes it unique. Here's what's crazy about the pricing. This</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=1200" target="_blank">00:20:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">is either really cheap or this is really expensive." And it's revealing about a niche little market</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=1206" target="_blank">00:20:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that you can leap off from. But it could be anything. You know, JC was doing this with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=1211" target="_blank">00:20:11.720</a></span> | <span class="t">wines for a while, talking about rinds. Ed Giardini writes about movies and has been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=1217" target="_blank">00:20:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">doing a movie review in his weekly market update for like 30 years. It's incredible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=1224" target="_blank">00:20:24.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So you really develop an expertise by being able to explain it to third parties.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=1229" target="_blank">00:20:29.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And other people will give you feedback if you're wrong. Like the internet is full of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=1233" target="_blank">00:20:33.640</a></span> | <span class="t">people who are more knowledgeable than you in a lot of areas and they give you feedback.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=1237" target="_blank">00:20:37.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I think your other point that was really good is about, I was sick of answering questions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=1240" target="_blank">00:20:40.980</a></span> | <span class="t">for people. So this very last question where the guy says, "What do I write about if I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=1244" target="_blank">00:20:44.280</a></span> | <span class="t">feel like I'm not connecting to my audience?"

So build a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=1257" target="_blank">00:20:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">library of questions that they're going to ask in the future about rising interest rates</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=1261" target="_blank">00:21:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">or higher inflation or lower inflation or bear markets or whatever. And then when they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=1265" target="_blank">00:21:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">ask it in the future, inevitably you go, "Oh, I wrote about that two years ago. Here's this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=1269" target="_blank">00:21:09.080</a></span> | <span class="t">piece."

That's the whole thing. Build a library and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=1276" target="_blank">00:21:16.360</a></span> | <span class="t">just go straight to your clients and the stuff that they're going to ask you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=1279" target="_blank">00:21:19.560</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, writing, especially publicly, teaches you to develop better listening skills.

Even if you're not custom writing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=1338" target="_blank">00:22:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to that audience, at least they need to know you understand who they are, you respect them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9nC-PnjSWA&t=1343" target="_blank">00:22:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and you're aware of their circumstances.
