Transgression declares to the ungodly within his heart. There is no dread of God before his eyes, for it flatters him in his eyes for one to discover his iniquity and hate it.</p><p>The words of his mouth are wickedness and deceit. He has ceased to consider to do good. He devises wickedness upon his bed. He sets himself on a path that is not good. He does not despise evil. Your love and kindness, O Yahweh, is in the heavens. Your faithfulness reaches to the skies.</p><p>Your righteousness is like the mountains of God. Your judgments are like a great deep. O Yahweh, you save man and beast. How precious is your love and kindness, O God. And the sons of men take refuge in the shadow of your wings. They're satisfied from the richness of your house, and you give them to drink of the river of your delight, for with you is the fountain of life.</p><p>In your light we see light. Continue your loving kindness to those who know you, and your righteousness to the upright in heart. Let not the foot of pride come upon me, and let not the hand of the ungodly drive me away. There the workers of wickedness have fallen. They have been thrust down and cannot rise.</p><p>Amen. Amen. Amen. you</p></div></div></body></html>
