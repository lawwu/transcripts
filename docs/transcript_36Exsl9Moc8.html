That quote always gives people like this. I always get this queasy look at the face of people I'm talking to, and I roll that quote out.</p><p>But it really is, it's really intense. And so I always tell people, whenever anybody asks me if they should start a company, the answer is always no, because it's just, it's such a, just like gigantic, like emotional, irrational kind of thing to do. The implications of that decision is so profound in terms of how you live your life that I, yeah, look, there, there are plenty of great ideas, plenty of interesting things to do, but the actual process is so difficult.</p><p>It, it gets romanticized a lot and it's not romantic. It's a very difficult thing to do. And I did it, I did it multiple times before. So at least for now I don't, I don't revisit that.</p></div></div></body></html>
