"Rejoice in the wife of your youth, a lovely dear, a graceful doe. Let her breasts fill you at all times with delight. Be intoxicated always in her love."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bHViccwTNM&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Why would you be intoxicated, my son, with a forbidden woman and embrace the bosom of an adulteress?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bHViccwTNM&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's Proverbs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bHViccwTNM&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's not as though this book, Song of Solomon, is in some world of its own in dealing with explicit sexual enjoyments between a husband and wife.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bHViccwTNM&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The rest of the Bible can point in that direction as well, sometimes with remarkable explicitness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bHViccwTNM&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's another issue. Even if the Song of Solomon is treated as allegorical, Solomon would not use sin to signify the relationship between God and his bride.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bHViccwTNM&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In a sense, it's even more striking, if it is allegorical, that we should use such graphic, that Solomon would use such graphic sexual language to think of our relationship with God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bHViccwTNM&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think that blunts or lessens the remarkable sexual implications for husband and wife because it's used in reference to God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bHViccwTNM&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So even if you do take it as an allegory, you have a remarkable explicitness about what is in the bedroom of a godly man and wife.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bHViccwTNM&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's the main thing I think I'd want to say.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bHViccwTNM&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The Song of Solomon confronts us with the challenge not just of literary allegory, but life allegory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bHViccwTNM&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is the main thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bHViccwTNM&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's what I mean.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bHViccwTNM&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It calls us to look into and through the physical pleasures of sex, both in Solomon's song and in our bedroom.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bHViccwTNM&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In other words, it's not just that this song is really physical and also points to something spiritual in relationship to God and the church, but that life is physical and points to something spiritual.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bHViccwTNM&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In other words, the literary sex and the real sex are both allegorical.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bHViccwTNM&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">God didn't just give us the Song of Solomon to show us something of his love.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bHViccwTNM&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He gave us sex to show us something of his love.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bHViccwTNM&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So what I want to stress is that the person who is fit to interpret the Song of Solomon is the person who in real life has the spiritual depth and sensitivities and wisdom to see in real sex the realities of joy in relation to Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bHViccwTNM&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If you come to the Song of Solomon without having read life as allegorical, that is, life as pointing to the glories of union with Christ, you're probably going to stomp all over this beautiful poem like you've got spikes on instead of slippers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bHViccwTNM&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not going to be very fruitful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bHViccwTNM&t=347" target="_blank">00:05:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In other words, this is not for children.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bHViccwTNM&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">To get this right, this is not for men and women for whom sexual intercourse is merely a one-dimensional flight of passion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bHViccwTNM&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If that's all you have in your bedroom is a one-dimensional flight of physical passion, you're not fit to read the Song of Solomon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bHViccwTNM&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because it is that, but way more than that, because life is way more than that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bHViccwTNM&t=374" target="_blank">00:06:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The Song of Solomon will be handled well by those who know that sexual relations really, not just in literature, sexual relations is a picture of something glorious.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bHViccwTNM&t=387" target="_blank">00:06:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's no less physical for that any more than the heavens that proclaim the glory of God are less physical when they do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bHViccwTNM&t=398" target="_blank">00:06:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I just want to plead for people to go deep into all of life as a parable of Christ and his church, and then they might be fit to handle a literary description of sexuality the way they should.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bHViccwTNM&t=418" target="_blank">00:06:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Good.
