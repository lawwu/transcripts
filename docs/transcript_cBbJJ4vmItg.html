You are making your heart work harder, which leads to hypertension, other issues. You are making it harder for your brain to focus and to make decisions.</p><p>You are increasing your chances of having respiratory disorders. You are increasing your chances of having anxiety and panic. I can keep going, let me keep going. So it's a disaster for your health. If you were to eat bad food, it's very bad for your health, right? That's very obvious.</p><p>If you sleep poorly, it's bad for your health, right? But people don't realize that if you breathe poorly, if you are constantly suffering from even a slight dysfunction in your breathing, it's going to impact you, and it impacts you in so many different ways.</p></div></div></body></html>
