They brought in,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_El9riy9Zjw&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and they being KBR Halliburton, they imported workers in from places like Nepal and Sri Lanka</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_El9riy9Zjw&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">and the Philippines to come in and cook food and work at this dining facility. I got curious about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_El9riy9Zjw&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.520</a></span> | <span class="t">how much it cost us as taxpayers.
