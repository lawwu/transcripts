It would have been crazy when I recorded the 2024 version of this episode almost 18 months ago to think about getting cash back. For some reason, I was just so wired to focus on points.</p><p>But I think my mindset is that if I'm getting points instead of cash back, then I'm effectively just buying those points at whatever the rate is based on what cash back I would have gotten. So for example, if I'm spending money on just something that gets no bonus on any card, obviously I could be using my Venture X card, get 2X points on everything.</p><p>But I also have a Bank of America card with Platinum Honors, which is their program that elevates all of their rewards based on how many dollars you have on deposit at Bank of America, which brings up their unlimited cash and their travel rewards and their premium rewards cards all the way up to 2.625% cash back.</p><p>And if you want to go deeper on that, I'll link to an episode in the show notes on the best cashback cards.</p></div></div></body></html>
