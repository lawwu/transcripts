And in the smallest groups, in Tasmania, you had a relatively small population, and they actually lost technology. They lost some fishing techniques. And if you have a small population, and you have some limited number of people who know a skill, they happen to die, or it happens there's like some change in circumstances that causes people not to practice or pass on that thing, and then you lose it.</p><p>And if you have few people, you're doing less innovation. The rate at which you lose technologies to some kind of local disturbance and the rate at which you create new technologies can wind up in balance. And the great change of hominids and humanity is that we wound up in a situation where we were accumulating faster than we were losing.</p><p>And as we accumulated, those technologies allowed us to expand our population, they created additional demand for intelligence, that our brains became three times as large as chimpanzees.</p></div></div></body></html>
