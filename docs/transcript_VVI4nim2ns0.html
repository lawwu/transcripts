It creates this what's right, maybe a miasma that you can't see outside. I remember a guy I talked to who was a trader at Enron, really smart guy. And he was like, after the, after the bankruptcy, he said, of course, if we're all getting paid based on creating reported earnings, and there's all this cash going out the door in order to do these deals that are creating reported earnings, and that's the culture of the entire firm, of course, it's not going to work economically.</p><p>He said, I never thought about it. It just didn't, it didn't, it didn't occur to me. And I think the more compelling the CEO, the more likely you are to have that kind of mass delusion. I mean, there's a reason cults exist, right? We are as human beings, remarkably susceptible to, quote, visionary leaders.</p><p>It's just, it's the way the human brain is wired. We, we want to believe, and especially if somebody has the ability to put a vision forward, like Jeff Skilling did at Enron, like Elizabeth Holmes did at there are enough like SBF did.</p></div></div></body></html>
