And that's in some sense, what happens when you have a large scale public monopoly that replaces private competition. But isn't that also true of rural schools? So why are urban schools often worse? There's much more competition in suburban schools, the role of public sector unions, and particularly teachers unions in these cases.</p><p>In the case of a suburban school district, the teachers union is no more empowered on the management side than they would be in the private sector. If you go into a big city school district, the teachers tend to be highly involved politically and quite capable of influencing management. You're talking about a larger group of disparate parents, many of whom have, you know, lots of challenges to face, and it becomes much harder for them to sort of organize effectively on the other side.</p></div></div></body></html>
