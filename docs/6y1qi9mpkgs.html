Now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=478" target="_blank">00:07:58.020</a></span> | <span class="t">most new cars are covered for 36 months under warranty and maintenance, and after that you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=481" target="_blank">00:08:01.340</a></span> | <span class="t">on your own.

The interesting thing to me here is, my advice</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=677" target="_blank">00:11:17.860</a></span> | <span class="t">now versus 9-12 months ago is totally different, because mortgage rates. So, John, throw up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=682" target="_blank">00:11:22.260</a></span> | <span class="t">the mortgage rates. This is Mortgage News Daily, publishes these daily. So, you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=685" target="_blank">00:11:25.500</a></span> | <span class="t">see, as of yesterday, 30-year fixed is approaching 6.5%. You can see, but they showed the 52-week</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=691" target="_blank">00:11:31.860</a></span> | <span class="t">range there is a low of 3. So, I think a year ago, you could have gotten a 30-year mortgage</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=696" target="_blank">00:11:36.180</a></span> | <span class="t">for like 2.9%, 3%. Man, it's just brutal when you think of that. So, I think if Brandon</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=702" target="_blank">00:11:42.860</a></span> | <span class="t">would have asked this question of mortgage rates at 3%, I would have said, "He's nuts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=706" target="_blank">00:11:46.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Why would you pay cash when you have a 3% mortgage that is going to be eaten away by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=711" target="_blank">00:11:51.740</a></span> | <span class="t">inflation and that's such a low hurdle rate?" Plus, you have interest deduction you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=716" target="_blank">00:11:56.140</a></span> | <span class="t">take off. So, now, with mortgage rates at 7%, that's a much higher hurdle rate. I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=720" target="_blank">00:12:00.460</a></span> | <span class="t">it actually makes more sense. So, I guess the biggest worry here would be, am I going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=724" target="_blank">00:12:04.220</a></span> | <span class="t">to miss out on some compounding in the stock market? Now, obviously, with the mortgage,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=728" target="_blank">00:12:08.340</a></span> | <span class="t">you know exactly what that return is going to be. No one knows what it's going to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=730" target="_blank">00:12:10.940</a></span> | <span class="t">in the stock market. Houses are illiquid, but if you paid it in cash, you could always</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=735" target="_blank">00:12:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">take a mortgage out or a home equity line of credit in the future if you need to, maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=738" target="_blank">00:12:18.600</a></span> | <span class="t">if rates come back down, that makes sense. And I guess the other question is, how comfortable</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=742" target="_blank">00:12:22.580</a></span> | <span class="t">are you locking up that much cash in your home? That takes your diversification down</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=746" target="_blank">00:12:26.300</a></span> | <span class="t">significantly. One of the things we talk about here a lot is regret minimization. So, maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=752" target="_blank">00:12:32.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Brandon has thought about, I don't know, pay 50% in cash for the house and invest the other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=758" target="_blank">00:12:38.180</a></span> | <span class="t">50% and split the difference somehow. There are some benefits to paying with cash. It</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=762" target="_blank">00:12:42.260</a></span> | <span class="t">puts you in a much better bargaining position. I talked a few months ago, Duncan, how I sold</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=767" target="_blank">00:12:47.380</a></span> | <span class="t">an investment property earlier this summer. The person who bought it from us bought in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=770" target="_blank">00:12:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">cash. And boy, not to pat myself on the back here, but I'm pretty sure I top ticked the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=774" target="_blank">00:12:54.820</a></span> | <span class="t">market when I sold that. But the person who bought it bought it in cash, and it was so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=778" target="_blank">00:12:58.940</a></span> | <span class="t">much easier. There's no banks to deal with. There's no credit agencies to deal with. There's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=782" target="_blank">00:13:02.460</a></span> | <span class="t">no back and forth on paperwork. When you pay in cash, you don't have to deal with any of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=785" target="_blank">00:13:05.980</a></span> | <span class="t">that stuff. So, the bargaining power goes up immediately, because the other side doesn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=789" target="_blank">00:13:09.300</a></span> | <span class="t">have to deal as much with the bank. So, it's not as much of a headache. Obviously, having</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=794" target="_blank">00:13:14.060</a></span> | <span class="t">a house fully paid off at 24 puts you in a unique position. Brandon says he's single.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=797" target="_blank">00:13:17.780</a></span> | <span class="t">What happens if, down the road, Brandon gets a spouse? And that spouse says, "You bought</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=802" target="_blank">00:13:22.280</a></span> | <span class="t">this house for how much? I don't like it. I want to be in a different one." Maybe Brandon</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=805" target="_blank">00:13:25.340</a></span> | <span class="t">could rent it out, and that income could help pay for the new mortgage. Or sell it at a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=809" target="_blank">00:13:29.740</a></span> | <span class="t">profit, maybe. So, the good news is that they're in a great financial position. I think no</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=814" target="_blank">00:13:34.360</a></span> | <span class="t">matter what you do here, you're going to be fine at 24. Especially if you continue maxing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=818" target="_blank">00:13:38.120</a></span> | <span class="t">out that 401(k) and IRA. I did a little back of the envelope here for Brandon. So, if he's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=822" target="_blank">00:13:42.260</a></span> | <span class="t">maxing out 401(k), that's $20,500 a year right now. IRA is $6,000. Those limits will change</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=828" target="_blank">00:13:48.500</a></span> | <span class="t">over time, but let's assume they don't. Let's assume Brandon, at 24, just continues to save</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=832" target="_blank">00:13:52.540</a></span> | <span class="t">that much every year. Nothing else. So, that's $26,500, from age 24 to age 60. Let's say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=839" target="_blank">00:13:59.740</a></span> | <span class="t">he earns 7% a year on that. What does he end up with, Duncan?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=844" target="_blank">00:14:04.900</a></span> | <span class="t">I've got to be honest, the firearm's going off, so I wasn't following.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=849" target="_blank">00:14:09.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Alright. That's not that loud. If he did that every year at a 7% annual return, he's going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=856" target="_blank">00:14:16.540</a></span> | <span class="t">to have like $4 million by age 60. So, I'd say don't stress too much about this decision</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=860" target="_blank">00:14:20.300</a></span> | <span class="t">either way. You're going to be fine. Go with a more psychologically pleasing answer. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=864" target="_blank">00:14:24.380</a></span> | <span class="t">either way, if you keep saving, you're going to be fine. So, if you're worried about the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=867" target="_blank">00:14:27.460</a></span> | <span class="t">stock market that much, you're 24 and you're still maxing out your retirement accounts</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=870" target="_blank">00:14:30.220</a></span> | <span class="t">and you want to pay for the house in cash, I think you're going to be fine as long as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=873" target="_blank">00:14:33.060</a></span> | <span class="t">you keep saving.

Well, we talked about that person a few weeks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=883" target="_blank">00:14:43.820</a></span> | <span class="t">ago emailed from Missouri and they were paying like $300 a month in rent. I think a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=887" target="_blank">00:14:47.300</a></span> | <span class="t">people here would be surprised to know that you could buy a house in cash for that much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=891" target="_blank">00:14:51.500</a></span> | <span class="t">and there's still places that are relatively affordable. So, obviously, this is a very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=897" target="_blank">00:14:57.620</a></span> | <span class="t">rare position. But I think with their finances so well in their mid-20s, they're probably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=901" target="_blank">00:15:01.860</a></span> | <span class="t">going to be fine either way. Just keep saving. Yeah, I'd say so. That's not too loud, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=910" target="_blank">00:15:10.100</a></span> | <span class="t">That's just them talking now.

So, for you, that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=1015" target="_blank">00:16:55.020</a></span> | <span class="t">good, because you're earning more income.

I think there's some mental accounting happening here. He mentioned, "Should my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=1490" target="_blank">00:24:50.140</a></span> | <span class="t">rollover IRA be more aggressive because it's smaller and I'm putting less into it?"

I think if anything,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=1502" target="_blank">00:25:02.620</a></span> | <span class="t">your Roth component that you're building up through these mega backdoor contributions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=1506" target="_blank">00:25:06.860</a></span> | <span class="t">should be your most aggressive because you're theoretically never have to take money out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=1511" target="_blank">00:25:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">of that.

And then my next question in terms of his concerns on performance would be, "Well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=1521" target="_blank">00:25:21.860</a></span> | <span class="t">what was it invested in that caused it to underperform?"

If that advisor can't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=1576" target="_blank">00:26:16.380</a></span> | <span class="t">do it for you, maybe you have to find a new one or come up with something on your own.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y1qi9mpkgs&t=1579" target="_blank">00:26:19.100</a></span> | <span class="t">But that's the thing for most people.
