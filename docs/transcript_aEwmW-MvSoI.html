That's semi-fast, that's semi-fast. Do we have another one? How are we doing with time? - Yeah, we have one more question. This is a question about studying for the GMAT and then at the tail end, she's also juggling job hunting. So we'll take a listen to what Lindsay has to say. - All right. - This is Lindsay. I'm a huge fan of your work. I am wondering if you could speak to two things. The first is most effective way to study for the GMAT test. I took it back in 2011. I have to retake it now that I'm applying to school again for something else because they have changed the test and there's so many guides and books in online courses out there that I don't know, I'm feeling a little overwhelmed. So if you could speak to that or like generally standardized higher education. - Jessica, can we pause here right there? - Secondly, effective-- - So let me answer her first part and then we'll get our second part if that works because GMAT, I have a simple answer for any of those standardized tests. Doing sample test under the real time conditions is by far the actual best practice. I can do real sample test and get this score under those conditions, then you will get that score in the real test. If you can't, you won't. The only thing you do is use books. I don't think you need the online courses. Get books to learn the techniques they recommend for each of the different types of sections. So like, okay, I'm gonna study these type of questions and look at the techniques. Now I'm gonna try it under time conditions. Then I'll go back and deconstruct the answers I got wrong, figure out how to answer them right, see if I'm missing any techniques. Why did I get that wrong? Was it a mistake or I didn't know how to do it? And then do it again under time conditions. And that's it. I mean, this is how I did, for example, the GRE when I was applying to graduate school in computer science, most of these schools cared only about your math section. I knew you needed a high 700s in the math to be in contention for any of these schools. They preferred 800, but I gamed it out and was like, okay, high 700s would be enough. And that's all I did. Like, okay, let me read a book about the different types of questions and the techniques they recommend. Sample test, how'd I do? Try again, try again. Okay, I'm in the high 700s. Go, took the test and we're done. So that's the way to prepare, nothing else fancy. Get in real conditions, do the test, figure out what you got wrong. Look at one book on techniques, but it's really a game of practicing. (upbeat music)</p></div></div></body></html>
