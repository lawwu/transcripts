Like what is happening? To anesthetize people. Oh, interesting. They want to feel they're learning something to put them to sleep so they can exercise and not feel like idiots occasionally to learn something. It's to keep themselves busy work of some kind. Is this to say more about the anesthetizing?</p><p>You want to feel you're imbibing the most important ideas, right? And there's very costly, tough ways to do that. Like to actually work on one of those problems as a researcher. But most people can't do that through no fault of their own. Even if they're academics, like maybe they just can't do it.</p><p>So like one of the next best things is to listen to someone who at least pretends that they've done it. And it's like, okay, it's a substitute. Like, why not? What are you supposed to do? Watch TV.</p></div></div></body></html>
