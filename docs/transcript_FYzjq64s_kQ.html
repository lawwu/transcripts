It's actually the present that determines the meaning of the past. And this is like a fundamental mindset when it comes to healing trauma, things like that, is that my past isn't what's determining who I am now. Actually, it's who I am now that determines the meaning of my past.</p><p>And the more you get really good at that, the more you can continuously transform your past in ways that it is happening for you rather than happening to you. But if you listen to most people's language, they still blame their past for why they are the way they are right now rather than taking ownership that it's actually you right now that are shaping the story, the narrative, the frame, the view of your past.</p><p>It's not the past that determines the present. It's the present that determines the past.</p></div></div></body></html>
