It's so diverse. I think people, when they think of profitable deals, they may think of credit card bonuses. That's the first one that comes to mind.</p><p>And I think credit card bonuses are very lucrative, but an aspect that people often don't think about that's also very profitable are bank signup bonuses and brokerage signup bonuses. Those can yield a lot of just straight cash, liquid cash that you can use as like a buffer for your finances.</p><p>But then there's also like a plethora of other little things, you know, saving money on cell phones, meal kits. You can find ways to try and generate spend for your credit cards so that if you're someone that's not spending a million dollars a year on your credit cards, you can still meet a lot of these signup bonuses.</p><p>It's just so many things. There's like buying groups you can participate in, reselling gift cards. It's hard, I think, to pin it down. So I think profitable deals is a good descriptor for it.</p></div></div></body></html>
