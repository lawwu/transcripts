There's the Venture One card,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">which is very similar in its name, in its look, except instead of earning 2x miles on everything,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">it earns 1.25x miles on everything.

Now, there's another card called the Venture One card for good credit and Capital One does this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=375" target="_blank">00:06:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">thing sometimes where there's a version of a card and then there's a version for good credit and a version</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=379" target="_blank">00:06:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">for students and even in some cases a version for fair credit. And you got to keep in mind that the cards</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=385" target="_blank">00:06:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">actually look very similar.

So the Venture One</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=393" target="_blank">00:06:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">rewards card for good credit is very similar to the Venture One card, except there's no signup bonus,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=399" target="_blank">00:06:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">there's no 0% intro APR, and there's no Capital One travel credit offer. So still that $0 annual fee,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=405" target="_blank">00:06:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">zero foreign transaction fee. For the purpose of the tier list in this episode, I'm not going to rank all of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=411" target="_blank">00:06:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the for good credit for students versions of the cards. I'm just going to stick to the main cards as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=416" target="_blank">00:06:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">we go through. So next, let's talk about my first card with Capital One, which is the Venture X card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=422" target="_blank">00:07:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, this card was a big splash. Tons of marketing went into it. When they originally launched it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=427" target="_blank">00:07:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">it had a welcome offer of 100,000 miles, which I know a lot of people were excited about. Right now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=432" target="_blank">00:07:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the welcome offer is 75,000 miles after spending $4,000 in three months from account opening. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=440" target="_blank">00:07:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">same welcome offer you would get with the Venture card. The main difference between the Venture card</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=445" target="_blank">00:07:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and the Venture X card is all around the benefits you get. So you're still getting 2x miles on every</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=450" target="_blank">00:07:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">purchase. But if you're spending in the Capital One travel portal, now you're going to get 10x miles on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=456" target="_blank">00:07:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">hotels and rental cars, and 5x miles on airfare and vacation rentals. It's probably worth pausing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=462" target="_blank">00:07:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">for a second to talk a little bit about travel portals. In general, the reason that I don't love</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=467" target="_blank">00:07:47.520</a></span> | <span class="t">travel portals is that when you book a flight, or you book a hotel room, often the airline or the hotel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=474" target="_blank">00:07:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">group is not going to allow you to directly manage those reservations with them. And they're going to kick</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=480" target="_blank">00:08:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you back and say, hey, if you need to change your flight, go to Capital One travel. Hey, if you need to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=484" target="_blank">00:08:04.640</a></span> | <span class="t">cancel your hotel, go to Capital One travel. So on one hand, that's a little bit frustrating. On the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=489" target="_blank">00:08:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">other hand, if you can earn 10x miles on a rental car, or 5x miles on a flight, that can be really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=494" target="_blank">00:08:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">compelling. And so I would just keep in mind what type of trip you're taking, how likely it is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=499" target="_blank">00:08:19.520</a></span> | <span class="t">it's going to need to be changed. On the hotel front, often you're not going to earn any points or elite</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=505" target="_blank">00:08:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">status with the hotel chain if you're booking a hotel through a travel portal. And so in that case,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=511" target="_blank">00:08:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">if I were booking something with Hyatt, where I'm trying to build up status, I probably wouldn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=515" target="_blank">00:08:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">book it in a travel portal. That said, if I was booking a boutique hotel that wasn't any part of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=519" target="_blank">00:08:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">a travel program, and I also found the best rate in a travel portal, I'm not going to pay more for it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=525" target="_blank">00:08:45.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I would totally have no issue booking for 10x miles in the Capital One travel portal, which can make this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=530" target="_blank">00:08:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">a great card for travel, as long as you're willing to understand those differences. If you need to change a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=536" target="_blank">00:08:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">flight in the Capital One travel portal, it's not like you can't do it, you can go in and change it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=541" target="_blank">00:09:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And in some cases, airlines will let you take over that reservation and manage it through their site.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=546" target="_blank">00:09:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But I can just say that sometimes there are some issues.

That said, there are other benefits, but just getting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=782" target="_blank">00:13:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">enough benefits to make up for the annual fee is way easier for this card than a lot of other premium</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=787" target="_blank">00:13:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">travel cards. You also get that credit every, I think, four years for TSA Pre and Global Entry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=793" target="_blank">00:13:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the other big thing is you get access to Capital One's Lounge Network. Now, unfortunately,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=799" target="_blank">00:13:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">this year in 2025, that access has changed a bit. So let me explain what that means.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=804" target="_blank">00:13:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">There are two types of access you get. You get access to Priority Pass, which is a lounge network</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=809" target="_blank">00:13:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">of over 1,000 lounges around the world. And you get access to Capital One's own lounges. Now, right now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=815" target="_blank">00:13:35.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I think they have somewhere around seven lounges, Denver, Dallas, both airports in DC, Las Vegas.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=822" target="_blank">00:13:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think LaGuardia and JFK are coming soon, or maybe they're already there. But the way the access</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=827" target="_blank">00:13:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">works is that you used to get two guests for free or one guest for their landing lounges, which right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=833" target="_blank">00:13:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">now are in Washington, Reagan, and LaGuardia in New York. But starting February, 2026, that changes and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=839" target="_blank">00:13:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">guests are no longer free with a couple of caveats. So one, this card has no fee for authorized users.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=845" target="_blank">00:14:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can add an authorized user and they can use this card as well. However, those authorized users</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=850" target="_blank">00:14:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">do not get lounge access unless you pay $125 a year. And you can do that for up to four authorized users.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=858" target="_blank">00:14:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So without guest privileges next year, that means that in order to have your partner get into a lounge,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=864" target="_blank">00:14:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">you need to add them as an authorized user. Now, if you use lounges enough, maybe that $125 fee works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=869" target="_blank">00:14:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you have children and you're hoping to get them into lounges, that's not really a great option</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=874" target="_blank">00:14:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">because I believe with Capital One, children need to be over 13 to be authorized users.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=879" target="_blank">00:14:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can either pay for that lounge access, which for children is $25 or adults is $45.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=885" target="_blank">00:14:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Or if you spend $75,000 a year on the card, then you or any authorized users now inherit free guest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=893" target="_blank">00:14:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">access of up to two guests for Capital One lounges and then one guest for the Capital One landing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=899" target="_blank">00:14:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">lounges. I believe the reason those lounges are different is that the landing lounges are a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=903" target="_blank">00:15:03.760</a></span> | <span class="t">more elevated, a little better food, and they want to keep them a little bit smaller in terms of number</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=908" target="_blank">00:15:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">of guests that come into those lounges.

So I understand that Capital One</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=917" target="_blank">00:15:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">wanted to add these restrictions, but having a premium card with no guest access unless you pay</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=923" target="_blank">00:15:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">or spend a lot on the card does feel a little bit limiting. But unlike other cards where you might</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=929" target="_blank">00:15:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">have to spend money to unlock a privilege like guesting into a lounge, at least this is a card</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=934" target="_blank">00:15:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">where you're earning 2x miles on all your spending. So if you did have large tax payments where those fees</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=939" target="_blank">00:15:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">are actually under 2%, it might actually make sense to put those tax payments on a card where you could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=945" target="_blank">00:15:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">earn 2x miles as opposed to a lot of other cards where you might only earn 1x miles on a tax payment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=951" target="_blank">00:15:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So it might actually be more feasible to use this card to meet that $7,500 spend</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=955" target="_blank">00:15:55.520</a></span> | <span class="t">if you spend a lot in a year. If you don't, I think it's going to be tough to use this card</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=959" target="_blank">00:15:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">as your primary lounge card, and there's probably other cards to look at if that's important to you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=964" target="_blank">00:16:04.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Now keep in mind, if you do meet that $75,000 of spend to unlock guest access,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=969" target="_blank">00:16:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">you get that unlocked access for the year you earn it, the following year, and until the end of January</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=974" target="_blank">00:16:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the next year.

And as you spend more and more, the limit will go up and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1216" target="_blank">00:20:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">up, similar to a lot of Amex charge cards. So for someone with a business who's spending a lot of money</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1221" target="_blank">00:20:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and doesn't want to be kind of hampered by a 10, 20, $30,000 limit, this could be a really good option.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1228" target="_blank">00:20:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, given that this card has the highest welcome offer for Capital One Miles, I just want to dig in a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1233" target="_blank">00:20:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">little bit and share how I think about some of these offers, because it does require a large</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1238" target="_blank">00:20:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">amount of spend, $30,000 in the first three months. So first off, if you look at the value of Capital One</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1243" target="_blank">00:20:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Miles, you can go to the points guy, they have a valuation series, they're using 1.85 cents. And part</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1249" target="_blank">00:20:49.520</a></span> | <span class="t">of the reason is that Capital One has a ton of amazing transfer partners, and I'll talk about that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1253" target="_blank">00:20:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">later in this episode. And because you have the flexibility to move those points to different hotels and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1258" target="_blank">00:20:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">airlines, there's so many different options for how you can make those points earn outsized value.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1264" target="_blank">00:21:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So at 1.85 cents, earning 150,000 miles could be worth $2,775. However, most cards that have huge</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1274" target="_blank">00:21:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">signup bonuses like that, think the Chase Sapphire Reserve Business, the Amex Business Platinum,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1279" target="_blank">00:21:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">you will be earning 1x on all other categories that aren't earning bonuses. So you're probably going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1285" target="_blank">00:21:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">to earn way less points on that spend to hit that bonus than you would with the VentureX business card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1292" target="_blank">00:21:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Here you're earning 2x miles. So while you do have to spend $30,000 in those first three months,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1297" target="_blank">00:21:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">you get another 60,000 miles from that spend, which is 210,000 miles total after you spend that $30,000.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1305" target="_blank">00:21:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So if those miles are worth 1.85 cents, that is a total welcome offer return of $3,885,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1312" target="_blank">00:21:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">which is effectively about 12.95% back on that $30,000 of spend. And even if you wanted to ratchet</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1320" target="_blank">00:22:00.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that back and say, I don't want to use 1.85 cents, I just want to pretend these miles are worth 1 cent,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1326" target="_blank">00:22:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that's still a $2,100 value welcome bonus, which is 7% back on your $30,000 of spend. So if you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1334" target="_blank">00:22:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">$30,000 to spend in the next three months, this is a card that would get you at a minimum 7% back on that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1341" target="_blank">00:22:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">spend if you hit the full spend.

And that also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1352" target="_blank">00:22:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">doesn't factor in the fact that those other two cards that often have 200,000, 250,000 point welcome</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1358" target="_blank">00:22:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">bonuses have fees of $695, $795 with some complicated credits to be able to reduce those fees and get that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1367" target="_blank">00:22:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">value back. Whereas the VentureX business is a $395 fee with, in my opinion, an easy $300 travel credit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1374" target="_blank">00:22:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and 10,000 miles on your account anniversary. So way easier to make that annual fee effectively</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1381" target="_blank">00:23:01.200</a></span> | <span class="t">down to zero. So big fan of the VentureX business, I'm not sure how long this elevated offer is going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1386" target="_blank">00:23:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">to last.

It's at the top,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1391" target="_blank">00:23:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">because it's one of the best bonuses right now.

It's just like the VentureX personal, except I think it has a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1400" target="_blank">00:23:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">better welcome offer, and you get a little better lounge access, all for the trade-off of no Hertz</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1406" target="_blank">00:23:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">President Circle status. So definitely an S tier card. Next on the list is the Spark Miles cards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1412" target="_blank">00:23:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I have a bit of a gripe with Capital One for the way they name cards.

I'm not sure why they don't call it the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1423" target="_blank">00:23:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">VentureBusiness card. It seems like you have Venture and VentureX, and then you have VentureX</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1428" target="_blank">00:23:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Business and Spark Miles, which is kind of effectively the business version of the VentureCard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1433" target="_blank">00:23:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">It also earns 2x miles on every purchase. It also, like the VentureCard, earns 5x miles on hotels and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1440" target="_blank">00:24:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">rental cars and Capital One travel.

So first off, the welcome</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1444" target="_blank">00:24:04.640</a></span> | <span class="t">bonus on this card is 50,000 miles on $4,500 spend in the first three months. It has the same annual fee as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1450" target="_blank">00:24:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the VentureCard of $95. But in your first year, it's actually waived. So there is no annual fee.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1455" target="_blank">00:24:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">No foreign transaction fees on the card. You do get free employee cards. You do get reimbursed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1460" target="_blank">00:24:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">on Global Entry and TSA PreCheck and access to that Premier and Lifestyle Hotel Collection.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1465" target="_blank">00:24:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">But otherwise, there aren't a lot of other benefits. Now, there is one variation of the Spark Miles card,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1470" target="_blank">00:24:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and that's the Spark Miles Select. It has the same signup bonus, but no annual fee. And instead of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1475" target="_blank">00:24:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">earning 2x miles on every purchase, it earns 1.5x miles on every purchase.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1480" target="_blank">00:24:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">No TSA Pre and Global Entry credit as well.

A lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1514" target="_blank">00:25:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">business services, lots of spending in places that aren't restaurants and dining and travel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1519" target="_blank">00:25:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's why I put this in the S tier, because as a business owner, being able to get 2x transferable</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1526" target="_blank">00:25:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">miles on all purchases is just really incredible and differentiated amongst a lot of other cards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1532" target="_blank">00:25:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">That said, if I'm looking at the Spark Business 1.5x miles card, I'm putting that down in the B tier,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1538" target="_blank">00:25:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">because getting 1.5x is pretty comparable to a lot of other options.

And then there is the for student version of this card, which has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1936" target="_blank">00:32:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">similar requirements to the saver card for students, also no intro APR, but it does have a small welcome</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1941" target="_blank">00:32:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">offer of $100 on $300 spend in three months. Then there is the Quicksilver One card, which you'd think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1948" target="_blank">00:32:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">might be different given that there was a saver and a saver one card and they had different earnings. No,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1954" target="_blank">00:32:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">this one's the same earnings, no welcome offer, no intro APR, but this one actually has a $39 annual fee.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1960" target="_blank">00:32:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">They do say they do credit line reviews, but it says this is for fair credit. Still, again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1965" target="_blank">00:32:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">with Capital One and the naming, I'm always confused. Instead of calling this the for fair credit version,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1971" target="_blank">00:32:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">they give it a different name called Quicksilver One. So I'll treat it like a separate card, but it's not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1976" target="_blank">00:32:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">really that different. And then there's also a Quicksilver secured card, which actually isn't a credit card,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1981" target="_blank">00:33:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">that has no welcome offer, no intro APR, no annual fee, but you have to make a refundable deposit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1986" target="_blank">00:33:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So when I look at these cards, I think about the Quicksilver card. I'm putting that at the C tier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1990" target="_blank">00:33:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And by the way, this tier list goes from S at the top all the way down to D tier. Think of it as a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=1995" target="_blank">00:33:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">grading system with S for, I don't know, star, special. I don't actually know the origin of the S.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2001" target="_blank">00:33:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And putting a card out there like the Quicksilver card that earns one and a half percent on everything,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2005" target="_blank">00:33:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">it's just not that compelling. It's a C tier card for me. But putting it out there with a annual fee,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2011" target="_blank">00:33:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">the Quicksilver One card, obviously the card is not targeting someone who could be eligible for these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2017" target="_blank">00:33:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">other cards. But even the secured version of this card has no annual fee and the same earnings. So I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2022" target="_blank">00:33:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">think the Capital One Quicksilver One card is a D tier card for me. Now, moving over to the business</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2026" target="_blank">00:33:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">side of cash back, you've got the Spark Cash cards. These are similar to the Quicksilver cards,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2031" target="_blank">00:33:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">except they actually go all the way up to 2%. There is no 2% cash back card on the personal side.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2036" target="_blank">00:33:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So the one I'll start with is the Spark Cash card. It's the Spark 2% cash version. You get 2% back on all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2043" target="_blank">00:34:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">purchases. You also get 5% back on hotels and rental cars through Capital One Travel. There is a bonus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2049" target="_blank">00:34:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">right now of $1,000 when you spend $10,000 in the first three months. So reasonable bonus there,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2056" target="_blank">00:34:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">right? You're getting 10% back on that spend. I like that. The annual fee is $95, but it's waived</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2062" target="_blank">00:34:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">for the first year. There's no foreign transaction fees and you get free employee cards. So overall,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2067" target="_blank">00:34:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">as a business owner, a 2% back card on everything is pretty good. I would rather have 2X Miles.

So to me, it kind of comes down to whether you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2213" target="_blank">00:36:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">want to pay that annual fee of $150 for the extra points, whether the benefits mean anything to you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2220" target="_blank">00:37:00.160</a></span> | <span class="t">how you think about the card long term. I do have this card, I did open this card when there was a really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2225" target="_blank">00:37:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">large welcome bonus. But as far as which card I'm keeping for a longer period of time, it's the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2230" target="_blank">00:37:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">VentureX business card. And you can only have one charge card with Capital One. So you can't have the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2235" target="_blank">00:37:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Spark Cash Plus and the VentureX business card at the same time either. So keep that in mind if you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2240" target="_blank">00:37:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">applying for one, and then you're thinking about the other, you definitely won't get approved for both.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2244" target="_blank">00:37:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">There are two other variations of the Spark cards. There's the Spark 1.5% cash select, and that is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2251" target="_blank">00:37:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">one and a half percent back on everything card with no annual fee. The welcome bonus is $500 on $4,500</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2258" target="_blank">00:37:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">in the first three months. And then there's the Spark 1% cash classic card, which is for fair credit,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2267" target="_blank">00:37:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">has no welcome offer, just earns a flat 1% back, but has no annual fee. So when I think about these on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2272" target="_blank">00:37:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the tier list, I think the Spark business 2% cash plus is an A tier card. Because it's a charge card,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2280" target="_blank">00:38:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you're able to get a much higher limit, and there's a much more lucrative welcome offer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2285" target="_blank">00:38:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So I like that. I think if paired with a miles earning card, that's great. There aren't a ton</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2290" target="_blank">00:38:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">of 2% everything cards out there for businesses, but there are some. So the Spark 2% cash card that is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2297" target="_blank">00:38:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">very similar, but has a lower welcome offer and not a charge card, I'll put it the B tier. I think if there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2303" target="_blank">00:38:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">was a A minus B plus tier, those cards would be a lot closer. But if I compare them head to head,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2308" target="_blank">00:38:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I'd prefer to have the higher welcome offer. And I think I'd prefer to have a charge card over a credit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2313" target="_blank">00:38:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">card. Then the Spark 1.5% cash card would be a C tier. And then the Spark classic card earning 1%</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2319" target="_blank">00:38:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">would be a D tier. I think those speak for themselves. They're not earning a ton. There are better cards out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2323" target="_blank">00:38:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">there. I'm not interested in them. So that's the majority of the Capital One cards that aren't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2329" target="_blank">00:38:49.680</a></span> | <span class="t">co-branded. There is one card that for whatever reason, when you go to look at cards on their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2333" target="_blank">00:38:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">website, it is the top card. It's the first one they show you. And it's the Platinum Master card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2339" target="_blank">00:38:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">It has no annual fee and best I can tell it earns no rewards. And so I feel like it's at least worth</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2345" target="_blank">00:39:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">mentioning this card, even though normally I wouldn't include it only because Capital One puts</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2350" target="_blank">00:39:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">it at the top of their list. But for me, that is a D tier card that earns nothing. And I don't know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2355" target="_blank">00:39:15.600</a></span> | <span class="t">why it's promoted so heavily, but I do know that it is a for fair credit card. So I assume it's probably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2361" target="_blank">00:39:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">for people who can't earn cards with more rewards. But if you look at the Capital One lineup, there are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2365" target="_blank">00:39:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">other cards for people with fair credit that do earn rewards. So this has got to be the worst of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2371" target="_blank">00:39:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">all of them. But if someone knows what I'm missing, I would love to know. Capital One also has a ton of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2376" target="_blank">00:39:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">co-branded cards with a lot of different retailers. And I was going to exclude all of them because none</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2381" target="_blank">00:39:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">of them really stood out as interesting ones that would make sense to get if you weren't really,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2386" target="_blank">00:39:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">really tied into that retailer's ecosystem. But I do think it's worth mentioning just one of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2391" target="_blank">00:39:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And technically, it's probably worth mentioning four of them. There is the Williams-Sonoma card,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2395" target="_blank">00:39:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the Pottery Barn card, the West Elm card, and the key rewards card. And the most interesting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2400" target="_blank">00:40:00.160</a></span> | <span class="t">thing about the fact that there are four of them is that best I can tell, they are all pretty much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2404" target="_blank">00:40:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">identical. I imagine the reason they're different is maybe they're opened in those individual stores,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2409" target="_blank">00:40:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and maybe those stores get different bonuses based on how many cards they open. I have no idea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2413" target="_blank">00:40:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I can't tell what's different about any of them. So I'm just going to focus on the Williams-Sonoma</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2418" target="_blank">00:40:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">one, but assume the same thing applies to Pottery Barn, West Elm, and the generic key rewards card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2423" target="_blank">00:40:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">The reason I bring it up is that it is a 4% back on groceries, food delivery, and restaurants,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2430" target="_blank">00:40:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">which is actually not a bad rate of return. It also earns 5% back at Williams-Sonoma brands. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2437" target="_blank">00:40:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">everything I mentioned, plus Mark and Graham, rejuvenation, maybe there's a couple other ones,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2441" target="_blank">00:40:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">like Pottery Barn Kids in there, and then 1% back on everything else. So I don't want to spend a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2447" target="_blank">00:40:47.520</a></span> | <span class="t">time on this card, but 4% cash back on groceries, restaurants, and food delivery is pretty interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2453" target="_blank">00:40:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">With one caveat, you earn key rewards. You don't actually earn direct cash back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2458" target="_blank">00:40:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're spending $20,000 a year on these categories, groceries, dining, you'd have to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2464" target="_blank">00:41:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">spending $800 a year at Williams-Sonoma Pottery Barn, West Elm to be able to truly cash out that $800.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2471" target="_blank">00:41:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">It's actually $825 because every year on your birthday, you get $25 on top of that and free</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2476" target="_blank">00:41:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">shipping. So if you spend money at those stores, it's not just rewarding to those stores, it's also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2483" target="_blank">00:41:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">rewarding to groceries, food, and restaurants, which is rare for a co-branded card. I think the Verizon</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2489" target="_blank">00:41:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Visa is a similar card that actually has really elevated good earnings.

So for that card, I'll put it at the B tier because 4% on categories</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2500" target="_blank">00:41:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">like that is really compelling. It can't be any higher because that cash back only works if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2506" target="_blank">00:41:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">spend 4% of your spend on those categories shopping at those Williams-Sonoma stores.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2511" target="_blank">00:41:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So the other co-branded cards that I left out, the REI, Kohl's, Cabela's, Bass Pro, BJ's,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2517" target="_blank">00:41:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">they all have little to no signup bonus. The Williams-Sonoma card does have a welcome offer of 10%</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2522" target="_blank">00:42:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">back on the Williams-Sonoma purchases in your first 30 days. So interesting if you're about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2526" target="_blank">00:42:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">to spend a ton of money at any of those stores, could make sense, could even keep it around for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2531" target="_blank">00:42:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">grocery, food, and delivery as long as you're spending enough on a regular basis at those stores</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2536" target="_blank">00:42:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to make use of that cash back. On all the other cards, they all earn about 1% to 7.5% at their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2542" target="_blank">00:42:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">respective stores, but only 1% to 1.5% everywhere else. So they really only make sense at those stores,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2550" target="_blank">00:42:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">which is why I separated the Williams-Sonoma card because it could make sense for other purchases.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2554" target="_blank">00:42:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">But some of them, notably the Cabela's and Bass Pro cards, they only go up to 5% off at their own</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2561" target="_blank">00:42:41.280</a></span> | <span class="t">store if you spend $25,000 a year. If you don't, they're 3% off if you spend $10,000. Otherwise,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2569" target="_blank">00:42:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">it's just a 2% off card at those stores and 1% everywhere else. To me, that seems absolutely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2574" target="_blank">00:42:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">crazy, right? You could get just a 2% everything card. And then if you go above and beyond and spend</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2580" target="_blank">00:43:00.160</a></span> | <span class="t">$10,000 at the retailer, you only get an extra 1% back on the spend at that store. So $100. If you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2587" target="_blank">00:43:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">spend $25,000, you could get an extra 3% back. So it's starting to be a little bit more interesting,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2593" target="_blank">00:43:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">but really for a small niche of people who spend well over $25,000 a year at Cabela's or Bass Pro. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2600" target="_blank">00:43:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I think there are people in that camp, but there are a lot of other cards that I think are more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2604" target="_blank">00:43:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">rewarding, which is why I'm not talking about them here. That's a lot of cards. Let's jump in to talk</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2609" target="_blank">00:43:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">about the Capital One ecosystem. So a few things to know about all cards in general. So I didn't talk</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2614" target="_blank">00:43:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">a ton about travel and purchase protections for those cards for a couple reasons. Mainly that Capital One</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2620" target="_blank">00:43:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">doesn't always specify whether they're cards or visas or MasterCards. And this is kind of interesting,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2626" target="_blank">00:43:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but if you go on the website and you look at all the pictures of the cards,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2629" target="_blank">00:43:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">you'll notice that it's not specified. And if you look up what are the travel purchase</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2632" target="_blank">00:43:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">protections on certain cards, they'll send you to a link which says for Visa signature cards,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2638" target="_blank">00:43:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">here's the travel benefits. For World Elite MasterCard, click here. But they don't actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2642" target="_blank">00:44:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">say which one you're going to get in advance. And I've heard stories of people getting a MasterCard</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2648" target="_blank">00:44:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">version and then later changing it to a Visa version. And so I don't want to talk a lot about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2652" target="_blank">00:44:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">the travel and purchase protections. That said, almost all the cards I mentioned do have an extended warranty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2657" target="_blank">00:44:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">protection and not much else. However, the Venture X card does link out to the Visa Infinite benefits.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2664" target="_blank">00:44:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So I have one, you are getting a Visa Infinite card, at least that's what it says on the website. It makes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2669" target="_blank">00:44:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">it pretty clear, which means you do get a lot more coverage for the Venture X card. You're getting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2673" target="_blank">00:44:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">primary rental coverage, trip delay and cancellation, lost luggage, purchase protection, extended warranty,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2679" target="_blank">00:44:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">cell phone protection. So that's great. But as for the other cards, I think you really have to go look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2684" target="_blank">00:44:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">at the guide to benefits. And I wouldn't be opening any of these Capital One cards except a Venture X card,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2689" target="_blank">00:44:49.520</a></span> | <span class="t">primarily for their purchase protections and travel protections, because it's just hard to know what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2694" target="_blank">00:44:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you're going to get. One thing you are going to get with all your Capital One cards, at least all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2697" target="_blank">00:44:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">ones I've used, is virtual card numbers, which is awesome. So if you're checking out on some website and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2703" target="_blank">00:45:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">you feel like it's a little sketchy, you can go create a virtual card on the website, or you can use their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2707" target="_blank">00:45:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Eno browser extension. And that lets you create virtual card numbers on the fly. I've done that a ton of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2713" target="_blank">00:45:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">times. Or for sites where you're getting a seven day trial, and you're not sure how easy it'll be to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2718" target="_blank">00:45:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">cancel, you can use a virtual card and set that card to expire the next day. So that if that trial is hard to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2725" target="_blank">00:45:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">cancel, you could just leave it go and not worry about it hitting your card. Another cool benefit is that in 19</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2731" target="_blank">00:45:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">different states and pretty much most major cities in America, Capital One has cafes, they have 55 of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=2737" target="_blank">00:45:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">them.

On the hotel side, there are only</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3339" target="_blank">00:55:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">three options. You get Choice Privileges, Accor, and Wyndham. And I'll be honest, not that compelling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3346" target="_blank">00:55:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">The main one here that's kind of stand out is that Wyndham has an ability to earn outsized value</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3351" target="_blank">00:55:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">through booking Vacasa vacation rentals.

On the Accor side, Accor points are kind of fixed in value. So there's not a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3361" target="_blank">00:56:01.520</a></span> | <span class="t">opportunity for upside here. And on Choice, you're probably better off cashing out your Capital One</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3366" target="_blank">00:56:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">miles for one cent and buying Choice points than transferring just one to one, to be honest,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3372" target="_blank">00:56:12.720</a></span> | <span class="t">because they're often on sale for half a cent. I don't mind Choice as a partner, maybe if you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3377" target="_blank">00:56:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">City or Wells Fargo, where you get two Choice points for every one point you transfer. But with Capital One,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3384" target="_blank">00:56:24.720</a></span> | <span class="t">it's one to one.

So I would stick to the airline partners.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3390" target="_blank">00:56:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And as for transfer bonuses, Capital One has some. So in 2023 and 2024, there were six. There have been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3396" target="_blank">00:56:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">four year to date in 2025.

And it seems like there's one every other month. So while it happens, it doesn't happen</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3417" target="_blank">00:56:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">that often, not as much as some other programs. But it doesn't happen enough that I would wait for it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3423" target="_blank">00:57:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">But it happens frequently enough that maybe you'll get lucky and a trip you're planning happens right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3427" target="_blank">00:57:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">as a bonus hits and you can get a little bit of upside there. Where I think Capital One Miles really,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3431" target="_blank">00:57:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">really shine is that you can combine them across your cards, but you can also combine them between</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3438" target="_blank">00:57:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">people.

There's no limits or expirations like City. So I think it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3448" target="_blank">00:57:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">really, really awesome for the ability to move points between people, pull points for trips</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3455" target="_blank">00:57:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">with families, especially if you have a large extended family and you want to all book out of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3459" target="_blank">00:57:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">your account to make it a little easier, or maybe you have status with an airline you're transferring to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3464" target="_blank">00:57:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">That is one amazing feature of Capital One is the ability to move miles by anyone. Unfortunately,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3469" target="_blank">00:57:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">you have to do it by the phone, but you can do it.

Some people say, no, it's still two. But you can't open tons and tons of Capital One cards,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3518" target="_blank">00:58:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">especially with one every six months. It's difficult. Also, you can only have one charge card,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3522" target="_blank">00:58:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">as I mentioned earlier. So Spark Cash Plus or VentureX Business. Now you can have a lot more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3527" target="_blank">00:58:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">business cards.

Sometimes you can move credit from one card to an existing card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3536" target="_blank">00:58:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Seems like sometimes you can't.

So for me,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3563" target="_blank">00:59:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">if I wanted to product change my VentureX, they said I could move it to a Venture, a VentureOne or a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3567" target="_blank">00:59:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Quicksilver.

Amex has the Blue Business Plus,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3722" target="_blank">01:02:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but it has a cap of $50,000 of spend a year. And then there is this Wells Fargo Signify business</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3727" target="_blank">01:02:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">cash card, which is a 2% card that may be able to transfer points over to the autograph or the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3732" target="_blank">01:02:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">autograph journey. But Wells Fargo is among the least interesting points currency out there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3737" target="_blank">01:02:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So I love that. I also love getting high limits on these cards compared to what you might get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3743" target="_blank">01:02:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">with a 2x card, like the City Double Cash or the Wells Fargo Active Cash, which also, by the way,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3748" target="_blank">01:02:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">requires you to have another card to tie it to. But coming back to my point that this uncapped 2x</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3753" target="_blank">01:02:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">points card is interesting, I actually ran the numbers and it is the best single card. If you look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3759" target="_blank">01:02:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">at the Bureau of Labor Statistics data, I applied the average spending patterns for households with,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3765" target="_blank">01:02:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it was a household annual income of $100,000 plus, to every single card. And the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3771" target="_blank">01:02:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">closest runner-ups to earning 2x miles on everything were the Amex Gold, where you get 4x on dining and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3778" target="_blank">01:02:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">grocery and 1x on everything else, and the City Premier, where you get 3x on dining, grocery, gas,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3784" target="_blank">01:03:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">air travel, and hotels, and 1x on everything else. But the average for the average family with the data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3789" target="_blank">01:03:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I used was earning 1.74 on the Amex Gold and 1.65 on the City Premier. So if you want one single card,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3797" target="_blank">01:03:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and you don't want to play games, and you just want to maximize your miles and points earning with one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3802" target="_blank">01:03:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">card, being able to do that with Capital One on the Venture, the Venture X, the Venture X Business,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3807" target="_blank">01:03:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">the Spark Miles, there's multiple cards that can do it. Really incredible for getting one card. Now, what's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3814" target="_blank">01:03:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">crazy is that that one card actually does better than the best two card combo from Amex or Chase.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3820" target="_blank">01:03:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you look at the best two card combo from Amex, the average earning is 1.96x. So you're just shy of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3825" target="_blank">01:03:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">earning 2x on everything. And if you look at it on Chase, it's 1.91x. Now, if you want to look at two</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3831" target="_blank">01:03:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">card combos from Capital One, you'd be looking at the Venture or the Venture X paired with the Saver</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3837" target="_blank">01:03:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">card, and you'd have a $95 annual fee. And I calculated an average earning of 2.26x on everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3846" target="_blank">01:04:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, if you compare that to Wells Fargo or Citi, they're slightly better at 2.32x and 2.33x on all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3852" target="_blank">01:04:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">your spending. So I could make a case that the best two card combo probably is the Citi Strata Premier</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3858" target="_blank">01:04:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and the Citi Double Cash. However, I much prefer Capital One as a platform from a technology standpoint.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3864" target="_blank">01:04:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I much prefer Capital One from a limits on cards standpoint. And even more, that doesn't factor in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3870" target="_blank">01:04:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">how much you'd earn if you booked some of your travel in the Capital One travel portal. Because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3876" target="_blank">01:04:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">part of the reason that those other brands win is that they have 3x on travel or flights or hotels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3882" target="_blank">01:04:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">If you were booking flights in Capital One travel for 10x or hotels in Capital One travel for 5x with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3887" target="_blank">01:04:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the Venture X, you would blow that out of the water. So even as a two card combo, I think Capital One stands</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3892" target="_blank">01:04:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">up to all the best out there. As a one card combo, it is the best. And the main thing that is less exciting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3899" target="_blank">01:04:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">is that it's harder to get approved, harder to have a lot of cards there. They don't have as many cards</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3904" target="_blank">01:05:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and welcome bonuses as a Chase or Amex, and they don't have any really major unique transfer partner</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3909" target="_blank">01:05:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">differentiation like you might get AA from Citi, Hyatt from Chase, or United from Chase. However,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3916" target="_blank">01:05:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">while I would much rather have Chase or Bilt points than Capital One points, I would much rather have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3922" target="_blank">01:05:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">2x Capital One points over 1 to 1.5x Chase or Bilt or Citi or Amex or any other points. So the fact that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3928" target="_blank">01:05:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">can earn 2x points with the Venture, the Venture X, the Spark Miles cards, I think that makes them the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-R0N4j0usU&t=3935" target="_blank">01:05:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">best catch-all cards out there.
