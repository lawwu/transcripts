So first of all, I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=46" target="_blank">00:00:46.740</a></span> | <span class="t">would like to talk about why prompting is hard. And to understand why prompting is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=53" target="_blank">00:00:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">hard, we should understand what prompting is in the first place. So this model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=57" target="_blank">00:00:57.660</a></span> | <span class="t">estimate the probability of each subsequent word given the preceding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=62" target="_blank">00:01:02.460</a></span> | <span class="t">words. So in a way, a well-crafted prompt can increase the probability of generated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=68" target="_blank">00:01:08.820</a></span> | <span class="t">desired and accurate phrases. Due to attention mechanisms in large language</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=75" target="_blank">00:01:15.600</a></span> | <span class="t">models, the models can focus on specific parts of the input text, and so effective</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=82" target="_blank">00:01:22.140</a></span> | <span class="t">prompts ensure that the attention is directed properly for desired outputs, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=87" target="_blank">00:01:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">and so it's important to incorporate task-specific keywords and context and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">examples within the prompt to activate the relevant portions of the model's internal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">knowledge. And lastly, prompting leads to better results because without the need of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=104" target="_blank">00:01:44.900</a></span> | <span class="t">like computational, like other compute, you just like, without like model retraining, so you can like leverage</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.600</a></span> | <span class="t">inference time test compute for this. And so like why prompting is hard? And I think I found, based on like my conversations with customers and like developers, I think prompting is hard because of like three different reasons. First, people know, humans know what they want, but they don't know how to get the best performance from the model. And I think that's what we're going to focus on today. The second reason is that they vaguely know what they want, but they don't know how to explain what they want, but they don't know how to explain what they want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So they don't know how to explain the best to explain the best to the model. And so the model gets confused what the human wants from the task. And the third reason is like they don't know what they want. So the humans don't know what they want. So it's pretty bad.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's hard for the model to understand. So basic strategies that you can like, if you find yourself, like you kind of really know what the task is, just provide a bunch of examples. And the model would be good at inferring what you're trying to do, just based on like examples. And the examples may be, should be diverse and should encapsulate a bunch of like age cases.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Try to explain as you would have to explain to a five-year-old or like very, you know, in a very simple terms. And I think what I found is that like as you have to like be able to like iterate a lot and like spend a lot of time just prompting. And in a way, based on my experience, for example, as like research engineer, I spend the majority of pairing with people just collaborating on the prompts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.580</a></span> | <span class="t">In the past, I was thinking like how my main experience with the word prompt was only in the creative writing classes. I graded from Berkeley, and I took some like creative writing classes. And we usually have like exercises, like prompting exercises, right. And so we often forget that prompting language models is actually an act of creative writing. And I see people get annoyed, like why their prompts just don't work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.580</a></span> | <span class="t">But in most cases, I think it just means that people lack some kind of like originality or creativity to think of like new novel ways, how to make it work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.580</a></span> | <span class="t">I recently wrote a blog post about the cultures of writing. And one of the points that I'm making in the blog post is that prompting becomes like a new form of writing for any research engineer and like scientist who engages in daily, this kind of writing requires forming hypotheses. So you have to ask the model, okay, can the model do this? And you want to test that. Can the model self-correct its responses?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes or no. And so you start trying like forming the hypothesis. Next, you test certain assumptions that you make about the model. And if as you iterate more, you kind of like get new insights or like, oh, yeah, the model's pretty good at this particular thing, but it's not super good at another thing to achieve this task. So you gain more clarity about like what's what's the strength and the weaknesses are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.580</a></span> | <span class="t">I wanted to start with like overall broad like writing principles. Because ultimately prompting is like writing, right? So the goal is to write prompts that clearly communicate the task objective, while providing just enough constraints and guidance to steer the model towards producing high quality and relevant outputs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there are like four to six kind of like writing guidelines that I think I found effective, especially working with like Claude. So the read, maybe to clarify how Claude is different from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.580</a></span> | <span class="t">or GPT or GPT models. I think with Claude models, I think with Claude, you have to almost treat it as like another human. So you have to like explain things to a five-year-old. Or like you have to be elaborate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And like, I will share like more examples on like how to do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=347" target="_blank">00:05:47.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And I will share like more examples on like how to do that. And I will share like more examples on like how to do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.580</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think that's like a distinguishing feature from like GPT models from like GPT models from Claude.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=356" target="_blank">00:05:56.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first principle is clarity. Like use simple, unambiguous language in your prompts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you have to have to almost treat it as like another human. So you have to like explain things to a five-year-old.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Or like you have to be elaborate. And like I will share like more examples on like how to do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=372" target="_blank">00:06:12.580</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think that's like a distinguishing feature from like GPT models from Claude.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=379" target="_blank">00:06:19.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first principle is clarity. Like use simple, unambiguous language in your prompts. Avoid confusing syntax or vague phrases that could confuse the model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.580</a></span> | <span class="t">The second is conciseness. Keep prompts short and focused. Include only key information that the model needs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=399" target="_blank">00:06:39.580</a></span> | <span class="t">The third is coherence. Logically structure the prompts with context at the beginning and clear task at the end.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=408" target="_blank">00:06:48.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Consistency. Stick to similar formatting. If you use XML tags, use it consistently in the prompt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=417" target="_blank">00:06:57.580</a></span> | <span class="t">If you use certain like terminology, do not like kind of like put the model of distribution basically. So make it consistent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=427" target="_blank">00:07:07.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Directions provide like genre, length, style, or any like guidelines. Guidance to direct the model's response.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=434" target="_blank">00:07:14.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Ground prompts with examples, sources. Make the model to quote itself. Or like if you have like long document in the context, make it to quote from the document to support the argument.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=450" target="_blank">00:07:30.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Or help the models to form, support the arguments from like search results or like other supporting contextual information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=461" target="_blank">00:07:41.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Engaging use diverse edge cases examples. Very useful for future prompting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=466" target="_blank">00:07:46.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Now I'm going to go through certain like tasks that I thought would be interesting and see how you can use Claude in those specific tasks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=482" target="_blank">00:08:02.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first case is obviously a recommendation system. As of last year, last year I made this project in Turalia.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=491" target="_blank">00:08:11.580</a></span> | <span class="t">I used clip to kind of like, so I scraped a bunch of like images and like clothing items from different brands.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=508" target="_blank">00:08:28.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And I used text as like an actual search engine. So you can say like James Bond girl. And you can do dress. And in a way you get like results that are like dress in the style of James Bond.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=527" target="_blank">00:08:47.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Or you can do like futuristic, a thorough outfit. And it's like more like vibes based search. And you can like go and look at the shop itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=539" target="_blank">00:08:59.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=540" target="_blank">00:09:00.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=542" target="_blank">00:09:02.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Clip is contrastive language to image model trained by open AI. It's open source, but it's basically, they provide embeddings for text and images. So you can like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=556" target="_blank">00:09:16.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And the way it works here is like you embed images and you embed, um, text results. And so what you can do is that you can like do a cosine similarity to find the most similar, um, items based on your database for the user query.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=573" target="_blank">00:09:33.580</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know if that's clear. Let me know if you have questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=576" target="_blank">00:09:36.580</a></span> | <span class="t">It's the same thing as multimodal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=578" target="_blank">00:09:38.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Um, I think you can read the paper clip. Yeah. Um, if you're interested.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=599" target="_blank">00:09:59.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So I was, I was thinking like, okay, how could I use Claude in this project to curate relevant recommendations based on the user's requests? And that's the task.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=612" target="_blank">00:10:12.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So in a way you have like users input, let's say dress in the style of Emma Chamberlain blazer, like in the great Gatsby movie and outfit with a futuristic vibe for the Met Gala.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=625" target="_blank">00:10:25.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And on the other side, you have like image to text database, um, with images and their labels. And the labels can be produced either by like the original source or you can use like multimodal models to like come up with labels based on the images.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=640" target="_blank">00:10:40.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and so the task of the Claude is to curate, like based on the labels from the images, decide whether this like item relevant, should I recommend this to the user?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=654" target="_blank">00:10:54.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Is this accurate? Like does it matches the, uh, users per like, can I personalize this? Um, and so if you can look at the,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=666" target="_blank">00:11:06.580</a></span> | <span class="t">very simple curation strategy, um, for the prompt, you can just like zero shot at like, I need you to decide whether the item is relevant to the user query. Here's the user query. Um, here's the item description. Um, is it item relevant or should, should be recommended to the user based on the user's query and say yes or no, please to write the answer in answer tags.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=695" target="_blank">00:11:35.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, let's unpack this. First of all, Claude really likes XML tags, really loves XML tags. I think like, this is like number one, not mistake, but like, um, one thing that people miss, they don't like put anything in XML tags. And so they don't have like very high, like good performance. So everything like, yeah, I do love XML tags. So you should like put everything in XML tags. And, um, with XML tags, it should like be consistent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=724" target="_blank">00:12:04.580</a></span> | <span class="t">like be consistent. So what is user query item. And you can be very descriptive. I can share like more examples later on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=731" target="_blank">00:12:11.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and here in a way you like the way you interact with cloud is like, you can see the language here. I need you to decide whether the item is relevant. It's almost feels like you talk to a human. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=746" target="_blank">00:12:26.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, yeah. So, uh, this XML thing recently only came out like maybe like a month or two ago from official and dropping advice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=757" target="_blank">00:12:37.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, really? Is this something that was like intentionally trained for or you discovered it after?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=763" target="_blank">00:12:43.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, I think it was, uh, I mean, we tried to XML, XML formatting was the first formatting that we like kind of like fine tuned on. Like, um, later on, we discovered, you know, customers need like markdown or like need,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=781" target="_blank">00:13:01.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Claude needs to like use JSON formatting. So like we kind of like learn from customers, but originally it was like XML formatting. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=790" target="_blank">00:13:10.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So is that mostly because of the fine tuning or is that because you had a training set that had tons of XML stuff in it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=796" target="_blank">00:13:16.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, I think it's kind of both. Yeah. Um, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=805" target="_blank">00:13:25.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Close XML tags. Yeah. I don't know. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=816" target="_blank">00:13:36.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh yeah. Sorry. I had a mistake. Yes, I have. Um, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=823" target="_blank">00:13:43.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, yeah. And so like one, one good thing about the XML tags is like, it's really easy to extract, right? Like the strings inside it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=831" target="_blank">00:13:51.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And Claude is pretty good at like, um, I can like say like, don't put anything in XML tags.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=839" target="_blank">00:13:59.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So sometimes like Claude will like say, here's information, blah, blah, blah, blah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=842" target="_blank">00:14:02.580</a></span> | <span class="t">But then if you ask, just like write the answer in like this tags, Claude will not put any additional information,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=849" target="_blank">00:14:09.580</a></span> | <span class="t">which is one of the most annoying thing was like language models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=852" target="_blank">00:14:12.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So here's the results, uh, that I put, um, this is through Claude at AI interface.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=860" target="_blank">00:14:20.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and so yeah, you can see like, is this item relevant? Uh, says no.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=866" target="_blank">00:14:26.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Is this item relevant? Yes. But I don't think that's like a hundred percent like, um, you know, perfect system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=877" target="_blank">00:14:37.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's very like zero shots. So basically you can like iterate and we'll try to iterate more in this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=882" target="_blank">00:14:42.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so number two is that like when, uh, you put, you ask the model to take some time to think whether the item is relevant or not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=894" target="_blank">00:14:54.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, in thoughts tags based on the criteria above, um, and you kind of like let the model think, um, a little bit more, um, with its reasoning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=904" target="_blank">00:15:04.580</a></span> | <span class="t">With its reasoning. And then, uh, this is like basically chain of thoughts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=909" target="_blank">00:15:09.580</a></span> | <span class="t">You can also add like criteria. Uh, so as a part of your critique, consider the following criteria.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=917" target="_blank">00:15:17.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And so if you want to like steer the model on like, does the item match the specific attributes requested by user?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=923" target="_blank">00:15:23.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Like help the model to like think kind of, kind of like think through like what means, what does it mean to like recommend an item to the user?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=932" target="_blank">00:15:32.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Does the item match the season or whether conditions match it in the user's query?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=937" target="_blank">00:15:37.580</a></span> | <span class="t">For example, you should not recommend winter coats during summer seasons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=941" target="_blank">00:15:41.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So like in the criteria, you can like give more examples, more elaborate examples.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=946" target="_blank">00:15:46.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, another thing that you iterate on is like, not just like give answer yes or no, but you can like based on your critique score,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=956" target="_blank">00:15:56.580</a></span> | <span class="t">whether the item should be recommended or not, where one is least to be recommended and 10 is highly recommended and put the final score in score tags.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=966" target="_blank">00:16:06.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And so how does it work? Uh, so, um, here like user query, James Bond blazer, um, item, which I took from, um, um, I think it was some brand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=981" target="_blank">00:16:21.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and Claude would like start like thoughts tags. Um, overall, it seems like very relevant and the final score is nine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=992" target="_blank">00:16:32.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and here's another example. I want to dress in the style of the great Gatsby movie. Um, here's the item braided cord, cropped waist coast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1001" target="_blank">00:16:41.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And the critique is basically, uh, the item is not appropriate for the user needs based on the context clues in the query.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1008" target="_blank">00:16:48.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, it doesn't like, you know, match the attributes of the great Gatsby movie.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1012" target="_blank">00:16:52.580</a></span> | <span class="t">It like tries to like have like some reasoning. And so the score is two, and you can be a little bit more elaborate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1019" target="_blank">00:16:59.580</a></span> | <span class="t">This is like very simple, like iteration, um, on, on that. Do you guys have any questions? Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1026" target="_blank">00:17:06.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So one interesting thing that I saw, I mean, there was the XML tags now that were closed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1031" target="_blank">00:17:11.580</a></span> | <span class="t">My friend, he is not a native English speaker. His prompts are always in, in very kind of funny English,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1038" target="_blank">00:17:18.580</a></span> | <span class="t">but he structures them really well and they work really well despite the English being very incorrect. Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1045" target="_blank">00:17:25.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. Why, why does that work?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1047" target="_blank">00:17:27.580</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's just the morals are like pretty good at like knowledge transfer between like languages or like can infer very well on like the user's intent. Um, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1060" target="_blank">00:17:40.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. I don't have like pretty clear answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1063" target="_blank">00:17:43.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So that text with one syntax mistake looks close enough with the text with the right syntax.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1070" target="_blank">00:17:50.580</a></span> | <span class="t">The probability of the real answer is close in four cases.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1073" target="_blank">00:17:53.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1074" target="_blank">00:17:54.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Like yes, I don't know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1075" target="_blank">00:17:55.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1076" target="_blank">00:17:56.580</a></span> | <span class="t">In this particular example, I'm curious on whether you see any bias with the score.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1082" target="_blank">00:18:02.580</a></span> | <span class="t">In other words, if you were to look at the distribution of scores.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1084" target="_blank">00:18:04.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1085" target="_blank">00:18:05.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Would it be a normal distribution?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1086" target="_blank">00:18:06.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1087" target="_blank">00:18:07.580</a></span> | <span class="t">This is an interesting question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1088" target="_blank">00:18:08.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Like this is one question that we ask in our research settings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1092" target="_blank">00:18:12.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Like one thing that we are trying to understand, like we have a research group called societal impacts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1098" target="_blank">00:18:18.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And one thing that we are trying to understand now is like when you summarize like news articles and you try to evaluate like the bias was kind of the distribution.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1111" target="_blank">00:18:31.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And I feel like this is like research active, like, yeah, I think it depends on the task.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1115" target="_blank">00:18:35.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, really I did not test on this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1118" target="_blank">00:18:38.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Literally it was yesterday, uh, prompting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1125" target="_blank">00:18:45.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1126" target="_blank">00:18:46.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, the second task.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1129" target="_blank">00:18:49.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so Claude is known for a hundred K context, uh, size, which is the entire book of the great Gatsby can like put into the context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1139" target="_blank">00:18:59.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can like ask the model, uh, summarize the book or like, uh, ask some tasks based on the huge context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1146" target="_blank">00:19:06.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is like basically time test compute, um, thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1153" target="_blank">00:19:13.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it was long context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1156" target="_blank">00:19:16.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, let me see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1159" target="_blank">00:19:19.580</a></span> | <span class="t">The way you can use long context can be in different ways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1164" target="_blank">00:19:24.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Like one way is like you put multiple documents and try to summarize or like retrieve information based on the documents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1171" target="_blank">00:19:31.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Another way to use long context is to have a bunch, a huge few shot prompt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1177" target="_blank">00:19:37.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And so as you know, like chain of thought, um, technique relies on the stated reasoning, faithfully reflecting the models, actual reasoning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1190" target="_blank">00:19:50.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And in one of the recent papers, we found that it's not super, like, it's not always the case.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1195" target="_blank">00:19:55.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So doesn't, so basically what it means is that like, if you ask the model, do a chain of thought, it might not necessarily attend to, you know, chain of thought, uh, to produce the final answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1214" target="_blank">00:20:14.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, it might just like ignore it or like, uh, not take any account.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1218" target="_blank">00:20:18.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's not, we, we call it like unfaithful basically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1221" target="_blank">00:20:21.580</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not super faithful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1223" target="_blank">00:20:23.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And so if you propose in this paper, um, like decomposition based methods can actually achieve like strong performance on specifically question answering tasks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1236" target="_blank">00:20:36.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes approaching that of chain of thought performance while improving the faithfulness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1241" target="_blank">00:20:41.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you guys have any questions?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1245" target="_blank">00:20:45.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1247" target="_blank">00:20:47.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, faithfulness is, um, yes, to your prompt.</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1261" target="_blank">00:21:01.580</a></span> | <span class="t">What's decomposition?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1262" target="_blank">00:21:02.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1263" target="_blank">00:21:03.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, let me explain what decomposition is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1265" target="_blank">00:21:05.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So here's the graph from the paper.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1268" target="_blank">00:21:08.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, we have like three methods.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1271" target="_blank">00:21:11.580</a></span> | <span class="t">First is a chain of thought method, which is like, uh, here's the question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1276" target="_blank">00:21:16.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Could, could we do fit in a kangaroo pouch?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1279" target="_blank">00:21:19.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, there are two choices.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1280" target="_blank">00:21:20.580</a></span> | <span class="t">A yes, B no.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1282" target="_blank">00:21:22.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Chain of thought prompt saying like, let's think step by step.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1288" target="_blank">00:21:28.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, step by step gives the reasoning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1291" target="_blank">00:21:31.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, the human asked the follow up questions based on the above.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1295" target="_blank">00:21:35.580</a></span> | <span class="t">What is the single most likely answer choice?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1298" target="_blank">00:21:38.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, and the model says the correct answer choices is B, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1303" target="_blank">00:21:43.580</a></span> | <span class="t">The chain of thought decomposition is when you decompose a question, when you can ask the model to decompose a question into like multiple sub questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1313" target="_blank">00:21:53.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So that each sub question are kind of independent from each other because in chain of thought, like you have one, two, three, you know, like they kind of like can influence each other, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1324" target="_blank">00:22:04.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Like in decomposition, you kind of like, um, you, you decompose and you like put each sub question in the independent context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1334" target="_blank">00:22:14.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So in a way it kind of like reduces the bias.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1337" target="_blank">00:22:17.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and so in this, um, let's, let's see here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1343" target="_blank">00:22:23.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Is it like a sub question one, uh, what type of animal is Scooby-Doo?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1347" target="_blank">00:22:27.580</a></span> | <span class="t">The answer from the model, Scooby-Doo is a fictional character.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1351" target="_blank">00:22:31.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Another sub question for, uh, for the assistant for Claude, how big is an average kangaroo pouch?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1357" target="_blank">00:22:37.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And you would, and what you can see is that like each sub question is kind of like self-contained.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1362" target="_blank">00:22:42.580</a></span> | <span class="t">It's very atomic self-contained question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1365" target="_blank">00:22:45.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and so you have like multiple sub questions like this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1369" target="_blank">00:22:49.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And then what you do is you recompose.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1372" target="_blank">00:22:52.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So like you like put sub question, answer, sub question, answer, sub question, answer into like one context and ask the model based on the above, what is the single most likely answer choice?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1383" target="_blank">00:23:03.580</a></span> | <span class="t">The correct answer choice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1384" target="_blank">00:23:04.580</a></span> | <span class="t">The correct answer choice is B.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1385" target="_blank">00:23:05.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1386" target="_blank">00:23:06.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, like in the system prompt or whatever the user's prompt is, like we mentioned less things step-by-step.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1390" target="_blank">00:23:10.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, what do you do for the decomposition?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1391" target="_blank">00:23:11.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Is there like a similar, you know, input to the model to make it decompose into multiple questions?</span></div><div class="c"><span

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1411" target="_blank">00:23:31.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, but, uh, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1432" target="_blank">00:23:52.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, very hard to see, but I'll share the slides.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1438" target="_blank">00:23:58.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, let's, um, I, I'm, I'm gonna give you like legal context, like legal question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1445" target="_blank">00:24:05.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's say you have a question on like, a legal question and you ask us like which of the following is the most persuasive argument that a person is liable to the creditor under the terms of the agreement and here's the context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1459" target="_blank">00:24:19.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's the question basically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1461" target="_blank">00:24:21.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you have like choices for the model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1465" target="_blank">00:24:25.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is like multiple choice question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1468" target="_blank">00:24:28.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And before that you have like a huge few shot prompt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1471" target="_blank">00:24:31.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and basically here to answer your question, like it says, I'm going to give you a question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1479" target="_blank">00:24:39.580</a></span> | <span class="t">I want you to compose into a series of sub questions.</span></div><div

really important, blah, blah, blah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1492" target="_blank">00:24:52.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, make sure not to decompose more than necessary.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1497" target="_blank">00:24:57.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, be concise, blah, blah, blah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1501" target="_blank">00:25:01.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Please put each sub question in like this tags, but include the numbers corresponding to each tag.</span></div><div class="c"><span

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1511" target="_blank">00:25:11.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, you have a question.</span></div><div

questions for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1522" target="_blank">00:25:22.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And then what you do is that you try to answer the first sub question and you give it to the model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1528" target="_blank">00:25:28.580</a></span> | <span class="t">You try to answer the second sub question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1529" target="_blank">00:25:29.580</a></span> | <span class="t">You give it to the model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1530" target="_blank">00:25:30.580</a></span> | <span class="t">The third sub question you give to the model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1532" target="_blank">00:25:32.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And then later you say like based on everything above, like you give all the context, um, answer me the question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1543" target="_blank">00:25:43.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, the correct answer C.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1545" target="_blank">00:25:45.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1546" target="_blank">00:25:46.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this is like very similar in the legal context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1553" target="_blank">00:25:53.580</a></span> | <span class="t">You have sub questions like what is consideration of contract law, blah, blah, blah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1558" target="_blank">00:25:58.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And you have, you can have like another model to like sample here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1561" target="_blank">00:26:01.580</a></span> | <span class="t">You can have like another model to answer this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1563" target="_blank">00:26:03.580</a></span> | <span class="t">It doesn't necessarily should be like one model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1566" target="_blank">00:26:06.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and then there's like another sub question and here's the answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1574" target="_blank">00:26:14.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1575" target="_blank">00:26:15.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you guys have any questions?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1578" target="_blank">00:26:18.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, the second thing that I want to talk about is how to use claw to do evaluations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1592" target="_blank">00:26:32.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Like evaluating like clawed on like long context ability.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1598" target="_blank">00:26:38.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, let's say you have a lot of like documents and you want to understand how good clawed is answering questions based on the document.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1610" target="_blank">00:26:50.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Or is it, is it able to answer like the questions, not just like from its protein knowledge, but like based on the document itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1621" target="_blank">00:27:01.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and so, um, I'm going to give you an example that we did at Anthropic, um, multiple choice QA, um, evaluation design.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1632" target="_blank">00:27:12.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So our goal was to, with this experience to evaluate techniques to maximize clawed chance to correctly recalling a specific piece of information from a long document.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1643" target="_blank">00:27:23.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the document that we chose was the government document that contains like a bunch of like meeting transcripts, different departments,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1651" target="_blank">00:27:31.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And you also chose the one that was like, uh, from this year, July 13th, uh, which is like way after clots, um, training data cut off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1663" target="_blank">00:27:43.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So that you don't like, um, you have the document that does not have in the preteen knowledge or something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1671" target="_blank">00:27:51.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what you're trying to do is like, now you want to use clawed to generate question answers pairs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1681" target="_blank">00:28:01.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, you, in a way like you create like data, data set based, you use language models to create like data sets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1691" target="_blank">00:28:11.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the way you do that is that you split the document into sections and use clawed to generate like five multiple choice questions for each section.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1700" target="_blank">00:28:20.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Each was three wrong answers and one right answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1703" target="_blank">00:28:23.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you do that, you then reassemble like randomized sets of those sections into like long documents that you could pass them to clawed and test its recall, uh, of their contents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1717" target="_blank">00:28:37.580</a></span> | <span class="t">This is very matter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1719" target="_blank">00:28:39.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Let me know if you have questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1721" target="_blank">00:28:41.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1722" target="_blank">00:28:42.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so here's a prompt to generate multiple choice questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1730" target="_blank">00:28:50.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, I asked, please write five actual questions for those, um, some guidelines at the end.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1740" target="_blank">00:29:00.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and basically we test different strategies, prompting strategies, just asking clawed, give clawed two fixed examples of correctly answered general knowledge and, um, that are unrelated to the government document.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1757" target="_blank">00:29:17.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, providing two examples and providing five examples of correctly answered questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1764" target="_blank">00:29:24.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And we tested the strategies, uh, on different settings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1769" target="_blank">00:29:29.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Like one is containing the answer positioned at the beginning, the end or the middle and the input.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1776" target="_blank">00:29:36.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And we tested with like 70K and 95K token documents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1781" target="_blank">00:29:41.580</a></span> | <span class="t">You can look at the prompts and more specific how we did this in our blog post.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1791" target="_blank">00:29:51.580</a></span> | <span class="t">But basically the results is this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1794" target="_blank">00:29:54.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, here we see that, um, yeah, the metric was, um, to, let's see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1808" target="_blank">00:30:08.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So, let's see, like basically how many, how many times like clawed has correctly answered the question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1824" target="_blank">00:30:24.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1826" target="_blank">00:30:26.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, yeah, sorry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1831" target="_blank">00:30:31.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, basically what we find is that like for document Q and A, asking the question at the end of the prompt performs a lot better than asking at the beginning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1841" target="_blank">00:30:41.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can see it here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1842" target="_blank">00:30:42.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, pulling relevant quotes into like critique or like thoughts tags is helpful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1850" target="_blank">00:30:50.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, it's like the small cost to latency, but improves accuracy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1857" target="_blank">00:30:57.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, and we tested on like both clawed and clawed instant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1861" target="_blank">00:31:01.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and it seems like you can boost way better performance from like clawed instant, um, than clawed too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1872" target="_blank">00:31:12.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, basically the idea is that like, if you want to use long doc Q and A, put the instructions at the end of your prompt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1884" target="_blank">00:31:24.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1885" target="_blank">00:31:25.580</a></span> | <span class="t">That's like the results of this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1886" target="_blank">00:31:26.580</a></span> | <span class="t">What was the, I didn't catch, what was the scratch pad in the.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1891" target="_blank">00:31:31.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, oh yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1892" target="_blank">00:31:32.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Like you just asked the model to like put thoughts in like thoughts tags before answering the question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1898" target="_blank">00:31:38.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So it has like more reasoning based.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1900" target="_blank">00:31:40.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1901" target="_blank">00:31:41.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Can you go to the table again?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1902" target="_blank">00:31:42.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Sorry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1903" target="_blank">00:31:43.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1904" target="_blank">00:31:44.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Sorry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1905" target="_blank">00:31:45.580</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1916" target="_blank">00:31:56.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1917" target="_blank">00:31:57.580</a></span> | <span class="t">But like the outcome was basically putting it at the end matters more than all the other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1922" target="_blank">00:32:02.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1923" target="_blank">00:32:03.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Optimizing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1924" target="_blank">00:32:04.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1925" target="_blank">00:32:05.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1926" target="_blank">00:32:06.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1927" target="_blank">00:32:07.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1928" target="_blank">00:32:08.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Anyway, this is like an example to show like how to use cloud to generate a data set that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1938" target="_blank">00:32:18.580</a></span> | <span class="t">can like evaluate and like you can use it for like evaluation basically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1942" target="_blank">00:32:22.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1943" target="_blank">00:32:23.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So this has to do with putting your instruction at the end of the prompt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1948" target="_blank">00:32:28.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, first of the theories on like why, why specifically the instructions should be at the end.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1952" target="_blank">00:32:32.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And are there any things like, do we have any understanding of like, are there certain things at the beginning of the prompt that still might be weighted?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1965" target="_blank">00:32:45.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Or is it like this sliding scale that like the further in the beginning of the prompt, like the less attention it gets?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1971" target="_blank">00:32:51.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1972" target="_blank">00:32:52.580</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that's basically the hypothesis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1974" target="_blank">00:32:54.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1975" target="_blank">00:32:55.580</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like the, you know, it's like the distance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1978" target="_blank">00:32:58.580</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like the model attends more to the end of the prompt, uh, than the beginning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1983" target="_blank">00:33:03.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1984" target="_blank">00:33:04.580</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not like a u or a physics example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1985" target="_blank">00:33:05.580</a></span> | <span class="t">I think there was a paper saying like it just forgets in the middle or something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1988" target="_blank">00:33:08.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1989" target="_blank">00:33:09.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1990" target="_blank">00:33:10.580</a></span> | <span class="t">I think this is the problem with like long context that you're trying to fix or something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1994" target="_blank">00:33:14.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=1995" target="_blank">00:33:15.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So to follow on that question, you're saying that there was a paper that said that it remembers the beginning and then and kind of forget in the middle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2004" target="_blank">00:33:24.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2005" target="_blank">00:33:25.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So what you're saying is for plot to it seems to do best if you give it at the end.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2009" target="_blank">00:33:29.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2010" target="_blank">00:33:30.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So that paper doesn't apply to plot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2012" target="_blank">00:33:32.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, I did not read that paper.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2016" target="_blank">00:33:36.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2017" target="_blank">00:33:37.580</a></span> | <span class="t">No, I'm just curious.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2018" target="_blank">00:33:38.580</a></span> | <span class="t">What you're saying is you're finding it at least for plot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2021" target="_blank">00:33:41.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2022" target="_blank">00:33:42.580</a></span> | <span class="t">The end part gets more attention.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2024" target="_blank">00:33:44.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2025" target="_blank">00:33:45.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2026" target="_blank">00:33:46.580</a></span> | <span class="t">For like a specific task is like a long context, uh, Q and A for like long documents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2030" target="_blank">00:33:50.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2031" target="_blank">00:33:51.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, yeah, we have not tested on other tasks to my knowledge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2037" target="_blank">00:33:57.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so the prompts you showed were using regular pros and then the XML tags.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2045" target="_blank">00:34:05.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, I think that's also what's in the entropic docs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2049" target="_blank">00:34:09.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Have you guys ever done experiments on like that kind of format versus Markdown versus everything is in XML?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2057" target="_blank">00:34:17.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you have any thoughts on that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2059" target="_blank">00:34:19.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2060" target="_blank">00:34:20.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So, um, in general, I think, I think it's because Markdown was kind of like, there's not that much of like, I don't know, it's like best in XML tags.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2078" target="_blank">00:34:38.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Like I'm, I'm thinking the, I've like tried to like, you know, use like Jason, or like, uh, use Markdown, but sometimes it's like, you know, it's not as good as like XML.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2091" target="_blank">00:34:51.580</a></span> | <span class="t">With

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2101" target="_blank">00:35:01.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, let's go to another task.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2104" target="_blank">00:35:04.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, let's go to another task, um, which is like, you can use language models to like auto label basically anything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2115" target="_blank">00:35:15.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so one of the examples that we did last year, um, we asked Lot to categorize the labels for the clusters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2126" target="_blank">00:35:26.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, um, this was for the paper, but the approach was very simple.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2134" target="_blank">00:35:34.580</a></span> | <span class="t">We have a bunch of like, you know, texts and we embed them in you map.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2139" target="_blank">00:35:39.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and we do like K and N clustering and for each cluster, sorry, K means clustering and for each cluster select like, for each cluster aggregate all the, you know, little like statements or claims.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2161" target="_blank">00:36:01.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and we ask the model to come up with the category for this cluster.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2168" target="_blank">00:36:08.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's the approach.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2170" target="_blank">00:36:10.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can look at the other labels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2176" target="_blank">00:36:16.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, labels here are not super good because we used cloud 1.3 at that time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2181" target="_blank">00:36:21.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Cloud 2 is supposed to be like way better at this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2184" target="_blank">00:36:24.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, but this is like, you know, cache.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2186" target="_blank">00:36:26.580</a></span> | <span class="t">It was like last year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2187" target="_blank">00:36:27.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, where's my slides?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2193" target="_blank">00:36:33.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And so one thing that you can do with this kind of task, we call it self consistency.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2207" target="_blank">00:36:47.580</a></span> | <span class="t">You can generate N samples for the question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2211" target="_blank">00:36:51.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so let's say you have a question like, how do you label this cluster?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2218" target="_blank">00:36:58.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And you generate independently and times and you can ask just like come up with like one category.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2225" target="_blank">00:37:05.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, well, this method is mostly useful for like quantitative.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2231" target="_blank">00:37:11.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Like if you have like a math question and you sample like different, like sample multiple times and come up with the answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2238" target="_blank">00:37:18.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, like the most common answer is, uh, the one that you select with the final answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2245" target="_blank">00:37:25.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is called the majority of vote.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2248" target="_blank">00:37:28.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Another technique that you can use is like, um, have like two generated samples and ask another model to evaluate whether those samples are consistent or not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2259" target="_blank">00:37:39.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And if the samples are consistent, well, you gain more confidence that this is correct.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2263" target="_blank">00:37:43.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2264" target="_blank">00:37:44.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And if it's not consistent, you just like the select.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2269" target="_blank">00:37:49.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, another thing that you want to do with cloud is, uh, if you, if cloud is kind of like misses the nuance, especially for like categorizing a lot of labels and you have like a lot of like categorizations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2285" target="_blank">00:38:05.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, you can add contrasting conceptual distinctions in your instruction and you can do it in multiple ways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2296" target="_blank">00:38:16.580</a></span> | <span class="t">One way to do this, like you provide bad example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2298" target="_blank">00:38:18.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's say like, here's a very bad category and you should never come up with it because this is like too narrow or like too general.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2305" target="_blank">00:38:25.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is not what I want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2306" target="_blank">00:38:26.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, like give like contrastive like examples and vary the context, use examples in different contexts and settings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2315" target="_blank">00:38:35.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, not just like, just like have like more diversity, like diversity is like, um, and the more diverse, like future prompts examples, the better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2325" target="_blank">00:38:45.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Use analogies and metaphors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2328" target="_blank">00:38:48.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, if the concept is like too hard to understand for the model, try to like decompose and like bring analogy, um, point out like common misconceptions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2339" target="_blank">00:38:59.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, especially for like categorizing, like, let's say what is false presupposition, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2349" target="_blank">00:39:09.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, uh, point out the common misconception and like clarify like why this is like incorrect, like provide examples that explicitly show why common misconception is wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2362" target="_blank">00:39:22.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, yes, do you guys have any questions?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2368" target="_blank">00:39:28.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2369" target="_blank">00:39:29.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, I can not speak here, but, um, yeah, like come up with a category.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2397" target="_blank">00:39:57.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, um, yeah, come up with a category or like classify, uh, like label that cluster basically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2405" target="_blank">00:40:05.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so here's like very basic like tips and strategies with cloud API.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2413" target="_blank">00:40:13.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, number one is formatting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2416" target="_blank">00:40:16.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, like human assistant is like what cloud loves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2421" target="_blank">00:40:21.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you miss this, you miss it, like you'll get like very, very terrible results.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2425" target="_blank">00:40:25.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, new line, new line, human, new line, new line assistant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2430" target="_blank">00:40:30.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2431" target="_blank">00:40:31.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, you can also put words in cloud's mouth to like, kind of like say like, do you understand it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2442" target="_blank">00:40:42.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can like put in the, um, cloud's mouth?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2446" target="_blank">00:40:46.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2448" target="_blank">00:40:48.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And a way to like, you know, put, put the model into these modes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2452" target="_blank">00:40:52.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Have cloud repeat instructions back.</span></div><div

assistant, yes, I understand instructions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2467" target="_blank">00:41:07.580</a></span> | <span

to reduce hallucinations, like let cloud hedge and like say like, I don't know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2479" target="_blank">00:41:19.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Or like, uh, I don't have enough information or like context to answer the question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2491" target="_blank">00:41:31.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, if you have like generate direct quotes, if you have like a document or like, um, a long document in the context, um, make cloud to say, find appropriate quotes, but also say like, um, if there are no quotes in this document that seems relevant to this question, please just say, I don't find any relevant quotes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2517" target="_blank">00:41:57.580</a></span> | <span

is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2653" target="_blank">00:44:13.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and I think the answers are pretty clear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2656" target="_blank">00:44:16.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Like prompting will stay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2658" target="_blank">00:44:18.580</a></span> | <span class="t">We'll just ask like more

target="_blank">00:44:22.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, prompting engineering is a, we will like, we're moving towards the world where we'll have like more and more synthetic data generation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2672" target="_blank">00:44:32.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I'm pretty

target="_blank">00:44:39.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, you can also use language models to write like evaluations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2685" target="_blank">00:44:45.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so you use prompting to do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2689" target="_blank">00:44:49.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, reinforcement learning from AI feedback, um, is an alternative to like reinforcement human, from human feedback, which is like a little more scalable, but basically you ask the model to revise its own responses in the process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2706" target="_blank">00:45:06.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So you give the model, you like ask the model to like self reflect or like self revise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2712" target="_blank">00:45:12.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and so you use prompting in that process to do this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2716" target="_blank">00:45:16.580</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2725" target="_blank">00:45:25.580</a></span> | <span class="t">I feel like, um, things that we did in cloud products, such as like originating titles, like this things was never like done before, like before like large language models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2739" target="_blank">00:45:39.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you can like create delightful mini UX experiences, uh, such as like that using just prompting or something and you can like have personalization.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2750" target="_blank">00:45:50.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, maybe you can

Sometimes we just like have to look manually qualitatively, uh, at outputs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2949" target="_blank">00:49:09.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, sometimes you, let's say, um, you want to evaluate, you know, how much does the model refuses and if it refuses in a relevant context or not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2963" target="_blank">00:49:23.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, uh, you, uh, you use, you know, generated answers and you categorize infusals in different categories.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2972" target="_blank">00:49:32.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And use the model to categorize that. And so you just like see the rate. Um, yeah, I can think of that example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2980" target="_blank">00:49:40.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. It depends on the task. Some tasks are like, you know, um, for like hallucinations,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2988" target="_blank">00:49:48.580</a></span> | <span class="t">you actually have to like look yourself or something. Yeah. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=2993" target="_blank">00:49:53.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, it was open AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=3020" target="_blank">00:50:20.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think, uh, um, I won't say too much about this, but I actually have not like excessively used function calling from open AI like other models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=3045" target="_blank">00:50:45.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, yeah. Right. Cool. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=3053" target="_blank">00:50:53.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=3054" target="_blank">00:50:54.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So you mentioned something about, you know, using, uh, LF to generate titles for customers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=3059" target="_blank">00:50:59.580</a></span> | <span class="t">How do you actually try to evaluate if the titles are relevant and actually consistent beyond human care?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=3068" target="_blank">00:51:08.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, yeah, I think, uh, one, uh, actually this is an interesting question. Like I worked on the outer generating titles for cloud AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=3074" target="_blank">00:51:14.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And, um, one thing that I asked cloud is to be like an editor, like have an editorial taste.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=3083" target="_blank">00:51:23.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And what we did is actually we took previous titles and we put it in the context to generate a new title.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=3093" target="_blank">00:51:33.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And so in a way it's like a little bit more consistent to, um, what the style of the user is. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=3100" target="_blank">00:51:40.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, yeah, I'm not sure if I can share that. Oh yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=3113" target="_blank">00:51:53.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, yeah, we, we use this in production. I can like show you like cloud AI interface.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=3117" target="_blank">00:51:57.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And, uh, one thing that we changed recently is that like, if you have like pretty like short, like, um, you know, sometimes you don't have, you don't need like LLM to come up with a title.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=3131" target="_blank">00:52:11.580</a></span> | <span class="t">You just take, if the prompt is like very short, you just like, um, use the, like the first like words.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=3138" target="_blank">00:52:18.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, but here, yeah, like, I don't know. Um, let's see Hayes introduction, but then like recommend some books.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=3151" target="_blank">00:52:31.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, yeah, I don't know. Uh, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=3159" target="_blank">00:52:39.580</a></span> | <span class="t">I have a quick question. Did you cover the difference between quality products then?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=3164" target="_blank">00:52:44.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, no, but I can tell. Uh, so Claude.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=3170" target="_blank">00:52:50.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's look at the, is there some dogs on this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=3182" target="_blank">00:53:02.580</a></span> | <span class="t">When did we announce? Uh, or nine, August 9th.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=3191" target="_blank">00:53:11.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, basically Claude 2 is a larger model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=3195" target="_blank">00:53:15.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, is a little bit smarter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=3197" target="_blank">00:53:17.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Is like smarter than Claude instant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=3200" target="_blank">00:53:20.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Claude instant is way cheaper and way faster.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=3203" target="_blank">00:53:23.580</a></span> | <span class="t">But Claude instant is better than Claude instant one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=3208" target="_blank">00:53:28.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, in a, like more like reasoning based task.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=3211" target="_blank">00:53:31.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's way better at math.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=3213" target="_blank">00:53:33.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, it's way better at code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=3216" target="_blank">00:53:36.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, other benchmarks are like pretty similar, but I think we specifically trained Claude instant to be good at like math and code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=3225" target="_blank">00:53:45.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and it's a way better at like red teaming, um, like automated red teaming evaluation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=3231" target="_blank">00:53:51.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's more robust to like jail breaks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=3234" target="_blank">00:53:54.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=3239" target="_blank">00:53:59.580</a></span> | <span class="t">I really liked this model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=3241" target="_blank">00:54:01.580</a></span> | <span class="t">You guys should use it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=3242" target="_blank">00:54:02.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=3247" target="_blank">00:54:07.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So when you talk about training, like when you train this client, was that fine tuning?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=3251" target="_blank">00:54:11.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Or was that something different?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=3253" target="_blank">00:54:13.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=3254" target="_blank">00:54:14.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Fine tuning.</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=3256" target="_blank">00:54:16.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Last question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=3257" target="_blank">00:54:17.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Can you say more about red teaming?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=3260" target="_blank">00:54:20.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Like what is red teaming?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=3261" target="_blank">00:54:21.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=3263" target="_blank">00:54:23.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Red teaming is an interesting concept.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=3265" target="_blank">00:54:25.580</a></span> | <span class="t">It's, um, basically you, like the models are pretty like, uh, vulnerable to like certain like jail breaks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=3275" target="_blank">00:54:35.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so sometimes let's say like a very simple example, like can the model give you instructions how to build a bomb?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=3282" target="_blank">00:54:42.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we, we consider it as a jail break.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=3285" target="_blank">00:54:45.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the goal is to like, uh, in that cases, like the model should like refuse or do not like provide any additional information in case of like, um, unsafe like prompts or something like this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=3300" target="_blank">00:55:00.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this is like the internal evaluation that we have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=3303" target="_blank">00:55:03.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, you can read in the model card that we have, we launched in cloud two, how we specifically do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d60zVdcCV4&t=3310" target="_blank">00:55:10.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, but it's basically the amount of like, um, how robust the model is to like those jail breaks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
