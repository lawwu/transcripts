Let's keep going. This is a video where I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">started watching and thought oh wow this is kind of insane. So this is AI generated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean it's insane. So there was the odd thing that was weird but it's just incredible how good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">like the background is perfect. It doesn't seem to, there's nothing weird going on. The mood,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">like the person is actually moving through the scene which you don't usually get with AI generated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">videos. It's usually kind of like they're moving slightly and you know the background is maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.280</a></span> | <span class="t">moving a little bit but this is like insane. The amount of detail and the amount of movement is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">just, I don't even know. I noticed earlier that the legs get a little weird around,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=155" target="_blank">00:02:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">it's kind of like the hands to disable diffusion. Now it's legs. Around here the leg kind of swaps,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">it's super weird. Oh look at that, her left leg became her right leg which is interesting. It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">hard to even notice that but this is just insane. I even, like you look at here and you look at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.240</a></span> | <span class="t">jacket and it has these, you know, these four buttons here. You go ahead, I'm just trying to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.640</a></span> | <span class="t">find anything that's kind of odd but even here it's like the same four buttons, same jacket,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe oh this is kind of long and big here. Okay so this grew over the video but like, gosh I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">really like pointing out these very minor little things. It's just insane. Then you look at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">prompt and it's not, you know, it's like it's a relative, it's a paragraph. I mean it's nothing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">crazy and that paragraph of text produced this. Gosh I'm gonna have so much good suck video for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">my videos now. This one I saw briefly, I thought this was less impressive but I mean it's so good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And then this one, guy with a woolly, it's just like a, I don't even know, it's a bit weird and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of all over the place but it's really pretty cool. I mean look at the detail on the guy and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.600</a></span> | <span class="t">then this as well, like it just looks real, no? Am I, like it just looks real. The guy looks real,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">like there's nothing here that doesn't look legit. Photorealistic video to pirate ships,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">ah, it's a sail inside a cup of coffee.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">How good is that? Like looking at this, would I think it is, like the book is being weird and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of going a little crazy but would I, if this wasn't on OpenAI's website, would I have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">looked at this and thought this is an AI video? I don't, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't. Okay so then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Sora is becoming available to red teamers, so that it's still very, like it isn't released yet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">We're also granting access to a number of visual artists, designers and filmmakers to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">gain feedback on how to advance the model to be most helpful for creative professionals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.440</a></span> | <span class="t">How insane, look at this. So this, historical footage of California during the gold rush,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean the prompt is tiny but I would never, if you'd have shown me this two days, a day ago,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I would be like oh look at this cool, like how did they film this?

Things like the human eye are, because we're, I think biologically we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">so able to, like we know what an eye looks like more than anything else, right? We can read an eye</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and understand it so well and the fact that I look at this and I don't think I can tell that it's not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=353" target="_blank">00:05:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">real. And it's probably the feature that I as a human would, should be able to distinguish from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.560</a></span> | <span class="t">reality the easiest of anything. That should be like the hardest thing to convince me. Maybe it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">moves a bit weirdly, but the eyeball I mean, but really, I mean it's insane. I mean this is going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">to be like the new AI generated photos where you, after a little while, this is interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So like the people here are tiny and then all of a sudden these people are huge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh wow, this is, I mean it's not supposed to be like that of course, but it's interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, this like creating multiple shots within a single generated video that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=409" target="_blank">00:06:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">that you know, the characters remain the same.

Yeah, that's interesting. So the perspective seems to mess up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=430" target="_blank">00:07:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">more, more often. That's like a strange thing that it has going on here. Also in the earlier</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=437" target="_blank">00:07:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">video in Lagos in Nigeria, the perspectives were kind of messed up.

How cool is that? It looks like a film. There's some weird stuff going on here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=451" target="_blank">00:07:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I feel.

For example, a person might</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=470" target="_blank">00:07:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">take a bite out of a cookie, but afterward the cookie might not have a bite mark. The model may</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=476" target="_blank">00:07:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">also confuse spatial details of a prompt.

How, how insane.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=535" target="_blank">00:08:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So, and then the guy's hands as well, like messed up. But this is, I mean, despite how weird it is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=546" target="_blank">00:09:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it looks so, it feels like I'm watching a, I don't know, like a dream or something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=553" target="_blank">00:09:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the actual people themselves, they're pretty impressive. And this is the first version,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=561" target="_blank">00:09:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">this is just insane. Okay, so that working red team is so people that will basically stress test</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=568" target="_blank">00:09:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the model, make sure it's not going to do anything weird, and they'll probably go over the top with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=574" target="_blank">00:09:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it, but what can you do? Oh, I imagine how good all the UFO videos will be now. That's exciting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=582" target="_blank">00:09:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, it's going to be so difficult to know what's real anymore. All right,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=588" target="_blank">00:09:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">so Sora is a diffusion model. It generates videos. We're starting off with one that looks like static</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=593" target="_blank">00:09:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">noise. Oh wow, it does the same. How? So it starts with static noise and obviously removes the noise</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=600" target="_blank">00:10:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">over many steps. I think it's the same as video stable diffusion. Then, okay, transformer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=608" target="_blank">00:10:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">architecture. I think they all, I mean, I assume the other ones did that as well with the way that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=614" target="_blank">00:10:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">they encode the text. They represent videos and images collection, smaller units called patches.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=620" target="_blank">00:10:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, that's, I think, similar to before. It uses the recaptioning technique from Dali 3,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=628" target="_blank">00:10:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">which involves generating highly scripted captions for the visual training data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=633" target="_blank">00:10:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">As a result, the model is able to follow the user's text instructions and generate a video</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=636" target="_blank">00:10:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">more faithfully. Sora says foundation for models which can understand and simulate the real world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=642" target="_blank">00:10:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, it's not bad. How insane is that? Okay. I don't, yeah, I don't have much more to say.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=658" target="_blank">00:10:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">That's pretty impressive. It seems like it's probably going to be a while before we can do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=664" target="_blank">00:11:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">anything with it. I'm very curious to see where the other open source video generation models end</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=671" target="_blank">00:11:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">up. They, I mean, they've, they've seemed like the ones that are ahead for a long time. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=677" target="_blank">00:11:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">obviously OpenAI just, they, they share this, but this is, this is really very, very interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=685" target="_blank">00:11:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, that's all I have. So thank you. Thank you for watching and see you later. Bye.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=703" target="_blank">00:11:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">(gentle music)</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-BuJId6cK4&t=706" target="_blank">00:11:46.340</a></span> | <span class="t">you</span></div></div></body></html>
