And the difference being that a soft inquiry is one that can check your credit, but not make a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=345" target="_blank">00:05:45.820</a></span> | <span class="t">lending decision. So a soft inquiry actually has no impact on your score, and you might have tons of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.540</a></span> | <span class="t">They usually come from when you're checking your own credit or a credit reporting tool you're using, or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=357" target="_blank">00:05:57.380</a></span> | <span class="t">some banks use them to give you a pre-approval, so they can look at your credit report, decide if they are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.140</a></span> | <span class="t">going to lend you money. When they come to the point which they will lend you money, or approve you for a credit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=367" target="_blank">00:06:07.860</a></span> | <span class="t">card and actually issue it, they have to issue what's called a hard inquiry, which is officially making a lending</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=373" target="_blank">00:06:13.500</a></span> | <span class="t">decision, and that does stay on your credit report, and that can affect your score, and we'll get to scores in a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=379" target="_blank">00:06:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">little bit. For example, when I went through my credit report, I can see 22 different accounts. Now, the funny</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=385" target="_blank">00:06:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">thing is, of those 22 accounts, three of them don't actually show up on my TransUnion report, two don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=391" target="_blank">00:06:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">show up on Equifax, one doesn't show up on Experian, and they're not all the same. Now, to be fair, that does</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">include closed accounts. So of my active accounts, which is just 12, only one of those accounts doesn't show up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=405" target="_blank">00:06:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">on one report, and it's from a random fintech startup. So for the most part, my active current</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.940</a></span> | <span class="t">accounts are still being reported to all three credit bureaus. Additionally, if I look at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=415" target="_blank">00:06:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">inquiry section, it's also a little off, and I have two recent inquiries from Equifax, six from TransUnion,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=422" target="_blank">00:07:02.060</a></span> | <span class="t">six from Experian, but only two of those total 14 inquiries are actually the same, so it's 12 total</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=429" target="_blank">00:07:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">inquiries. And that's because most of the time someone's looking to make a lending decision. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=434" target="_blank">00:07:14.700</a></span> | <span class="t">when I say lending decision, that could be approve you for a mortgage or an auto loan or approve you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=438" target="_blank">00:07:18.440</a></span> | <span class="t">for a credit card. They're only pulling one report from one agency. And so in occasion, like I mentioned,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=445" target="_blank">00:07:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">two of them, they pulled multiple reports, but that doesn't always happen. Do keep in mind, I am in a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=450" target="_blank">00:07:30.120</a></span> | <span class="t">situation where I don't have any collections or public records or delinquent payments that made it to my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=455" target="_blank">00:07:35.900</a></span> | <span class="t">credit report. So none of that information is there. I don't actually have a lot of info on what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=460" target="_blank">00:07:40.780</a></span> | <span class="t">that looks like because I can't view other people's credit reports, which is a very good thing. I will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=465" target="_blank">00:07:45.400</a></span> | <span class="t">say one thing when it comes to delinquent payments. If you are delinquent by less than 30 days, most of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=470" target="_blank">00:07:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">those issuers aren't going to report that if you correct it before the 30 day mark. So it's not all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=475" target="_blank">00:07:55.420</a></span> | <span class="t">delinquent payments. Finally, there is another notable thing missing, and that is all nine of my business</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=480" target="_blank">00:08:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">credit cards. I'll get to that a little bit later, but most business credit cards don't report on your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=485" target="_blank">00:08:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">credit report, at least not your personal credit report. I also opened a Citibank card at the end</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=490" target="_blank">00:08:10.200</a></span> | <span class="t">of February. That wasn't on my credit report. It hasn't made it there yet. I'm recording this in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=494" target="_blank">00:08:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the middle of March.

Turns out there is actually not an easy defined way that I could say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=506" target="_blank">00:08:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">hey, can you start doing this? I could make the request, but there's no way to require anyone to do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=511" target="_blank">00:08:31.340</a></span> | <span class="t">It's all voluntary. But also, I'm not sure, and I'll get to this later, whether it would be worth</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=516" target="_blank">00:08:36.600</a></span> | <span class="t">adding.

But how do you get your report? Well, it's easy. You can request your credit report from all three bureaus for free by going to annualcreditreport.com. You can also call and I'm sure there's an address you can mail. But doing it online is super easy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=662" target="_blank">00:11:02.200</a></span> | <span class="t">You can request your credit report from all three bureaus for free by going to annualcreditreport.com. You can also call and I'm sure there's an address you can mail. But doing it online is super easy. There are hundreds of other sites out there that will sell you your credit report. As far as I can tell, they are all an absolute waste of money. Because you can get your credit report for free. Additionally, many sites like Credit Karma or maybe your bank or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=692" target="_blank">00:11:32.140</a></span> | <span class="t">credit union will give you your credit report free. But the ones you get from annualcreditreport.com are straight from the credit bureaus. And I found them to be really comprehensive, easy to use. And like I said, free.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=705" target="_blank">00:11:45.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, despite the domain name annual credit report, this is no longer annual. It used to be that you could only get your credit report once a year. During the pandemic, they made some changes. And now all three credit bureaus allow you to get your credit report every single week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=718" target="_blank">00:11:58.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, when you first get your report, I'd encourage you to read it carefully because there might be information on there that you don't recognize. Now, sometimes that might be an old credit card that you forgot about. But other times it could be something that isn't correct. And maybe it's not nefarious. Maybe it's not bad, but it's just inaccurate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=734" target="_blank">00:12:14.860</a></span> | <span class="t">In either case, you'll want to dispute something that you don't recognize. And you can do that by contacting the credit reporting company directly. You could do that by calling them, going to the website. But believe it or not, the gold standard for disputing is to actually send a letter. And the CFPB does have free templates.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=751" target="_blank">00:12:31.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Those disputes must be handled by you, the person impacted. Even some of these fancy credit monitoring services that we'll talk about later can only offer you templates or get on a conference call with you because ultimately you have to be the one that disputes it. So they don't really offer anything that you can't do yourself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=768" target="_blank">00:12:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, filing those disputes can have an immediate impact on your credit score, which is great. So definitely do that. But if there are things that are accurate, but impacting you negatively, maybe you missed a payment many years ago. Reminder, after seven years, those negative items should be removed from your report, but it doesn't always happen. So if you find anything that's over that limit, you can also request that be removed. Now, it doesn't erase it from the world. If you have debt and you owe someone money, a financial institution, for example, and it's been eight years,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=798" target="_blank">00:13:18.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and you remove it from your credit report, you still owe that money. So you can't rely on the fact that you've removed it from your credit report to erase that debt. Additionally, there is a rule recently that the CFPB passed that said medical debt should also be getting removed from your credit report as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=814" target="_blank">00:13:34.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So last on reports, let's talk briefly about credit freezes, fraud alerts, and credit monitoring. Earlier, I explained how a hard inquiry is when a lender is making a decision like approving you for a new loan or a new credit card. Freezing your credit will prevent those inquiries.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=828" target="_blank">00:13:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And thus prevent a lender from opening an account for you. Now, that can be a good thing if someone else is trying to open an account in your name. This will prevent that from happening. Now, it will also prevent you from opening up your own credit card or loan if you don't remember to unfreeze your credit before doing that. You get denied immediately, and you end up having a call to get things reconsidered once you've unfrozen your credit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=851" target="_blank">00:14:11.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I've done this a few times and thought, gosh, why didn't I get approved for this card? Oh, I forgot to unfreeze my credit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=857" target="_blank">00:14:17.080</a></span> | <span class="t">That said, I do think the upside of preventing someone from opening an account in your name is worth the effort, so I do keep my credit frozen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=864" target="_blank">00:14:24.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And you have to do that with all three major credit bureaus one by one, but fortunately, it's easy and you can do it for free on all of their websites.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=872" target="_blank">00:14:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Separate from that, you can also set up what's called a fraud alert. There are three options. There's your initial fraud alert, your extended fraud alert, and an active duty alert.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=880" target="_blank">00:14:40.900</a></span> | <span class="t">They all simply require a business who you're talking to about a loan or a mortgage or a new credit card to contact you directly to verify your identity before opening up any new accounts in your name.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=894" target="_blank">00:14:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So what happens is you'll go online, you'll apply for a credit card or an auto loan, and then you'll get a phone call from that lender trying to make sure that was really you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=902" target="_blank">00:15:02.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So it doesn't prevent them from doing it like a freeze would, but it requires an extra step.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=907" target="_blank">00:15:07.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you want to be able to sign up for a credit card online, get immediately approved, get your virtual card numbers and start spending that card, this could slow that down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=916" target="_blank">00:15:16.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you want to protect your identity, which is what this is for, it can be super helpful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=921" target="_blank">00:15:21.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is primarily for that use case, someone who's worried about their identity getting stolen, and that lasts for one year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=926" target="_blank">00:15:26.820</a></span> | <span class="t">You can extend it for seven years, but only if you're a victim of identity theft, and you actually need to prove and provide some supporting evidence of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=934" target="_blank">00:15:34.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Finally, if you're an active duty military, you can get an active duty fraud alert.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=938" target="_blank">00:15:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It is also only good for one year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=940" target="_blank">00:15:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I tried to research how this was any different than an initial fraud alert because both of them can be renewed, and I couldn't figure it out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=947" target="_blank">00:15:47.300</a></span> | <span class="t">If anyone knows, feel free to let me know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=949" target="_blank">00:15:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But to set up any of these, you actually only need to notify one of the credit bureaus, and they will inform the other two.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=956" target="_blank">00:15:56.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Finally, let's talk credit monitoring.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=958" target="_blank">00:15:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">There are many free services.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=960" target="_blank">00:16:00.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Credit Karma has one, Experian has one, Capital One and Chase have one built into their portals, and they'll continually monitor your credit, often giving you a free credit score, and they can alert you of any changes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=971" target="_blank">00:16:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Those changes can be fraud, errors, or even just the inquiry that someone is checking your credit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=978" target="_blank">00:16:18.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Anytime I apply for a new credit card, I end up getting three or four emails from all these services saying,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=983" target="_blank">00:16:23.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, we saw a new inquiry once that card of cards approved.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=986" target="_blank">00:16:26.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, we saw a new line of credit on your report, that kind of stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=989" target="_blank">00:16:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">There are also a number of paid services, and best I can tell, they market themselves as credit monitoring and credit scores and that kind of stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=998" target="_blank">00:16:38.520</a></span> | <span class="t">But their main benefit over what you can do for yourself for free seems to be much more focused on cybersecurity, providing you with access to VPNs or password managers or insurance or litigation support in case your identity is stolen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1013" target="_blank">00:16:53.160</a></span> | <span class="t">When it comes to actually credit monitoring, I haven't found anything that you can pay for that does more than you can do on your own, other than maybe simplifying the interface, making it faster or easier to get your credit reports.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1027" target="_blank">00:17:07.100</a></span> | <span class="t">But they're not actually doing anything unique, and they can't freeze or unfreeze for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1031" target="_blank">00:17:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">They can't dispute things for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1033" target="_blank">00:17:13.420</a></span> | <span class="t">In my opinion, they are all useless.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1036" target="_blank">00:17:16.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I talked about credit reports and the three major bureaus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1039" target="_blank">00:17:19.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Turns out there are a few other credit bureaus and similar agencies that, as long as we're going down this rabbit hole, I thought I'd touch on before I jump into credit scores.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1049" target="_blank">00:17:29.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So, the first one is Inovus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1050" target="_blank">00:17:30.460</a></span> | <span class="t">They are another credit reporting agency.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1052" target="_blank">00:17:32.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Creditors generally use them for identity verification or fraud prevention.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1056" target="_blank">00:17:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But I ran my Inovus report, and unlike my credit report with 22 items, this only had five items, and it was pretty limited, and there was not that much information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1065" target="_blank">00:17:45.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It was free to check, so I'm glad I got to do it to be able to tell you about it, but it was not that informative.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1071" target="_blank">00:17:51.260</a></span> | <span class="t">The next is Checks with an X.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1073" target="_blank">00:17:53.720</a></span> | <span class="t">They are to bank accounts, as credit bureaus are to credit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1077" target="_blank">00:17:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're opening a new bank account, many banks query Checks' database for red flags in your banking history, and if you have a frozen Checks report, it typically means you will get denied for a new bank account.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1088" target="_blank">00:18:08.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, later I'll talk about a few bank accounts I tried to open in the process of doing this research.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1093" target="_blank">00:18:13.340</a></span> | <span class="t">One of them did not error out when I had my Checks report locked, and one of them said, hey, your Checks report's locked.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1098" target="_blank">00:18:18.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Can you go fix that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1099" target="_blank">00:18:19.880</a></span> | <span class="t">One thing you can do when using Checks is you can opt out of pre-approved offers of credit or insurance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1106" target="_blank">00:18:26.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't like doing that because there are a lot of credit card companies that send elevated offers that I want to be able to get access to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1112" target="_blank">00:18:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">What I did notice looking through my own report, which I did pull, is that it does have some of my personal information, a few inquiries from credit union accounts mostly, and then a ton of requests and inquiries from TransUnion slash Credit Karma.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1128" target="_blank">00:18:48.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think Credit Karma is just querying all the things they have access to query to get as much data about you as they can.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1134" target="_blank">00:18:54.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Kind of makes me wonder if I should delete my Credit Karma account, but I have not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1139" target="_blank">00:18:59.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And they do give you a score.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1140" target="_blank">00:19:00.360</a></span> | <span class="t">The score took me an extra day from the actual disclosure report.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1144" target="_blank">00:19:04.700</a></span> | <span class="t">I got a score of 682.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1146" target="_blank">00:19:06.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I didn't have a lot of context on that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1148" target="_blank">00:19:08.580</a></span> | <span class="t">They said it ranges from 100 to 899 with higher score, meaning lower risk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1153" target="_blank">00:19:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">But I did find a third-party website that said the way they look at these risk levels is depending on how risk-tolerant you are as a bank,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1163" target="_blank">00:19:23.620</a></span> | <span class="t">you want to have something above a 525 to a 580.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1167" target="_blank">00:19:27.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So I guess I am not at any of the cutoffs for a risky bank account user, which hopefully makes sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1174" target="_blank">00:19:34.260</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think I've been doing anything crazy to be put in that camp.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1176" target="_blank">00:19:36.840</a></span> | <span class="t">But this was much more about bank accounts than credit, so I will move on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1180" target="_blank">00:19:40.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Another one is Clarity Services.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1181" target="_blank">00:19:41.960</a></span> | <span class="t">They're kind of more for alternative financial services like payday loans or rent-to-loan agreements.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1187" target="_blank">00:19:47.040</a></span> | <span class="t">You can freeze your report.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1188" target="_blank">00:19:48.500</a></span> | <span class="t">It might prevent someone from taking out one of those things in your name.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1191" target="_blank">00:19:51.540</a></span> | <span class="t">I went in to try to check on my report, and I just got an error that said unable to process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1196" target="_blank">00:19:56.300</a></span> | <span class="t">In order to do that, please send us a written request in the mail with all this information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1201" target="_blank">00:20:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I didn't go down that process at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1202" target="_blank">00:20:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Another one is the National Consumer Telecom and Utilities Exchange.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1206" target="_blank">00:20:06.580</a></span> | <span class="t">They focus on data from telecom, TV, utility accounts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1210" target="_blank">00:20:10.820</a></span> | <span class="t">You could freeze your report if you wanted to prevent someone from opening up a phone plan or a utility account in your name.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1217" target="_blank">00:20:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I got a score on my report of 756.</span></div><div

means.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1223" target="_blank">00:20:23.340</a></span> | <span class="t">The only thing on my report was an old Verizon account that showed as being closed that I paid my bills.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1228" target="_blank">00:20:28.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And then yet again, another 61 inquiries from Credit Karma.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1232" target="_blank">00:20:32.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Two more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1232" target="_blank">00:20:32.900</a></span> | <span class="t">One is the Early Warning Services report.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1235" target="_blank">00:20:35.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Early Warning Services is owned by the seven largest banks in the U.S., and they gather and report information about your banking history.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1242" target="_blank">00:20:42.820</a></span> | <span class="t">The information is pulled by banks when determining if you qualify for a new account.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1247" target="_blank">00:20:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So similar to Chex, except this one was quite a bit more comprehensive and had a lot of information, mostly from those large banks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1256" target="_blank">00:20:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">A lot of the fintech banks I've opened accounts in didn't show up on this report.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1261" target="_blank">00:21:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But I will say that more than 80% of the banks pull your banking reports when they look for new account applications.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1267" target="_blank">00:21:07.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'd say your Chex and your Early Warning Systems reports are really relied upon if you're getting a new bank account.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1273" target="_blank">00:21:13.580</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know what you might find on there, but it's free to pull both of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1277" target="_blank">00:21:17.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's always interesting to do that if you are interested.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1280" target="_blank">00:21:20.940</a></span> | <span class="t">But I didn't really learn anything from doing that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1283" target="_blank">00:21:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Last is

looking up data, they are a big data provider across lots of verticals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1291" target="_blank">00:21:31.620</a></span> | <span class="t">But they do have a lot of information on consumers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1293" target="_blank">00:21:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">They have public records information, insurance claim information, policy data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1298" target="_blank">00:21:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">You can go in and request that,

target="_blank">00:21:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's an option to go freeze it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1306" target="_blank">00:21:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there's an opt-out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1307" target="_blank">00:21:47.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of the interesting things in here was there's opt-in, which I don't know why anyone would click that says allow for the sale of my personal information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1314" target="_blank">00:21:54.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And by the way, these opt-out things, they didn't show me the options until I changed my state to California.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1320" target="_blank">00:22:00.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So I imagine there is some law in California that they're required to make it really easy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1325" target="_blank">00:22:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But I would assume, maybe incorrectly, that anyone can opt-out, but maybe it's not as easy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1331" target="_blank">00:22:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">They had a partial opt-out that said, hey, allow for the sale of my professional information, but don't sell my personal information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1337" target="_blank">00:22:17.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And then they had a full opt-out that says, do not sell or share my personal information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1342" target="_blank">00:22:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And then a sub box that says, limit the use of my sensitive personal information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1347" target="_blank">00:22:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't really know why I would not fully opt-out and limit the use of my personal information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1353" target="_blank">00:22:33.380</a></span> | <span class="t">I care a lot about having my personal information not completely out all over the internet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1357" target="_blank">00:22:37.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So I fully opted out of LexisNexis after I requested my report.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1362" target="_blank">00:22:42.360</a></span> | <span class="t">We'll see what's in there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1363" target="_blank">00:22:43.340</a></span> | <span class="t">This actually reminded me of something I've talked about in the past in episode 78, which is about your personal information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1369" target="_blank">00:22:49.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And so LexisNexis isn't necessarily a data broker, but one of the other places, if you're going through this process of trying to find all of your information, what's being stored and shared about you, is searching yourself online.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1382" target="_blank">00:23:02.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And unfortunately, unless you've already gone through a process I'll describe, you will find your name and address and phone number on lots of different websites.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1391" target="_blank">00:23:11.220</a></span> | <span class="t">There are hundreds of data brokers that are continuously publishing all that information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1395" target="_blank">00:23:15.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And the good news is that you can opt-out of a lot of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1398" target="_blank">00:23:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So most of those websites have a place where you can scroll to the bottom, click opt-out, and submit a form and request they remove your information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1405" target="_blank">00:23:25.060</a></span> | <span class="t">The bad news is that information is constantly popping up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1408" target="_blank">00:23:28.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And so when I first encountered this, I tried to go through this myself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1411" target="_blank">00:23:31.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I probably spent 10 or 12 hours removing data and made it about 10% of the way through a list that I found of all the data brokers and decided that I was going to find a company that does this well and just pay for it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1424" target="_blank">00:23:44.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what started as a search for the best company to do this ended up with a partnership.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1429" target="_blank">00:23:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So full disclosure, the company I use is DeleteMe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1432" target="_blank">00:23:52.060</a></span> | <span class="t">I actually pay them for my entire family to use DeleteMe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1435" target="_blank">00:23:55.420</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't get that for free, but they are a partner of the show.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1438" target="_blank">00:23:58.900</a></span> | <span class="t">They remove your personal information from hundreds of data broker websites.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1442" target="_blank">00:24:02.100</a></span> | <span class="t">They continuously scan to keep that information off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1445" target="_blank">00:24:05.220</a></span> | <span class="t">The reason that's important is, unfortunately, these data brokers have both information on their website, and they typically have a whole bundle of information that they're reselling to other people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1455" target="_blank">00:24:15.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, unfortunately, even though I got all my information removed, DeleteMe keeps scanning and finds it over and over again, which is annoying, but I'm glad that there is a service doing that for me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1465" target="_blank">00:24:25.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Last month, I looked and they reviewed over 16,000 listings, and they removed 80 of them from 53 different data brokers and found 570 pieces of PII.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1476" target="_blank">00:24:36.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's just my personal report.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1477" target="_blank">00:24:37.960</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're interested, go check

<span class="t">All right, let's talk credit scores.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1492" target="_blank">00:24:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Because a little difference in credit score can result in a huge change in the price you pay for different lending situations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1499" target="_blank">00:24:59.640</a></span> | <span class="t">The easiest way to look at the value of this is to look at a mortgage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1503" target="_blank">00:25:03.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, a low credit score might just completely shut you out of a mortgage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1507" target="_blank">00:25:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So, obviously, that's a huge impact.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1509" target="_blank">00:25:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">But even the difference between a high and a low score, and I say low score, I still mean a qualifying score.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1515" target="_blank">00:25:15.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So, if you look at a 30-year mortgage, let's assume a million-dollar home with a 20% down payment, you're having a $800,000 mortgage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1523" target="_blank">00:25:23.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I looked at a table of mortgage rates by FICO score, and they range from 620 to 639 at the bottom, gets a rate of 7.838, and 760 to 850 at the top is a rate of 7.242%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1540" target="_blank">00:25:40.100</a></span> | <span class="t">If you look at the total interest across the life of that loan, you would pay an extra $117,703 of interest just because your credit score was in a lower bracket.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1552" target="_blank">00:25:52.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So, that's a really important thing to keep in mind when we talk credit scores, which we're going to go deep on, is the impact they have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1559" target="_blank">00:25:59.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And on auto loans, it can be even crazier than mortgages.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1563" target="_blank">00:26:03.020</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm looking at a similar chart, and above a 781, you might pay 4.77% for a new car or 7.67% for a used car.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1573" target="_blank">00:26:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">But if your credit score is way down in the 3 to 500 range, the average interest rate for a new car loan is 15.75%, almost four times larger.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1584" target="_blank">00:26:24.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And then on a used car, it goes as high as 21.81%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1587" target="_blank">00:26:27.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And obviously, between 300 to 500 and 781 to 850, it's a sliding scale.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1593" target="_blank">00:26:33.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So, the higher your credit score, the better rates you're going to get both on homes and on autos and in lots of different scenarios.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1602" target="_blank">00:26:42.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So, that said, the upper threshold on this seems to be, depending on the table I'm looking at, somewhere between 760 and 781.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1611" target="_blank">00:26:51.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So, as a general rule of thumb, if your credit's above a 781, I don't think you need to worry about it getting too much higher.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1618" target="_blank">00:26:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But we'll talk about where it could be and what happens in the future.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1622" target="_blank">00:27:02.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Finally, anyone who's bought a home knows that the credit score isn't the only factor in decisions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1627" target="_blank">00:27:07.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So, a lender could also look at your income, your employment history, your debt-to-income ratio, all of your savings, your assets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1634" target="_blank">00:27:14.180</a></span> | <span class="t">It can feel like a little bit of a financial exam when you're buying a home for the first time because you have to provide a lot of information to the lender and the underwriters to make decisions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1642" target="_blank">00:27:22.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So, just keep that in mind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1644" target="_blank">00:27:24.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And last, one other way that your credit score could impact you is when it comes to your employment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1648" target="_blank">00:27:28.560</a></span> | <span class="t">This isn't happening at every single job and every single employer, but some employers do pull background checks, credit scores, and it could impact a decision.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1657" target="_blank">00:27:37.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I know when I worked in venture capital, one concern we had any time a founder was raising money for their business was, how much money did they owe?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1666" target="_blank">00:27:46.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And if someone had a lot of unpaid outstanding debt, that might be a red flag for us funding their company.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1673" target="_blank">00:27:53.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Employers can also do this from time to time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1675" target="_blank">00:27:55.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So, just know that your credit score, your credit report, the impacts they can have are not just the rates, it could impact your job.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1681" target="_blank">00:28:01.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So, let's talk about scores.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1683" target="_blank">00:28:03.300</a></span> | <span class="t">How were these scores even calculated?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1685" target="_blank">00:28:05.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So, back in 1956, engineer Bill Fair and mathematician Earl Isaac created a company called the Fair Isaac Corporation, or FICO, which was a data analytics company.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1696" target="_blank">00:28:16.520</a></span> | <span class="t">They developed the first credit scoring system in 1958, and by 1992, the FICO risk scores were available through all three major credit reporting bureaus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1706" target="_blank">00:28:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And three years later, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac both started recommending the FICO scores as the standard for evaluating U.S. mortgage loan applications.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1714" target="_blank">00:28:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">That recommendation was a pivotal moment in the widespread adoption of the FICO score, which traditionally ranges from 300 to 850, though you will learn sometimes up to 900.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1725" target="_blank">00:28:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And after all, if a bank is using a FICO score for their mortgages, why would anyone use a different score for other lines of credit, like a credit card?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1733" target="_blank">00:28:53.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So, because of this standardization from the U.S. government, it just became widespread, and it's because of all of that that the FICO score is used by 90% of all top U.S. lenders.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1744" target="_blank">00:29:04.680</a></span> | <span class="t">During the early 2000s, FICO actually went on an acquisition spree, and they scooped up all these different companies that specialized in risk and financial data analytics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1753" target="_blank">00:29:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">By 2020, they had become so dominant that there have been at least 10 different antitrust cases filed against FICO.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1760" target="_blank">00:29:20.540</a></span> | <span class="t">But how does FICO actually come up with this score?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1762" target="_blank">00:29:22.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, it's actually a series of proprietary algorithms because there are so many different FICO scores.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1767" target="_blank">00:29:27.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I think I counted over 20 different FICO scores and models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

scores vary, what they're used for, why you've never heard of them, and why you might want to know about some of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1781" target="_blank">00:29:41.220</a></span> | <span class="t">FICO score has published the components and weights.</span></div><div

up 35% of your score.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1789" target="_blank">00:29:49.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So, that is, have you paid your bills on time?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1792" target="_blank">00:29:52.660</a></span> | <span class="t">30% is from amount owed, which looks at a bunch of factors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1796" target="_blank">00:29:56.520</a></span> | <span class="t">How much do you owe on all your accounts?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1798" target="_blank">00:29:58.280</a></span> | <span class="t">How much do you owe on specific types of accounts, credit card versus mortgage?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1801" target="_blank">00:30:01.780</a></span> | <span class="t">The number of accounts you have with balances.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1804" target="_blank">00:30:04.300</a></span> | <span class="t">How much credit is being utilized?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1806" target="_blank">00:30:06.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And the remaining balance on loans compared to the original amount.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1810" target="_blank">00:30:10.080</a></span> | <span class="t">That utilization factor is a really important one that gets bubbled to the top in almost every dashboard to look at your credit score.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1817" target="_blank">00:30:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, that would technically be if you had $10,000 limit and you're spending $5,000 of it, you're at 50% utilization.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1827" target="_blank">00:30:27.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Length of credit history is the next component.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1829" target="_blank">00:30:29.140</a></span> | <span class="t">That's 15%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1830" target="_blank">00:30:30.500</a></span> | <span class="t">That's just how long you've had credit history for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1832" target="_blank">00:30:32.740</a></span> | <span class="t">What's the average age?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1833" target="_blank">00:30:33.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Next is credit mix, which is what kinds of credit you have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1838" target="_blank">00:30:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you have just a car loan or car and credit card and mortgage?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1841" target="_blank">00:30:41.400</a></span> | <span class="t">That's 10% of your score.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1843" target="_blank">00:30:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And finally, new credit, which is all the inquiries and new lines of credit, which is another 10%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1848" target="_blank">00:30:48.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So, that's the components of your score.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1850" target="_blank">00:30:50.900</a></span> | <span class="t">They create a score based on that and they bucket it into these buckets, which are just FICO's buckets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1857" target="_blank">00:30:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">This isn't necessarily what a lender would use, but they say if you're below a 580, you have a poor score.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1862" target="_blank">00:31:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">580 to 669 is fair.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1864" target="_blank">00:31:04.760</a></span> | <span class="t">670 to 739 is good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1867" target="_blank">00:31:07.420</a></span> | <span class="t">740 to 799 is very good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1869" target="_blank">00:31:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And 800 plus is exceptional.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1871" target="_blank">00:31:11.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, given all the success that FICO had, the three credit reporting agencies actually got really frustrated that they were all paying this third party for the software to analyze their own data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1881" target="_blank">00:31:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So, in 2006, they brought the process in-house and created the VantageScore, which is another scoring model owned by those three major credit reporting agencies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1891" target="_blank">00:31:31.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, now they didn't have to pay a third-party data analytics company to generate credit score based on their data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1898" target="_blank">00:31:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, it's a little bit of a chicken-and-the-egg problem because if you log into most of the credit reporting websites, Experian, Equifax, TransUnion, most of them are still showing and selling you FICO scores because that's what most lenders are using to make decisions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1912" target="_blank">00:31:52.380</a></span> | <span class="t">But as the VantageScore becomes more popular, you'll probably see it being used more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1916" target="_blank">00:31:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's why it's available for free on so many services because they price it so much lower.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1921" target="_blank">00:32:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, when you log into Credit Karma to get your free credit score, you are getting your VantageScore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1926" target="_blank">00:32:06.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But when you're looking to apply for a credit card or a mortgage, they are probably pulling your FICO score.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1932" target="_blank">00:32:12.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it's important to know how those are different.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1934" target="_blank">00:32:14.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm going to share my Vantage and FICO scores and how they differ so you can get a sense of the deviations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1939" target="_blank">00:32:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">VantageScore is also cheaper for other people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1943" target="_blank">00:32:23.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So, if your landlord is requesting a credit score in order to lease you an apartment, they'll probably get a VantageScore because it's much less expensive, maybe $25.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1953" target="_blank">00:32:33.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Or a mortgage lender could get your VantageScore for $50 or $100, whereas a FICO score might be more like $50 to $100 for a single credit check, depending on it's a single or a joint application.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1965" target="_blank">00:32:45.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So, the VantageScore is very similar to the FICO score.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1967" target="_blank">00:32:47.940</a></span> | <span class="t">It uses the same set of numbers, roughly the same scaling system, but they tweak the percentages just enough that you get a different number.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1975" target="_blank">00:32:55.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, VantageScore has a 40% payment history instead of FICO's 35%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1980" target="_blank">00:33:00.240</a></span> | <span class="t">They have recent credit is 5% while FICO's new credit category is 10%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1986" target="_blank">00:33:06.300</a></span> | <span class="t">The balances you have are 11% of Vantage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1990" target="_blank">00:33:10.600</a></span> | <span class="t">In FICO, that's kind of bulked in with amounts owed, which is 30%, which also includes your utilization.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1996" target="_blank">00:33:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it's all pretty similar, slightly tweaked.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=1999" target="_blank">00:33:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">A couple of other differences.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2000" target="_blank">00:33:20.600</a></span> | <span class="t">VantageScore explicitly calls out utilization as extremely important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2005" target="_blank">00:33:25.940</a></span> | <span class="t">FICO describes it similarly, but not as important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2009" target="_blank">00:33:29.420</a></span> | <span class="t">When it comes to history, your VantageScore can come with just one month of credit history.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2014" target="_blank">00:33:34.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it's much more inclusive for people that are new to credit, whereas your FICO score needs at least six months.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2021" target="_blank">00:33:41.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And authorized user accounts, which I'll talk about in a little bit, actually get a little bit less weight in VantageScore versus FICO scores.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2028" target="_blank">00:33:48.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So, there are some subtle differences.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2030" target="_blank">00:33:50.260</a></span> | <span class="t">At the end of the day, they're not that different, but there are about to be some changes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2034" target="_blank">00:33:54.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's because in 2018, the Credit Score Competition Act was signed into law, mandating the use of the VantageScore 4.0 and the FICO 10T models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2044" target="_blank">00:34:04.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I will get into all these models because until I went deep on this, I didn't know that any of these models existed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2051" target="_blank">00:34:11.560</a></span> | <span class="t">But there was government-sponsored mortgage enterprises like the VA that already started adopting VantageScore 4.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2057" target="_blank">00:34:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will phase in using VantageScore, so later this year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2061" target="_blank">00:34:21.720</a></span> | <span class="t">The main thing is that because the VantageScore 4.0 has limited credit history that it can work off of,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2067" target="_blank">00:34:27.420</a></span> | <span class="t">there's about 30-plus million people that might actually be able to get a credit score that couldn't previously.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2073" target="_blank">00:34:33.160</a></span> | <span class="t">The VantageScore 4.0, which is their latest version of the score, actually takes into account trending,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2080" target="_blank">00:34:40.520</a></span> | <span class="t">which is one of the things that's been more interesting for people because it looks at a view over time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2087" target="_blank">00:34:47.580</a></span> | <span class="t">With this change, lenders will be able to choose between getting reports from two of the three major bureaus,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2094" target="_blank">00:34:54.040</a></span> | <span class="t">so they don't need to get all three of them, and they can choose which model they use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2097" target="_blank">00:34:57.780</a></span> | <span class="t">It's going to give a little bit more flexibility.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2099" target="_blank">00:34:59.500</a></span> | <span class="t">It'll be interesting to see how this evolves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2101" target="_blank">00:35:01.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I really wanted to go check my VantageScore 4, but I could not find anywhere to do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2107" target="_blank">00:35:07.340</a></span> | <span class="t">I've heard if you had a Synchrony credit card, you can do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2109" target="_blank">00:35:09.820</a></span> | <span class="t">There are a few credit unions that offer it, but I actually opened up a Synchrony bank account and couldn't get it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2115" target="_blank">00:35:15.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Then I went to Alliant Credit Union, which was the one that required me to unfreeze my checks report</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2120" target="_blank">00:35:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">because I was told they give you a free VantageScore 4.0.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2124" target="_blank">00:35:24.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But as soon as I got my account set up, it said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2126" target="_blank">00:35:26.940</a></span> | <span class="t">not all members will have credit score displayed.</span></div><div

like, but one of the big changes is that they're going to incorporate trended data into the scoring model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2138" target="_blank">00:35:38.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So how your payment history has evolved will be factored in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2141" target="_blank">00:35:41.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, on the flip side, FICO is coming out with the FICO Score 10T.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2145" target="_blank">00:35:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">That's their latest

trending credit data, meaning it looks at your borrowing and payment patterns over 24 months, then just a static snapshot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

them?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2292" target="_blank">00:38:12.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So finding your credit score is

target="_blank">00:38:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're going to a mortgage and that bank is going to use a FICO 9, knowing your vantage score 3 isn't quite as helpful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2306" target="_blank">00:38:26.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Most companies out there that offer free credit scores as part of free credit monitoring, think Credit Karma, NerdWallet, they only offer your vantage score.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2315" target="_blank">00:38:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so again, as of present, that's only being used by about 10% of lenders.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2319" target="_blank">00:38:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So you probably want to take a look at your FICO score.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2322" target="_blank">00:38:42.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Now there are a number of places to get a free FICO score.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2325" target="_blank">00:38:45.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So myfico.com, Experian's website, you can get one free score, but they usually don't give you the score on all three bureaus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2334" target="_blank">00:38:54.720</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, I haven't found any place to get all three bureaus score, whether it's Vantage or FICO, without paying for it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2341" target="_blank">00:39:01.060</a></span> | <span class="t">A number of credit card companies also give you access to credit scores.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2345" target="_blank">00:39:05.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Amex Capital One, you can go in and check, even if you don't have a card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2349" target="_blank">00:39:09.080</a></span> | <span class="t">At least that's what I read.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2350" target="_blank">00:39:10.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I have a card on both those issuers, so I couldn't confirm that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2353" target="_blank">00:39:13.620</a></span> | <span class="t">But keep in mind, you're giving them access to your credit and you're giving them a working email address.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2359" target="_blank">00:39:19.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So you're kind of giving them a bunch of information, just like Credit Karma is doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2363" target="_blank">00:39:23.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Credit Karma is trying to promote products to you.</span></div><div class="c"><span

sending you mailers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2368" target="_blank">00:39:28.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You might want those mailers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2370" target="_blank">00:39:30.220</a></span> | <span class="t">They might be offers with elevated bonuses, so that's great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2373" target="_blank">00:39:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">But just keep in mind, that's part of what's happening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2375" target="_blank">00:39:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">As a few examples, if you have Discover, I believe you get TransUnion's FICO score 8.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2381" target="_blank">00:39:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Bank of America will give you a FICO score.</span></div><div class="c"><span

figure out, okay, where could I get every single score?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2392" target="_blank">00:39:52.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was just a little bit down this rabbit hole, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2395" target="_blank">00:39:55.700</a></span> | <span class="t">I was just looking for my Vantage score and my FICO score.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2398" target="_blank">00:39:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was able to get 5 out of 6.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2401" target="_blank">00:40:01.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So I got my Vantage on all 3 bureaus, my FICO on 2 bureaus.</span></div><div

this episode, I should really just get all of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2410" target="_blank">00:40:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was like, do I really want to spend an hour trying to dig and open up new bank accounts?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2414" target="_blank">00:40:14.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Or do I just pay $30 to my FICO and get access to their dashboard?</span></div><div

class="t">And when I looked at it, I was like, oh, this is cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2429" target="_blank">00:40:29.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Now I get all 3 scores.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2430" target="_blank">00:40:30.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And then it was like, well, what is the purpose of what you're scoring?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2434" target="_blank">00:40:34.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So I looked on and the main one was my FICO score 8.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2437" target="_blank">00:40:37.460</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm looking at it right now.</span></div><div

type.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2442" target="_blank">00:40:42.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was like, mortgages?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2443" target="_blank">00:40:43.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And then it says, well, the most widely used score for mortgages is your FICO 5 with Equifax,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2451" target="_blank">00:40:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">your FICO 4 with TransUnion, and your FICO 2 with Experian.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

target="_blank">00:41:12.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's a FICO AutoScore 8, a FICO AutoScore 9.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2475" target="_blank">00:41:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">There's the old FICO AutoScore 5, 4, and 2.</span></div><div class="c"><span

8 is the most widely used.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2485" target="_blank">00:41:25.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And it is on a scale of 250 to 900.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2489" target="_blank">00:41:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Then I

used.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2505" target="_blank">00:41:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">The bank card scores are all on a scale of 250 to 900, while the FICO score is on 300 to 850.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2513" target="_blank">00:41:53.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I clicked new versions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2515" target="_blank">00:41:55.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was like, oh, wow, there's a bank card score 10, an AutoScore 10, a FICO score 10.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2520" target="_blank">00:42:00.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's where I also found the FICO score 10T.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2523" target="_blank">00:42:03.800</a></span> | <span class="t">That's that new score that's using trending data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2526" target="_blank">00:42:06.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So what did I learn looking at all this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2527" target="_blank">00:42:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, it was super interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2528" target="_blank">00:42:08.760</a></span> | <span class="t">If I look across all of my scores, it's a little tricky because some of them are on different scales, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2534" target="_blank">00:42:14.820</a></span> | <span class="t">These auto scores are up to 900 and the other scores are up to 850.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2538" target="_blank">00:42:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">But if I look at my FICO 9, which is on a scale of 300 to 850, I rank pretty high, 846, 849, 839.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2547" target="_blank">00:42:27.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So close to perfect score, which will dovetail into our next conversation about how many credit cards can you open?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2554" target="_blank">00:42:34.360</a></span> | <span class="t">How many signup bonuses can you get and keep a high credit score?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2557" target="_blank">00:42:37.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And as someone with over 20 credit cards at this point right now that are active, I'm still at a very high credit score.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2564" target="_blank">00:42:44.700</a></span> | <span class="t">But my FICO score 8 was a little lower.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2567" target="_blank">00:42:47.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So anywhere from 3 to about 20 points lower.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2572" target="_blank">00:42:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">But my Vantage score was meaningfully lower.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2575" target="_blank">00:42:55.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So all my FICO scores, at least FICO 9, were in the 839 to 849 range.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2582" target="_blank">00:43:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And my Vantage score was in the 774 to 779 range.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2586" target="_blank">00:43:06.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So I can't quite explain that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2588" target="_blank">00:43:08.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It is what it is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2589" target="_blank">00:43:09.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It's why I really wanted to go look more deeply at the Vantage score 4.0, but I couldn't find it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2592" target="_blank">00:43:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Similarly, the most common score for your mortgage is your FICO 5, 4, and 2.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2600" target="_blank">00:43:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And for whatever reason, Equifax uses 5, TransUnion uses 4, and Experian uses 2 for mortgages, I guess.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2606" target="_blank">00:43:26.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And those were all in the high 700s as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2611" target="_blank">00:43:31.340</a></span> | <span class="t">All of the other scores that weren't legacy 2, 4, 5 models were all in the high 800s, close to 850.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2619" target="_blank">00:43:39.860</a></span> | <span class="t">I think I had one score that was 862, which is when I first realized, oh, the scale must go higher than 850.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2627" target="_blank">00:43:47.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And so looking at all of this, there is a wide range.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2630" target="_blank">00:43:50.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But at the end of the day, the lowest score I had amongst all of these different bureaus was 765.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2637" target="_blank">00:43:57.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So yes, the range of 765 up to, I guess, 862 was the max.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2642" target="_blank">00:44:02.900</a></span> | <span class="t">They're all great scores.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2643" target="_blank">00:44:03.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And yes, there were some low ones, but none of them actually fell into a meaningfully different bucket.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2650" target="_blank">00:44:10.020</a></span> | <span class="t">When I was looking at the auto interest rates, the bucket was 781, I think was the floor for exceptional, maybe, for the highest interest rates.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2657" target="_blank">00:44:17.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So maybe if they were using Vantage or the old FICO score 3, I wouldn't have qualified for the best auto interest rate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2664" target="_blank">00:44:24.380</a></span> | <span class="t">But for the most part, when you're looking at lending decisions, I've more commonly been told that 760 and above is all the same.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2671" target="_blank">00:44:31.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And all of these scores were above 760.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2674" target="_blank">00:44:34.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So I didn't learn as much as I was hoping to about all of this, but I could go a little deeper for each of these scores and look at the components of it and how they were having an impact.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2685" target="_blank">00:44:45.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And the main two things that impacted my score, which I think is why certain models were getting impacted differently, was the amount of debt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2693" target="_blank">00:44:53.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And keep in mind, that amount of debt category is where utilization lives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2697" target="_blank">00:44:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And that was the flag that came out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2698" target="_blank">00:44:58.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And that was that I had 9% utilization.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2701" target="_blank">00:45:01.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, over the last few months, I have definitely been doing a lot of gift cards and Costco gold, which has resulted in a lot of high balances for things that aren't necessarily expenses, but will get reimbursed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2719" target="_blank">00:45:19.980</a></span> | <span class="t">But I wasn't paying those credit cards off early.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2722" target="_blank">00:45:22.220</a></span> | <span class="t">I was paying them at the statement date.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2723" target="_blank">00:45:23.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So throughout the month, depending on when you pull from those banks and when those banks actually report to the credit bureaus, it might look like I have higher than normal utilization.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2732" target="_blank">00:45:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of the things I noticed in the past was I could have a score that swings 60, 70 points in a given month based on that utilization data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2742" target="_blank">00:45:42.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I suspect if I go look at my Vantage score over time and compare it to my FICO score, you'll probably see something a little differently.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2751" target="_blank">00:45:51.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And they'll probably be a little bit more similar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2753" target="_blank">00:45:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe the Vantage scores right now are getting more recent data than the FICO scores.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2759" target="_blank">00:45:59.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not entirely sure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2761" target="_blank">00:46:01.080</a></span> | <span class="t">The other one that was the only thing that kind of had a yellow color.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2763" target="_blank">00:46:03.980</a></span> | <span class="t">It was like bright green is you don't have any late payments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2766" target="_blank">00:46:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Your average age of accounts is almost 10 years and you've got 13 different accounts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2770" target="_blank">00:46:10.840</a></span> | <span

so.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2774" target="_blank">00:46:14.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Amount of new credit is the one where I had a yellow flag.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2778" target="_blank">00:46:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And in one of them, I think it was an orange flag because the most recent account was open 3 months ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2784" target="_blank">00:46:24.900</a></span> | <span class="t">I've had a handful of inquiries.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2787" target="_blank">00:46:27.580</a></span> | <span class="t">I recently went on a little bit of what I'll call an Aparama, which is opening, I think, 5 cards in the last few weeks.</span></div><div

bucket.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2800" target="_blank">00:46:40.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So, some of those haven't even posted, but I think that'll have an impact.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2803" target="_blank">00:46:43.960</a></span> | <span

multiple credit cards hurt your credit score?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2830" target="_blank">00:47:10.120</a></span> | <span

great image, and I've linked to it in past episode show notes, where this person on Twitter shared their credit journey for him and his wife, Chad and Hannah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2842" target="_blank">00:47:22.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Over the course of about 18 months or maybe 14 months, when they opened, I think it was 26 credit cards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2849" target="_blank">00:47:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And the most fascinating thing is that his wife, Hannah, started at a 670 and ended up at a 798.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2857" target="_blank">00:47:37.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And he started at a 794 and ended up at a 805.</span></div><div class="c"><span

credit scores went up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2866" target="_blank">00:47:46.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And that makes sense when you think about it because their payment history doesn't really impact it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2872" target="_blank">00:47:52.780</a></span> | <span class="t">The amount they owe, while that's the bucket, big factor of that is utilization, which goes way down, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2896" target="_blank">00:48:16.120</a></span> | <span class="t">It has no impact there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2897" target="_blank">00:48:17.260</a></span> | <span class="t">What's your average age of account?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2899" target="_blank">00:48:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">It will have an impact there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2900" target="_blank">00:48:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">New credit, not as good because it's a bunch of new inquiries, but your credit mix, more credit cards, more revolving accounts is actually good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2911" target="_blank">00:48:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Or at least it's not bad.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2912" target="_blank">00:48:32.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So, the more cards you have in good standing, the better your credit score usually is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2917" target="_blank">00:48:37.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And I've seen that happen in this chart.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2919" target="_blank">00:48:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I've seen it happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2920" target="_blank">00:48:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, that's super fascinating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2922" target="_blank">00:48:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, keep in mind, this person did open 26 cards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2925" target="_blank">00:48:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">But one thing to note is that business cards don't usually show up on your personal credit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2930" target="_blank">00:48:50.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I mentioned that earlier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2931" target="_blank">00:48:51.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you might get the inquiry from a business card getting opened, but it actually doesn't show up on your credit report.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2937" target="_blank">00:48:57.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I found a table.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2940" target="_blank">00:49:00.020</a></span> | <span class="t">It's about five years old.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2941" target="_blank">00:49:01.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I don't want to say it's all perfect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2942" target="_blank">00:49:02.860</a></span> | <span class="t">But some banks, notably TD, Discover, and maybe some cards from Capital One or Barclays, do show up on your personal credit report.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2950" target="_blank">00:49:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is all if you have no negative activity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2952" target="_blank">00:49:12.860</a></span> | <span class="t">The number of banks that report your business credit card activity to your personal credit report is limited.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2959" target="_blank">00:49:19.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you have negative activity, almost all of them, at least according to this chart I found, do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2965" target="_blank">00:49:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So, keep that in mind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2966" target="_blank">00:49:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, how do I think about this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2967" target="_blank">00:49:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, knowing your credit score and knowing how many frequent cards you've opened can have a lot of benefits.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2973" target="_blank">00:49:33.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So, one, there are application rules at a lot of different banks that say, okay, how many cards have you opened?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2980" target="_blank">00:49:40.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Chase is notorious for this 524 rule.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2982" target="_blank">00:49:42.220</a></span> | <span class="t">You can't get a card if you've applied for five or more cards in the last 24 months.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2986" target="_blank">00:49:46.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But they're getting that number from your credit report.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2989" target="_blank">00:49:49.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So, if your credit report doesn't show a card because it's a business card, well, they're not going to count it towards the 524 rule.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2995" target="_blank">00:49:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">This might seem crazy, but a lot of people have reported that they don't even count Chase cards,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=2999" target="_blank">00:49:59.520</a></span> | <span class="t">which means they're not combining the credit report data with the own data they have on you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3005" target="_blank">00:50:05.240</a></span> | <span class="t">They're just looking at the credit report.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3006" target="_blank">00:50:06.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you can learn these application rules for each bank and learn how to use your credit report to the advantage of making sure you time things correctly and are doing things in the right order.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3017" target="_blank">00:50:17.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm going to do a whole future episode on application rules by bank.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3020" target="_blank">00:50:20.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So, stay tuned for that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3022" target="_blank">00:50:22.020</a></span> | <span class="t">It also helps when you understand what banks are sensitive to and how they operate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3027" target="_blank">00:50:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So, Capital One is notoriously really sensitive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3029" target="_blank">00:50:29.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So, if you have a bunch of recent inquiries, it might not be the right bank to apply for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3034" target="_blank">00:50:34.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Amex, if you already have an Amex card, usually Amex doesn't even pull your credit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3040" target="_blank">00:50:40.060</a></span> | <span class="t">I know this because I just applied for and got approved for a Delta Amex card, I think it was two days ago,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3045" target="_blank">00:50:45.820</a></span> | <span class="t">and I had all three credit reports frozen and they still approved.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3050" target="_blank">00:50:50.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So, not only do I not have an inquiry, the card doesn't even show up on my credit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3054" target="_blank">00:50:54.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So, as far as any other bank is concerned, that didn't matter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3057" target="_blank">00:50:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So, that's opening a card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3059" target="_blank">00:50:59.520</a></span> | <span class="t">What about closing a card?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3060" target="_blank">00:51:00.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I get this question all the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3062" target="_blank">00:51:02.380</a></span> | <span class="t">What should I do if I have a card?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3064" target="_blank">00:51:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Usually, it's because the annual fee is high and I don't get any value of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3067" target="_blank">00:51:07.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, a couple things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3069" target="_blank">00:51:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">One, find out whether you're using the card correctly because I found that there are a lot of annual fee cards</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3075" target="_blank">00:51:15.480</a></span> | <span class="t">where if you know how to use the annual fee, you can actually make the card profitable even if you're not spending on it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3082" target="_blank">00:51:22.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I will also do a whole episode on premium cards and talk about those perks and benefits and how to get the most out of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3088" target="_blank">00:51:28.260</a></span> | <span class="t">But let's say you're thinking, I don't really want this card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3091" target="_blank">00:51:31.020</a></span> | <span class="t">What will happen if I cancel it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3092" target="_blank">00:51:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, it won't impact your payment history.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3095" target="_blank">00:51:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Amounts owed, not great there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3097" target="_blank">00:51:37.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Your total

how to mitigate that if you close it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3101" target="_blank">00:51:41.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Your length of credit history really has a different impact.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3104" target="_blank">00:51:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">If it's your oldest card you've ever had, it could have a huge impact.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3107" target="_blank">00:51:47.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But if it is a card you opened recently, when you're looking at your average age,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3112" target="_blank">00:51:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">it might actually bring your average age up so it could have a good impact.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3115" target="_blank">00:51:55.900</a></span> | <span class="t">If it is your oldest card, I'd really strongly encourage you to find a way not to cancel it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3120" target="_blank">00:52:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'll talk about that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3121" target="_blank">00:52:01.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Won't really impact your new credit, your credit mix.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3124" target="_blank">00:52:04.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You still will have the card on your account.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3126" target="_blank">00:52:06.940</a></span> | <span class="t">It just won't be open.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3128" target="_blank">00:52:08.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So, smaller impact there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3130" target="_blank">00:52:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So, what I would say is, if you have a card that you've had for a really long time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3135" target="_blank">00:52:15.600</a></span> | <span class="t">like I said, avoid closing it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3137" target="_blank">00:52:17.380</a></span> | <span class="t">But let's say it has an annual fee and you don't want to have to pay it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3140" target="_blank">00:52:20.380</a></span> | <span class="t">You're not getting any benefits.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3141" target="_blank">00:52:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">A few things you can do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3142" target="_blank">00:52:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">You can always ask for a retention offer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3145" target="_blank">00:52:25.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you might get an offer that's waive the annual fee.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3147" target="_blank">00:52:27.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Spend a few thousand dollars and get 20, 30, 40, 50,000 points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3152" target="_blank">00:52:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So, that's one option that could mitigate that cost.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3154" target="_blank">00:52:34.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Another, product change to another card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3157" target="_blank">00:52:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">There are a ton of cards at a lot of different issuers that you can change to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3161" target="_blank">00:52:41.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you could change from the Delta card that includes lounge access and costs hundreds of dollars</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3166" target="_blank">00:52:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">to a free or inexpensive Delta card that doesn't.</span></div><div

it on your credit history without having to pay an annual fee.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3178" target="_blank">00:52:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">If none of those work and you're just dead set on canceling, one, make sure you use all of your points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3184" target="_blank">00:53:04.780</a></span> | <span class="t">If it's your last card linked to a bank rewards program, especially because you will forfeit them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3189" target="_blank">00:53:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">If you close your last Amex and you have membership rewards points, they're gone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3192" target="_blank">00:53:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Number two, consider moving the credit to another card before you close, especially if it's a really high limit card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3199" target="_blank">00:53:19.800</a></span> | <span class="t">This could make it trickier to open a new card because the bank might be extending all the credit they're willing to extend.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3207" target="_blank">00:53:27.340</a></span> | <span class="t">But, let's say you have a credit card at Bank of America and has a $50,000 limit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3212" target="_blank">00:53:32.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And you just opened a new card and it has a $10,000 limit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3215" target="_blank">00:53:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So, when you're looking at your utilization, you've got $60,000.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3218" target="_blank">00:53:38.620</a></span> | <span class="t">If you close that Bank of America card, your total limit available to you is $10,000.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3223" target="_blank">00:53:43.260</a></span> | <span class="t">But, if you had two cards at Bank of America, you only want to close one, you can usually call the bank and move the credit over.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3229" target="_blank">00:53:49.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you could take two cards with $30,000 limits, move one to be $59,000 and the other to be $1,000 and then close the $1,000.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3237" target="_blank">00:53:57.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So, the way that this could be a pain is you might then later apply for another card at that bank and be denied because they don't have enough credit to give you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3246" target="_blank">00:54:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">But, oftentimes, you can call up a phone number and ask them if there is any way to move credit to this new card and get that open.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3253" target="_blank">00:54:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So, when used correctly, I think playing the points game can actually build up your credit score and keep it more durable and higher for a much longer time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

<span class="t">Now, let's talk about what to do if you want to improve your credit score.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3338" target="_blank">00:55:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">The simplest way is to pay down your debt, keep your debt low, keep your old cards open, and have a diverse credit mix.</span></div><div

target="_blank">00:55:59.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Another thing is you can actually start adding positive history to your credit report.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3365" target="_blank">00:56:05.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And there are certain places and services that you can use to report rent and utility payments to your report.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3372" target="_blank">00:56:12.740</a></span> | <span

class="t">Simple Bills, Experian Boost, and others will report some of those payments and help your credit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3380" target="_blank">00:56:20.900</a></span> | <span class="t">There are also debit cards that will start reporting to credit bureaus as you use them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3386" target="_blank">00:56:26.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, there are a lot of options there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3388" target="_blank">00:56:28.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Also, don't discount raising your credit limit for an individual card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3392" target="_blank">00:56:32.420</a></span> | <span class="t">You can usually request a credit line increase.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3395" target="_blank">00:56:35.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And of course, if your credit goes up and you aren't spending more money, that lowers your utilization and can have an impact.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3402" target="_blank">00:56:42.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So, obviously, with all the positive impacts of having a good credit score, being able to play the points game, as many of you do, myself included,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3411" target="_blank">00:56:51.300</a></span> | <span class="t">it's always great to help someone getting started with a great credit score.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3416" target="_blank">00:56:56.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So, if you're helping someone who's just turning 18, you're helping someone who's moved to the U.S.,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3422" target="_blank">00:57:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">First option is a secured credit card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3424" target="_blank">00:57:04.140</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a credit card that requires a deposit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3426" target="_blank">00:57:06.180</a></span> | <span class="t">That deposit is, of course, refundable, but then it gives access to spend.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3429" target="_blank">00:57:09.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Important distinction is it is not a prepaid card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3432" target="_blank">00:57:12.100</a></span> | <span class="t">It's similar, but you can take the money out much more easily.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3434" target="_blank">00:57:14.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, this is a great option.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3436" target="_blank">00:57:16.820</a></span> | <span

class="t">Note that for both of these kinds of cards, anyone under 21 will probably need to have proof of income or a cosigner to get approved.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3446" target="_blank">00:57:26.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Some popular cards for people with little to no credit.</span></div><div

bit of history on your credit report.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3454" target="_blank">00:57:34.000</a></span> | <span

<span class="t">Surprisingly, Amex cards are quite easy and they do pre-approvals on their website.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3465" target="_blank">00:57:45.420</a></span> | <span class="t">This seems counterintuitive because they're usually more premium cards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3468" target="_blank">00:57:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yet, we've now had four au

they're getting some of these pre-approvals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3492" target="_blank">00:58:12.240</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">01:00:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, if you don't trust that person, you might not want to even give them the credit card to spend,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3611" target="_blank">01:00:11.400</a></span> | <span class="t">have the authorized user card shipped to your address, don't even let them have access to the card if you don't want to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3617" target="_blank">01:00:17.320</a></span> | <span class="t">but it would really potentially boost their credit score.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3620" target="_blank">01:00:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So, that's a great optimization and hack that I think is super helpful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3625" target="_blank">01:00:25.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, keep in mind, negative information is also shared.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3628" target="_blank">01:00:28.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you definitely don't want to add someone to a credit card that has any negative payment history on there,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3634" target="_blank">01:00:34.580</a></span> | <span class="t">or you might actually impact their score negatively.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3637" target="_blank">01:00:37.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I have read a lot of places that say Experian isn't including authorized user data on credit reports.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3643" target="_blank">01:00:43.060</a></span> | <span class="t">There is a blog from this year that says it is included.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3646" target="_blank">01:00:46.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I think a lot of this seems to be a little bit...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3651" target="_blank">01:00:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Not gray area because it's not allowed or bad, but gray area because it's not an official rule that's published anywhere.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3659" target="_blank">01:00:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But there is one more situation, which is, let's say you're someone from outside of the US and you just moved to the US and you don't have any credit, but you actually did overseas.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3668" target="_blank">01:01:08.540</a></span> | <span class="t">There is a cool company and I actually got to know the founder because we went through a little bit of an incubator together and that's called Nova Credit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3676" target="_blank">01:01:16.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And what they use is they take credit reports from overseas bureaus around the world and if you have a great credit score there and you're able to confirm your address in the US,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3687" target="_blank">01:01:27.560</a></span> | <span class="t">they can help translate that over right now to Amex and Verizon to be able to help you get approved for those loans.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3696" target="_blank">01:01:36.540</a></span> | <span class="t">I think they also can sometimes work with auto loans and those kinds of things, but I know they have a partnership with Amex that makes it easier to get approved for an Amex card if you have good credit somewhere else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3706" target="_blank">01:01:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">That's something else to keep in mind if you are non-US and you're moving to the US and you're trying to get access to credit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3712" target="_blank">01:01:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's all personal. I'll do a quick run through on business credit scores because I thought it was just fascinating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3718" target="_blank">01:01:58.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Just like there are multiple personal credit scores, there are several types of business credit scores.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3722" target="_blank">01:02:02.300</a></span> | <span class="t">The main players here are Equifax, Experian, Dun & Bradstreet and LexisNexis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3727" target="_blank">01:02:07.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Though the Small Business Financial Exchange is actually a really important organization here that collects lending data,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3734" target="_blank">01:02:14.120</a></span> | <span class="t">but it doesn't actually create reports and scores. It actually provides that data to some of those companies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3739" target="_blank">01:02:19.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Many of those reports include all the similar information, payment history, age of accounts, credit utilizations that you see on credit reports for personals, but for businesses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3749" target="_blank">01:02:29.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I pulled two of mine for my company, the one that this podcast operates under, because they were free from Bank of America and I got my scores there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3757" target="_blank">01:02:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I wanted to pull the full reports, but an interesting thing is that they are $50 to $200 each and the data is tied to the business.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3765" target="_blank">01:02:45.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So I've opened some credit cards at different companies over my life and there's not always an easy way with a bank to change the business associated with a card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3775" target="_blank">01:02:55.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So for me to pull all my business credit reports, I'd actually have to pull them for four or five different businesses, which would cost, I don't know, anywhere from $300 to maybe $1,000.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3786" target="_blank">01:03:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">What I did do was pull the two most interesting ones that I could get for free, which were my Dun & Bradstreet delinquency predictor score, which was a 502, which according to their scale is of moderate risk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3801" target="_blank">01:03:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And the Dun & Bradstreet small business financial exchange score, which I got a 936, which puts me in the low risk camp.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3809" target="_blank">01:03:29.500</a></span> | <span class="t">You can get those free if you have a Business Bank of America account.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3812" target="_blank">01:03:32.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Otherwise, I think you have to pay for a lot of these.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3815" target="_blank">01:03:35.340</a></span> | <span class="t">But one interesting thing I did notice was when I was searching every business that I've used, even if it was a sole proprietorship for opening a card, showed up when I searched.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3825" target="_blank">01:03:45.220</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it was Experian for my business credit reports.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3827" target="_blank">01:03:47.380</a></span> | <span class="t">I didn't pay for them, but they were all there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3829" target="_blank">01:03:49.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And I looked at this table, and I'll link to this article about which business credit cards report to rich reports.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3835" target="_blank">01:03:55.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of the interesting things was while very few of them were reporting to personal, all the major banks that you could imagine, Capital One, Bank of America, Chase, Citi, Amex, Wells Fargo, they all report to the SBFE, the small business financial exchange.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3851" target="_blank">01:04:11.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And so they seem to be the main source of all this information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3856" target="_blank">01:04:16.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, you can't pull that from anywhere, but that seems to be where all this information is going.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3861" target="_blank">01:04:21.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And so if you wanted to pull a report, I would look at one that's backed by that data because they seem to have the most information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3868" target="_blank">01:04:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">At least that's where most credit cards are reporting information to on the business side.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3872" target="_blank">01:04:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3873" target="_blank">01:04:33.140</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that's it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3875" target="_blank">01:04:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I tried to be as comprehensive as I could.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3878" target="_blank">01:04:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I tried to cover everything I could find on credit scores, credit reports, how this impacts everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3882" target="_blank">01:04:42.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm excited to talk about how application rules vary by bank and how you can use this data as you're playing this whole game of earning points and rewards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3890" target="_blank">01:04:50.980</a></span> | <span class="t">But for today, I really hope you found this valuable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK7H3ID7OBw&t=3894" target="_blank">01:04:54.520</a></span> | <span class="t">If you have any questions,
