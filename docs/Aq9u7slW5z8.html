It doesn't even</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=74">00:01:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">like it if you ask it for its name. I've done a video on this. But now let's get to the good stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=79">00:01:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Step three you can link to articles, pdfs, academic papers and even physical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=85">00:01:25.800</a></span> | <span class="t">text and engage in a dialogue with bing about what's inside. This is truly revolutionary.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=92">00:01:32.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I linked to an article in today's new york times about how leonardo da vinci had thoughts about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=97">00:01:37.780</a></span> | <span class="t">gravity even before newton and I simply asked eli5 explain it like i'm five.

I could rave about this for ages I've just got so much more to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=120">00:02:00.900</a></span> | <span class="t">show you. But what did I mean by engaging with physical text? You can take a photo of anything,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=125">00:02:05.740</a></span> | <span class="t">for example this math problem.

Drag</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=131">00:02:11.500</a></span> | <span class="t">the file onto the screen and this will happen. Click on text to extract the text. Grab the text,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=138">00:02:18.520</a></span> | <span class="t">in this case the question and you can guess what's coming next. Yes that's right go to bing and paste</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=145">00:02:25.060</a></span> | <span class="t">the question in. Now you can see that bing has a lot of information about the text. It's a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=145">00:02:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">information. I know the meme is that GPT powered models aren't good at math but as a math tutor I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=150">00:02:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">can say that's old news. I've done plenty of videos on this on my channel, check them out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=155">00:02:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">But AI is getting a lot better at math fast. It gets this question right with a nice explanation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=160">00:02:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But imagine this for physical text that you want to explore in your environment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=164">00:02:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Three steps from the camera to a conversation with a super advanced AI about it.

To demonstrate I asked, generate five original</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=181">00:03:01.180</a></span> | <span class="t">youtube video ideas for a new consumer tech review channel. Detailing the novelty of each one,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=186">00:03:06.620</a></span> | <span class="t">ensure the topics are trending in 2023 and write a detailed synopsis of each video with a hook,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=192">00:03:12.380</a></span> | <span class="t">a challenge and a reveal.

Any one of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=201">00:03:21.020</a></span> | <span class="t">these would make a viable video idea, in this case for youtube. Let's read the first one, make a video</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=205">00:03:25.720</a></span> | <span class="t">about the mac mini 2023, the ultimate desktop computer question mark.

What about twitter? It can do that amazingly too. I follow Tim Urban, always coming</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=232">00:03:52.500</a></span> | <span class="t">up with new interesting ideas and I said write five real interesting ideas for youtube. Write</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=235">00:03:55.700</a></span> | <span class="t">down your original tweets in the style of Tim Urban. And these tweets were incredible. You can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=240">00:04:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">read all of them but take the fourth one. There are more stars in the observable universe than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=244">00:04:04.520</a></span> | <span class="t">grains of sand on all the beaches on earth. But there are also more atoms in a single grain of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=249">00:04:09.160</a></span> | <span class="t">sand than stars in the observable universe. So which is bigger, the universe or a grain of sand?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=254">00:04:14.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I can imagine him asking that. But let's take this a step further by bringing in image generation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=259">00:04:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I asked Bing, generate five incredibly descriptive visual mid-journey prompts on topic four.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=265">00:04:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">It understood exactly what I meant and came up with these examples. I put them into mid-journey</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=270">00:04:30.300</a></span> | <span class="t">and here's what came out. A grain of sand magnified to reveal a complex microcosm. I think the third</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=276">00:04:36.300</a></span> | <span class="t">result is best here. Or what about the universe as a tiny speck inside a giant eye that belongs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=281">00:04:41.500</a></span> | <span class="t">to an unknown cosmic entity? Look at the second example. These would definitely be eye-catching</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=286">00:04:46.760</a></span> | <span class="t">in a social media post. Just quickly, here are some of the others. A surreal collage of different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=295">00:04:55.660</a></span> | <span class="t">images of the earth and the sun. I picked out just a couple of these examples to upscale into a full</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=303">00:05:03.800</a></span> | <span class="t">image with even more detail. And here was one of the results. That is an AI image you can attach to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=310">00:05:10.760</a></span> | <span class="t">a tweet written by an AI. The world is getting really weird. Before we move on to the next step,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=315">00:05:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">let's not forget about the 80/20 principle. Yes, we might let Bing AI do 80% of the work,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=321">00:05:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">but you still have to fact check and make these posts, these ideas,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=325">00:05:25.640</a></span> | <span class="t">even these image generations your own.

And I would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=330">00:05:30.620</a></span> | <span class="t">definitely check its outputs. It does make mistakes. Next, what about using Bing search to actually,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=336">00:05:36.740</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, search?

Compare property price trends, commute to King's Cross times, crime rates,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=348">00:05:48.020</a></span> | <span class="t">median ages, and green spaces in the two London boroughs of Haringey versus Barnet. And here are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=355">00:05:55.220</a></span> | <span class="t">the details.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=355">00:05:55.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And of course, I could continue this conversation by asking more about green spaces, median age,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=362">00:06:02.040</a></span> | <span class="t">etc. Compare this result to Google.

But honestly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=369">00:06:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">these results are just not too useful.

And it gave me five charging points. And these do check out. They are near Big Ben,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=391">00:06:31.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and they are suitable.

Let's look at a couple of the suggestions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=502">00:08:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">It says the introduction is too long and verbose.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=505">00:08:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">It could be shortened by removing unnecessary details and using more concise language.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=510">00:08:30.380</a></span> | <span class="t">For example, instead of saying, I have always been an observant and enthusiastic individual,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=514">00:08:34.700</a></span> | <span class="t">always looking for answers to how and why things work in a particular way,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=518">00:08:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">which is what my student wrote.

Bing goes further and actually rewrites the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=529">00:08:49.520</a></span> | <span class="t">introduction.

It gave reasons</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=541">00:09:01.080</a></span> | <span class="t">for each of its suggestions. And that's vital if you want to learn and improve.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=545">00:09:05.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Next step is Bing's ability to tell jokes and do creative writing. This is kind of a hit and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=551">00:09:11.400</a></span> | <span class="t">miss affair.

Notice what I tried. I said, write five actually funny original jokes, and it found</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=562">00:09:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">jokes from the web. Now, I think some of these are quite funny. For example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=565">00:09:25.480</a></span> | <span class="t">what do you call cheese that isn't yours? Nacho cheese. But these aren't original. It stole these.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=571">00:09:31.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So I said, write five jokes about Twitter. And the first one's decent. Again, these aren't Bing jokes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=577">00:09:37.780</a></span> | <span class="t">though. They're stolen. First joke is, a man tells his doctor, Doc, help me. I'm addicted to Twitter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq9u7slW5z8&t=582">00:09:42.100</a></span> | <span class="t">The doctor replies, sorry, I don't follow you.
