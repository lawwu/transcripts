I want to get my hands dirty with actual advice that you can put</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh5FAAD-C1s&t=23" target="_blank">00:00:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">into action and help your life today.

All right, so here's the question. You hate your inbox, let's say. You open it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh5FAAD-C1s&t=40" target="_blank">00:00:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">it's full of stuff. It stresses you out. Why does it stress you out and what can we do about it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh5FAAD-C1s&t=46" target="_blank">00:00:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">To answer this question, I think it is really important to look at all of that junk sitting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh5FAAD-C1s&t=52" target="_blank">00:00:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">there in your inbox and divide it up into categories. This is a key thing that's often</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh5FAAD-C1s&t=58" target="_blank">00:00:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">missing when we give advice about email is that the different types of messages merit different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh5FAAD-C1s&t=65" target="_blank">00:01:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">responses. So roughly speaking, I can divide the messages you see in that stress inducing inbox</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh5FAAD-C1s&t=70" target="_blank">00:01:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">into three categories. Number one, broadcast, information being broadcast to you that does</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh5FAAD-C1s&t=77" target="_blank">00:01:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">not require a response. It may or may not be interesting to you. So this could be newsletters</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh5FAAD-C1s&t=83" target="_blank">00:01:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">like my newsletter, which of course you should subscribe to account newport.com. It could be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh5FAAD-C1s&t=87" target="_blank">00:01:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">announcements from the HR department and your organization or it could be those annoying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh5FAAD-C1s&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">sales emails that any store that you've ever given your email address to for any reason bombard you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh5FAAD-C1s&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">with as if what really matters to you right now is that the 15% sale at Levi's is going to end</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh5FAAD-C1s&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">next week. So those are broadcast messages. Then you have questions. This is my term for emails</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh5FAAD-C1s&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that have something that require a response to you, but probably just one response.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh5FAAD-C1s&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Hey, Cal, can you let me know what my grade is in the class right now? Can you remind me again</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh5FAAD-C1s&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">of when our next meeting is? What do you think? Who do you think we should nominate for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh5FAAD-C1s&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">steering committee that we're putting together? So you know, someone needs information from you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh5FAAD-C1s&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">You can give that information in an email response was probably just going to be one response.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh5FAAD-C1s&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">The third category messages are conversational. These are messages that are part of a longer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh5FAAD-C1s&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">back and forth conversation. So now maybe you're trying to figure out when you are going to meet</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh5FAAD-C1s&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">with a client tomorrow. And you're going back and forth. Hey, what about in the afternoon? They say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh5FAAD-C1s&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">no, you're like, Okay, I can do the morning, but probably not nine. And like, well, how close to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh5FAAD-C1s&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">nine, you know what I mean, back and forth. So it's a message that's part of many messages that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh5FAAD-C1s&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">are going back and forth, that sort of haphazard unscheduled manner. So the gap between each</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh5FAAD-C1s&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">message in the next is unpredictable as part of an ongoing conversation. So when you look at your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh5FAAD-C1s&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">inbox, and you feel that stress, you're seeing a mix of all three different types of messages in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh5FAAD-C1s&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">there. Now having these three types is useful because the response to each is different. Let's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh5FAAD-C1s&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">start with the low hanging fruit, which are broadcast. You hear a lot of advice, especially</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh5FAAD-C1s&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">from more tech oriented individuals who like having tool based solutions surrounding broadcast,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh5FAAD-C1s&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">oh my god, I get too many of these emails, I wish I could tame it. This is not a major problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh5FAAD-C1s&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It's annoying. If you have a bunch of broadcast messages in there that most of them you don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh5FAAD-C1s&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">care about, because it's visual clutter, and you have to get around them. But it's not super</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh5FAAD-C1s&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.120</a></span> | <span class="t">stress inducing. A you can ignore them or B, you can just quickly delete or archive them,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh5FAAD-C1s&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">which honestly is actually kind of fulfilling. Is there anything better that when you see a really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh5FAAD-C1s&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">full inbox to be able to make progress get 50% of those messages out of there in just two minutes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh5FAAD-C1s&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">by just deleting lots of things. That being said, there are any number of ways you can tame broadcast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh5FAAD-C1s&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">The best feature right now is probably what you'll see in a product like Gmail or Gmail has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh5FAAD-C1s&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">really good AI powered filters.

From what I understand, I don't use social media. But from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh5FAAD-C1s&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">what I understand, those Gmail AI based filters are very good at social media notifications of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh5FAAD-C1s&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">putting them in another folder. So you don't have to see them if you don't want to. Beyond that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh5FAAD-C1s&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">obviously, unsubscribe.

One caveat. If you try to unsubscribe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh5FAAD-C1s&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">from cal newport.com, you and your family will be struck with bad luck for three generations.

But you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh5FAAD-C1s&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">can have a signup address, sign up at whatever.com that you give when everyone needs an email address</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh5FAAD-C1s&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">when the retailer needs an email address when the person at the store wants you to give an email</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh5FAAD-C1s&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">address and you have some address signup at cal newport.com.

Right? That's one thing you can do. And then you have a different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh5FAAD-C1s&t=334" target="_blank">00:05:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">account and go check this occasionally for my newsletters or what have you.

All right, let's talk about question emails. Now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh5FAAD-C1s&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">here's the thing about question emails. If you take an individual question email in isolation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh5FAAD-C1s&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and bring it to me and say, Oh, Cal, thank you for coming. I have this thing I need you to answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh5FAAD-C1s&t=357" target="_blank">00:05:57.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Here you go. It's usually no sweat. It's like, Oh, that's interesting question. Yeah, who should</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh5FAAD-C1s&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">we nominate for this committee? Let me think about that for a minute. Yeah, it should be,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh5FAAD-C1s&t=367" target="_blank">00:06:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, Bob, that makes a good idea.

So in isolation, a question email is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh5FAAD-C1s&t=377" target="_blank">00:06:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">not bad.
