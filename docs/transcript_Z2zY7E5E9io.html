And I remember going back to the Enron days, someone, people criticizing me, even other people in the press saying, but you took a tip from a short seller.</p><p>They're biased. And I, I would say, but, but, but wait, the analysts who have buy ratings on stocks and the portfolio managers who own those stocks are biased too. They want stocks to go up. Everybody's biased. So the trick is a journalist is getting information from all sides and figuring out who you think is right and what makes sense, but it's not avoiding anybody with any bias, but it was really interesting that people saw the bias on the part of short sellers and did not see it on the part of, of, of longs.</p><p>And I think there is that preconception that exists broadly, that somehow you are doing something wrong and you're somehow rooting for a company's failure.</p></div></div></body></html>
