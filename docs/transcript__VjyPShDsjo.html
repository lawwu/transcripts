What important lesson did you learn from it? Not just interesting things you found, but like there aren't that many tokens you consume by the time you're 19. A bunch of them were about the classics.</p><p>Clearly that was important in some way. I mean, one of the things I thought was really fascinating is so when Augustus was first, so he became emperor and he was trying to establish peace and there was no real conception of peace at the time. Like the people's understanding of peace was it is the temporary time between when your enemies will inevitably attack you again.</p><p>So you get like a short rest and he had this view, which is like, look, like we want to change the economy from instead of being so mercenary and like, and kind of militaristic to like actually this positive something. It's like a very novel idea at the time. I think that there's like something that's just really fundamental about that.</p><p>It's like in terms of the bounds on like what people can conceive at the time of like what are rational ways to work and I'm going back to like, and this applies to both the metaverse and the AI stuff, but like a lot of investors and just different people just can't wrap their head around why we would open source this.</p><p>I don't understand. It's like open source, that must just be like the temporary time between which you're making things proprietary, but I actually think it's like this very profound thing in tech that creates a lot of winners, right? And it's, and so I don't know, I don't want to strain the analogy too much, but I do think that there's, there's a lot of times I think ways where you can, that are just like models for building things that people can't even like, they just like often can't wrap their head around how that would be a valuable thing for people to go do, or like a reasonable state of the world that I think there's more reasonable things than people think.</p><p>That's super fascinating. Can I give you my answer, what I was thinking? Sure. You might've gotten from it. This is probably totally off, but just how young some of these people are who have very important roles in the empire, like Caesar Augustus is like, by the time he's 19, he's actually incredibly, one of the most prominent people in Roman politics and he's like leading battles and forming the second triumvirate.</p><p>I wonder if you were like the 19 year old is like, I can actually do this because like Caesar Augustus did this. I think that's an interesting example, both from a lot of history and American history too. I mean, one of my favorite quotes, it's this Picasso quote that all children are artists and the challenge is how do you remain an artist when you grow up?</p><p>And it's like, basically I think, cause when you're younger, I think it's just easier to have kind of wild ideas and you're not, you know, you have no, there are all these analogies to the innovators dilemma that exist in your life as well as your company or whatever you've built.</p><p>Right. So, you know, you're kind of earlier on your trajectory. I think it's easier to pivot and take in new ideas without it disrupting other commitments that you've made to, to different things. And so I don't know, I think that that's an interesting part of running a company is like, how do you, how do you kind of stay dynamic?</p><p>Right. Thank you. Thank you.</p></div></div></body></html>
