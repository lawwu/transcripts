I want to invite you to join me in the beautiful city of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia for an upcoming event called Nomad Capitalist Live. This event will be happening at the end of September, specifically September 25 to September 28 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and this event is called Nomad Capitalist Live.</p><p>This is the annual live event organized by Andrew Henderson and his team at Nomad Capitalist. I myself have long been an admirer of the work that Andrew has done. I put together probably half or three-fourths of my own international plan just from all the free content that Andrew shared on his podcasts and on his YouTube channel, what read his book when it first came out.</p><p>He's got a second edition now. I haven't read that yet, but great book as kind of a good starting point. He has invited me. This is now the second time that I'll be speaking myself at Nomad Capitalist Live. First time was in Mexico a year or two ago. Then I missed it last year.</p><p>I wasn't able to make the event, but this year I will be speaking in Malaysia. If you are interested at all in the world of international planning, that can be international tax planning, building up backup plans, residencies, and getting second citizenships, opening bank accounts all around the world. If you are interested in a plan A, meaning where would I like to move today?</p><p>What would be a great place for me to raise my family today? I don't necessarily want to live in Oakland, California, or Toronto, Canada, or Sydney, Australia. I'm looking for new options. This is a great place for you to go and to begin or continue your international journey. According to the numbers, I believe that there should be over probably around 600 people or more there at this event.</p><p>There's more than 35 speakers. I am one of those all kinds of different topics. What I most appreciated at the most recent one that I was in, which was in Mexico, was how practical the information that was presented was, meaning that Andrew brings his team, not only of international speakers and people like me who are doing this stuff, but also all kinds of consultants, people that work on his team.</p><p>What I experienced in Mexico a couple of years ago was that they pulled out all kinds of information. That's the kind of stuff that's not frequently talked about online. I found that to be really, really helpful. I made a few changes in my own international plan just based upon the stuff that they shared at the conference.</p><p>I thought it was a really great conference when I attended previously. I think this year it's going to be fantastic. A bunch of great speakers. I will let you review the website for all the information and the speakers, but I'll be one of those. I'll be speaking on living overseas with many children.</p><p>The challenge of living as a family overseas and how to build a workable lifestyle because our own financial planning and lifestyle planning and travel planning as a family is different from that of somebody who doesn't travel with young children. It's different than somebody who travels with teenagers, different than somebody who travels without children.</p><p>We just have to make adjustments and adapt our plans for the specifics of our situation. Last year, my family and I, we were in 16 countries total all around the world for a total of ... I'll skip those details, but we'll get into it at the conference, I promise.</p><p>If you would like to come to that event, I would like to invite you to do that. You can do so by going to nomadcapitalist.com/live. Buy a ticket, nomadcapitalist.com/live. That will gain access for you to the event. I will be there for the entirety of the event. I'll make myself as available as possible to hang out with you.</p><p>I'll, of course, be interacting with a lot of the other people that are there at the conference, but I know many of you will come from my audience. As you sign up, please send me an email or something and let me know that you'll be there. I'll try to arrange some special Radical Personal Finance meetups for our gang so you guys can get to know one another as well.</p><p>If you are interested, go to nomadcapitalist.com/live, nomadcapitalist.com/live. Sign up today. There's no special coupon code or anything related to me. Thank you for those of you who always do that, but this time just go to nomadcapitalist.com/live and then send me an email that you're going to go so that I can put you on my list for us to interact in person.</p><p>Look forward to seeing you in Kuala Lumpur in September.</p></div></div></body></html>
