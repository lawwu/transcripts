Well, Gemini 2.5 Pro, the latest version, 0605. Yes, if you are not in America,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWsd2fRzpUo&t=74" target="_blank">00:01:14.060</a></span> | <span class="t">that naming scheme is incredibly confusing.

However,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWsd2fRzpUo&t=83" target="_blank">00:01:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">this is a trick of the eye and they are the same length. In fact, later on, the model doubles down</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWsd2fRzpUo&t=88" target="_blank">00:01:28.700</a></span> | <span class="t">by saying, you can test this yourself by placing a ruler up against the screen.

But that's not even the biggest and best version of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWsd2fRzpUo&t=139" target="_blank">00:02:19.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Gemini 2.5, which is Gemini 2.5 Ultra, unavailable to practically anyone. So all these record benchmark</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWsd2fRzpUo&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.900</a></span> | <span class="t">scores you're going to see, this isn't even their biggest and best model. Each year, I sit and say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWsd2fRzpUo&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">okay, we are going to throw 10x more compute over the course of next year at it, and will we see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWsd2fRzpUo&t=155" target="_blank">00:02:35.620</a></span> | <span class="t">progress?

I think it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWsd2fRzpUo&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.700</a></span> | <span class="t">compute limited in this sense, right? Like, you know, we can all, part of the reason you've seen us do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWsd2fRzpUo&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.220</a></span> | <span class="t">flash, nano flash in pro models, but not an ultra model. It's like for each generation, we feel like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWsd2fRzpUo&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.760</a></span> | <span class="t">we've been able to get the pro model at like, I don't know, 80-90% of ultra's capability. But ultra</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWsd2fRzpUo&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.440</a></span> | <span class="t">would be a lot more slow and a lot more expensive to serve. But what we've been able to do is to go to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWsd2fRzpUo&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.740</a></span> | <span class="t">the next generation and make the next generation's pro as good as the previous generation's ultra,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWsd2fRzpUo&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.240</a></span> | <span class="t">but be able to serve it in a way that it's fast and you can use it and so on. The models we all use the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWsd2fRzpUo&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.500</a></span> | <span class="t">most is maybe like a few months behind the maximum capability we can deliver, right? Because that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWsd2fRzpUo&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.420</a></span> | <span class="t">won't be the fastest, easiest to use, etc. But as the latest version of Gemini 2.5 Pro is apparently</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWsd2fRzpUo&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.580</a></span> | <span class="t">going to be a stable release used by hundreds of millions of people over the coming months, let's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWsd2fRzpUo&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.700</a></span> | <span class="t">quickly dive into those benchmark results. On the right, by the way, you can see the results of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWsd2fRzpUo&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">three iterations of Gemini 2.5 Pro. To be clear, the latest one is what's going to be rolled out to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWsd2fRzpUo&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.300</a></span> | <span class="t">everyone in the coming couple of weeks. On obscure knowledge as tested by humanity's last exam,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWsd2fRzpUo&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.180</a></span> | <span class="t">it nudges out other models. For incredibly challenging science-based questions, it gets 86.4%</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWsd2fRzpUo&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.020</a></span> | <span class="t">when PhDs in those respective domains get around 60%. On very approximate gauges of hallucinations,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWsd2fRzpUo&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.880</a></span> | <span class="t">it scores better than any other model.

Again, it's worth highlighting that Gemini 2.5 Pro is really the middle model of the Gemini</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWsd2fRzpUo&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.680</a></span> | <span class="t">series. You may also notice that the vast majority of these record-breaking scores are on a single</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWsd2fRzpUo&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">attempt. We haven't yet seen the deep-think mode from Gemini 2.5 Pro. That would be roughly the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWsd2fRzpUo&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.760</a></span> | <span class="t">equivalent of the multiple attempts or parallel trials that some of the other models utilize.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWsd2fRzpUo&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.740</a></span> | <span class="t">As for coding, the picture is a lot less clear. When you're talking about multiple languages,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWsd2fRzpUo&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Gemini seems to do better as judged by Ada's polyglot benchmark. When you're talking about a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWsd2fRzpUo&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.700</a></span> | <span class="t">slightly more software engineering focus, like Sweebench Verified, it seems like Claude is still very much in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWsd2fRzpUo&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.920</a></span> | <span class="t">the lead. However, I will make a confession, which is that I was having an issue with connecting a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWsd2fRzpUo&t=316" target="_blank">00:05:16.200</a></span> | <span class="t">domain on Firebase, which is Google on the backend. Now, this was more to do with the app hosting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWsd2fRzpUo&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.780</a></span> | <span class="t">infrastructure, but you'd have thought as a Google entity, Firebase, that Gemini would know the most</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWsd2fRzpUo&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.980</a></span> | <span class="t">about it. Now, I won't show you the full two-hour conversation, but I basically gave up with Gemini 2.5</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWsd2fRzpUo&t=333" target="_blank">00:05:33.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Pro. This was, in fairness, the May instance of Gemini 2.5 Pro, but Claude for Opus was able to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWsd2fRzpUo&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">diagnose the issue almost immediately. And I'm sure everyone who uses these models for coding will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWsd2fRzpUo&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.540</a></span> | <span class="t">have similar anecdotes, where the benchmarks don't always reflect real-world usage. But while we are on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWsd2fRzpUo&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">benchmarks, what about my own benchmark, SymbolBench? Well, I am going to make a confession, which is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWsd2fRzpUo&t=356" target="_blank">00:05:56.200</a></span> | <span class="t">that I thought the latest version of Gemini 2.5 Pro, the one from yesterday, would underperform.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWsd2fRzpUo&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Why did I think that? Well, because the first version of Gemini 2.5 Pro, the one I think from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWsd2fRzpUo&t=367" target="_blank">00:06:07.580</a></span> | <span class="t">March, got 51.6%. But then when we tried the May version of Gemini 2.5 Pro, it was really hard to get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWsd2fRzpUo&t=375" target="_blank">00:06:15.340</a></span> | <span class="t">a full run out of the model. I talked about this on Twitter, but the one run where it agreed to actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWsd2fRzpUo&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.020</a></span> | <span class="t">answer the question. I think it got around 47%. So I actually had a theory that I was going to come</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWsd2fRzpUo&t=386" target="_blank">00:06:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">to you guys and gloat and be like, yeah, they're doing RL for coding and mathematics, but that's kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWsd2fRzpUo&t=391" target="_blank">00:06:31.900</a></span> | <span class="t">of eroding the common sense of the models. This shows how SymbolBench tests things that other benchmarks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWsd2fRzpUo&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.640</a></span> | <span class="t">don't capture. Unfortunately, what actually happened is that when we tested the very latest version of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWsd2fRzpUo&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Gemini 2.5 Pro yesterday evening, we couldn't get, because of rate limiting, a full five runs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWsd2fRzpUo&t=411" target="_blank">00:06:51.700</a></span> | <span class="t">which is why we're not yet reporting the result.
