Once upon a time, the philosopher Diogenes was eating bread and lentils for supper. He was seen by the philosopher Aristippus, who lived comfortably by flattering the king. Said Aristippus, "If you would learn to be subservient to the king, you would not have to live on lentils." Said Diogenes, "Learn to live on lentils and you will not have to be subservient to the king." Friend, if you will learn to live on lentils and practice the skill over time, you can enjoy a lifetime of liberty.</p><p>Now personally, I happen to believe that liberty is something worth enjoying and worth pursuing. There are many paths to liberty, but wherever you are, if you have the skill of living on lentils, read that of course as a metaphor for being able to live frugally, you will be able to avoid a lifetime of subservience.</p><p>That's a powerful concept because it is within your skill and within your ability. These are skills and abilities that you can learn. This is not something where you have to go and earn $10 million in order to be financially free. That may be possible for you, and if so, you should pursue it.</p><p>That may not be possible for you. But it is possible for every person to learn to live on lentils, so you'll not have to be subservient to the king. If you will practice this skill and over your lifetime continually keep yourself free of entangling alliances, you'll be able to be far more impactful in the world.</p><p>If you are a teacher and you possess the skill of living on lentils, you'll be able to teach as you believe you should. You'll be able to teach what you believe you should without fear and concern over your administration and what they believe that you should or should not do.</p><p>If you are a businessman and you are able to live on lentils, you can serve your customers the way that you believe that you should without too much regard to the popularity in the marketplace. If you are a preacher and you will learn to live on lentils, you can present the pure, unadulterated, unfiltered, unmixed word of God to your congregation without fear of their response.</p><p>If you are a politician, you can speak what you believe to be true and act out of principle and stand courageously in a time of moral vacuity. You'll be unconcerned with the loss of your pension and the loss of your salary, and you'll be concerned with what you were sent into office to do in the first place.</p><p>If you're a mother or a father, if you learn to live on lentils, you'll be able to devote yourself to living in a straightforward, clear manner as an example to your children, instructing them in the way they should go without equivocating. I repeat, the philosopher Diogenes was eating bread and lentils for supper.</p><p>He was seen by the philosopher Aristippus, who lived comfortably by flattering the king. Said Aristippus, "If you would learn to be subservient to the king, you would not have to live on lentils."
