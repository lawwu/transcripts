Now, there were two approaches that I took to doing this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=19" target="_blank">00:00:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">and there was kind of like a dumb approach and a more sophisticated approach. The dumb approach,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=29" target="_blank">00:00:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">number one is basically we search on Archive through Python. So, we do a search. This is like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=38" target="_blank">00:00:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">an advanced search that they like to do, and we're basically searching for the category</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=42" target="_blank">00:00:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to be within computer science and computation and language. And we go through and we basically just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=51" target="_blank">00:00:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">get the top 1,000 items from there, and they would be ordered by the date. So, we'd have the most</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=57" target="_blank">00:00:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">recent ones at the top here. And this is fine, but if you want to target a particular field of study</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=65" target="_blank">00:01:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">or something that you're learning at the moment, it's not very good because this is a pretty broad</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=70" target="_blank">00:01:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">scope. So, what I decided to go for is number two, which is, I think, a little bit more sophisticated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">wherein we essentially take one paper that we're interested in. So, we start one paper up here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=87" target="_blank">00:01:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">right? That will have like the archive ID. You can look something like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And what we're going to do is from that, we're going to store it, and then we're going to pass</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=97" target="_blank">00:01:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">it through a large language model, and we're going to ask it to return the references mentioned in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=102" target="_blank">00:01:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the paper, right? But just not all of them because that would be an insane number of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And we're just going to get those. We're going to then perform a Google search to find those papers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">or find the actual IDs of those papers, and then we saw them, right? And then we do the same again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So, it's like a tree. So, we're building this graph of all these papers that are relevant</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">from a particular topic here, which I think kind of emulates what we, or at least what I end up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">doing, which is I read a paper and I don't understand something. So, I go to the bottom,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=138" target="_blank">00:02:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I find where it was, where it came from, go read that paper and probably don't understand something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">again, and just basically keep going through. I go further and further and back until I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">understand something well enough. So, I think that's a pretty natural approach.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So, what I'm going to do very quickly is we'll have a look at number one,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=155" target="_blank">00:02:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, kind of what I did there, but very quickly. And then number two, we'll dive into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot more detail. So, let's go have a look at that. Right. So, this is number one. We're using</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the archive API and you can see here I'm doing a search, right? So, category is CSCL. We're sorting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">by date and we're returning 1,100 results. That is basically the equivalent to going over to archive,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">going to advanced search and then going to all fields, CS.CL and searching.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">That is pretty much what I was doing, but just in Python. So, what you end up getting is all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">these papers. And I don't think these are, maybe they are ordered by the, okay. So, these are also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">already ordered by the most recent items. So, based on that, we'd get all these papers. This</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.120</a></span> | <span class="t">is just like the archive item or paper object that we would get from that. And then we'd get all this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">information. So, authors, categories, the ID, all these other things. And then we'd end up kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">looping through that, getting all this information, putting it into a data frame and we get something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">like this. So, we end up with a summary title and a PDF URL. PDF URL is important, right? Because,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, in this information here, we don't actually have the text of the PDF. We need to go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and get that. So, that's what we would do down here. So, we get the PDF URL. Note I added export</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">onto the end there. Basically, when you are scraping data on archive, they prefer you to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">use them on their mirror sites, which essentially just frees up bandwidth on their main site,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">which is archive.org for actual like real users rather than like robots what we're using here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I'll download the PDF. Then I'll process it with something called PyPDF2 here. Yeah. You just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">open my PDF file and then you'd go through each page and append all the text from each page like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">this. And you get something like this. Now, it's not perfect. There's a few things that could be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">cleaned up, but that was the basic process. So, that was okay, but not very efficient.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So, what we end up going with is the second approach. Now, the second approach, what we do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">is we, for example, we load this paper here. Then we split based on some texts, let's say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.760</a></span> | <span class="t">references. You know, this isn't foolproof, but I didn't see any examples of this being an issue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Actually, there were some cases where they weren't called references, but they're called</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.680</a></span> | <span class="t">like references with all capitals. And I think I fixed that in the later version of this code,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">which we'll come to. But for now, let's have a look at this. So, split on references. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">we get something like this. So, this is getting the end of that. So, like the second part of that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">split. And then you can see that we have all these references, right? Now, the references,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the format of those varies quite a lot. So, I thought maybe you could probably build a regex</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">formula that would kind of cover everything. Probably that is the case. I'm not sure. But I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.840</a></span> | <span class="t">thought, okay, it'd be really cool if we actually use a large language model to extract all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">information we need from these references. So, to do that, we go and use LangChain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We get a prompt template. We're using OpenAI's Text Definition 0.0.3 here. And we couple those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">things together. So, our prompt template followed by the large language model using</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">large language model chain. Right. In here, I've entered my OpenAI API key and set a maximum number</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">of tokens, which I don't want to be too excessive because I just want some references here. It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=379" target="_blank">00:06:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">nothing crazy. And the temperature is set to zero to reduce the amount or the possibility of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=386" target="_blank">00:06:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">model making stuff up. It doesn't stop it from making stuff up, but it means it's less likely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to. And then, you know, we just kind of told the model it's really good at reading or getting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">references from papers. Right. And then we gave a couple of examples because it wasn't actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">doing that well. So, these just a few examples, actually, from the example above, but it works</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=408" target="_blank">00:06:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">on other papers. I tried it. So, we're saying based on, you know, this snippet here, you would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=415" target="_blank">00:06:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">extract this. Right. So, we've got some easy to parse formatting here, which is really important</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=421" target="_blank">00:07:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">for us. And then we say in the references below, there are many papers. Extract their titles,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=425" target="_blank">00:07:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">authors, and years. Right. Which is what we've got here. Titles, authors, and years. Right. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=431" target="_blank">00:07:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">then we feed in the references into there. And then we ask it to extract everything. Right. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=438" target="_blank">00:07:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">we have our prompt template. We created this chain. So, it's going to go. We're going to feed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=442" target="_blank">00:07:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">this prompt into our large language model with some references as per this part here. Now, okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=449" target="_blank">00:07:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">If we go down. So, over here, I was actually, I was just checking how many tokens I should expect</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=455" target="_blank">00:07:35.920</a></span> | <span class="t">within the references page. I basically said I want just about one page of references, nothing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=461" target="_blank">00:07:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">more. So, I found this near the bottom of the page. Probably best if I actually visualize this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=468" target="_blank">00:07:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">a little bit. So, if I open this. Right. So, this is the paper actually looking at. Go all the way</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=477" target="_blank">00:07:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">down to the references. And yes. So, we have the references. So, we're splitting here from the rest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=482" target="_blank">00:08:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">of the paper. And then near the end of this page, we have this. What makes good in context examples</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=489" target="_blank">00:08:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">for GPT-3. That's what we are kind of splitting on here to say this is the first page. Now, we split</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=495" target="_blank">00:08:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">on there. Come to here and we are counting the number of tokens with tick token. This is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=501" target="_blank">00:08:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">tokenizer that OpenAI is using. And this is the one for text, although I should probably check.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=508" target="_blank">00:08:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It might be another one. But anyway, I figured all roughly the same. And we get about 1.5,000</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=516" target="_blank">00:08:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">tokens. So, what we then do is we create this text splitter. It's the token text splitter. And we say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=523" target="_blank">00:08:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">just get the first 1,500 tokens from each reference page. Okay. That's what we're doing here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=530" target="_blank">00:08:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think we actually went a little bit lower than 1.5. Okay. 1,000. I figured that's plenty.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=536" target="_blank">00:08:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. And then from that, we extract the references. So, running on the first one,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=543" target="_blank">00:09:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">we get all of these. And I believe at least most of these are quite accurate. And then we try some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=550" target="_blank">00:09:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">other papers. Okay. So, based on this, let's say, you know, we've got this math QA paper at the top</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=556" target="_blank">00:09:16.640</a></span> | <span class="t">here. Come down here. And what we do is we actually perform a Google search for that paper.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=562" target="_blank">00:09:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? So, we literally just take the title of that paper, math QA towards interpreter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=567" target="_blank">00:09:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we based on those results from Google, we're going to search for one of those results</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=576" target="_blank">00:09:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">that contains this here. All right. So, this is the archive, the paper location. Basically,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=585" target="_blank">00:09:45.520</a></span> | <span class="t">we're searching for that. Anything in various Google results that looks like an archive paper</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=592" target="_blank">00:09:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">link. We go through that and then we extract the ID. Right? And that is what we get here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=600" target="_blank">00:10:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Then we use this to extract another paper. So, we get here. We can click on this, see what we got.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=607" target="_blank">00:10:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. And we got language models, a few short learners. So, come a little bit further down</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=613" target="_blank">00:10:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and then we've just come to here in order to download the actual paper. Right. So, after that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=620" target="_blank">00:10:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I just put everything into a set of functions. Yeah, it needs to go through all that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=625" target="_blank">00:10:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">However, basically, after we've pulled those in different functions, we go paper equals this item</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=634" target="_blank">00:10:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">here. We load the paper and then we say save equals true to basically save the paper to file.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=642" target="_blank">00:10:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Load here is actually so it can do two things. It will look on your local drive and see if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=646" target="_blank">00:10:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">already have the paper downloaded. If not, it's going to go to archive and request the PDF.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=654" target="_blank">00:10:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you can see I've done that for this one. Right. So, I've loaded the paper and then we have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=659" target="_blank">00:10:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">this other function called get meta. Right. And that will basically get all the relevant</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=663" target="_blank">00:11:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">information for you for that particular paper. And it does that. Let me open the code for that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=672" target="_blank">00:11:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So, come down to here. So, this is a more recent version of this code of the archive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=678" target="_blank">00:11:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">object. We go to get meta here. Okay. That's actually where it happens. I think it might be in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=685" target="_blank">00:11:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">load. Okay. Load. And it calls to this self.downloadmeta. Right. You go to that function</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=696" target="_blank">00:11:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and we get to here. Basically, that's calling to the archive API again. You've got your ID. You</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=702" target="_blank">00:11:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">pass it into there. And we just return all the relevant information from that paper. All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=709" target="_blank">00:11:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we have the authors, categories, comment, everything. So, we're just calling to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=713" target="_blank">00:11:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">archive API in order to get that information. Right. So, we end up with all of this. That's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=718" target="_blank">00:11:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">cool. And then after that, we also have the content of the paper, which we got actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=724" target="_blank">00:12:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">when we did this. Same thing as I just showed you. Just download the PDF and extract it all with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=731" target="_blank">00:12:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">pypdf2. After that, we get our references. So, this is actually using the large language model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=739" target="_blank">00:12:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">like I just showed you. I think this is slightly different at this point, but it's basically doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=743" target="_blank">00:12:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the same thing. And we get all of the references in this format here. And this actually gets</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=748" target="_blank">00:12:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">attached to the paper object here so that we can see all the children essentially of that paper,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=755" target="_blank">00:12:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">if that makes sense. I suppose they would be more like the fathers of the paper. But in this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=759" target="_blank">00:12:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">arrangement, we have like the paper and then we have all of its references, which acts as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=764" target="_blank">00:12:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">children within that tree or the knowledge graph. So, after that, I don't know why I repeated it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=772" target="_blank">00:12:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">here. And then we just save that information. Then what we do is we actually go through and we use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=777" target="_blank">00:12:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">this get paper ID. This is the same thing I mentioned before. So, where we are doing a Google</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=782" target="_blank">00:13:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">search in order to get the paper information, you see we have a couple of nones here. That's where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=787" target="_blank">00:13:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I couldn't find anything. So, I don't really worry so much about that. If you can't find a paper</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=793" target="_blank">00:13:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">immediately on Google, it's probably not so important. So, we just ignore those. I'll just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=799" target="_blank">00:13:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">skip them. But for these papers here, just the same as what we did before. So, when we came up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=806" target="_blank">00:13:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">here and we did it, we searched the first paper using this paper archive, so on, so on. We can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=812" target="_blank">00:13:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">actually just do that for all of these other papers as well. So, we basically just create this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=817" target="_blank">00:13:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">big graph of all these different papers. And so, right now, that's kind of formalized to some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=824" target="_blank">00:13:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">degree. Not the best code in the world, but formalized to some degree with this here. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=832" target="_blank">00:13:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">we have this like this. I need to clean up. But we have this archive object, a couple of functions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=838" target="_blank">00:13:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">up here that just kind of help us handle everything, like get the paper ID, initialize our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=844" target="_blank">00:14:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">extractors for extracting references and so on. And based on that, so based on all this code here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=851" target="_blank">00:14:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">which there will be a link to in the description, this is within the constructors file at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=856" target="_blank">00:14:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">moment. I need to rename everything. It's kind of just thrown together at the moment. We actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=862" target="_blank">00:14:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">just process everything. So, everything you just saw is contained here and a few other things are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=867" target="_blank">00:14:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">contained here because I've added a couple of things since then. Okay. So, that's it for this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=873" target="_blank">00:14:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">one. We'll leave it there for now. I hope this has not been too messy and it's at least kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=880" target="_blank">00:14:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">interesting as to how we're handling this data pre-processing thing. And I suppose the most</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=886" target="_blank">00:14:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">interesting bit here is actually extracting those references and using like a search in order to get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=892" target="_blank">00:14:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">other papers that have been referenced within our current paper. At least that was the most</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=897" target="_blank">00:14:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">interesting part for me. So, that being said, we'll leave it there. Thank you very much for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=903" target="_blank">00:15:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">watching. I hope this has been useful in some way and I will see you again in the next one. Bye.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TSnAZAXOo&t=922" target="_blank">00:15:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">you</span></div></div></body></html>
