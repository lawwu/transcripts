With me again, the world's number one podcast. Yes, the world's number one podcast. We came in eighth last week, I think for those of you looking at the iTunes rankings, which is absurd. We've only got to be number eight across all of Apple.</p><p>Something like that. Yeah, whatever their top episodes are on the weekends. Well, that means we crushed on Spotify, then. Probably Yeah, I would guess. I don't I don't know all the rankings, but and and I guess on YouTube, we got labeled with some COVID thing magic. I mean, it's what's going on at YouTube a joke, like literally you're labeling COVID at this point.</p><p>I mean, what a joke. Oh, my lord. So I guess we have to at the top of the show talk about the fundraiser. And I guess this like Vinod Khosla came in hot this week and attacked the besties. Let's play the clip. What is your sense of the shifting winds in the valley around politics?</p><p>I think for a very long time, the valley was seen as sort of a liberal bastion. But you know, if you listen to Elon Musk, or you listen to all in podcast and that gang and others, it seems to be shifting potentially towards former President Trump. Is that just a small pocket?</p><p>Or do you think that that's a real shift in terms of the way the valley's thinking politically? The first thing I would say is all in podcast, and some of the supporters there are not based in the valley. I would say there's a bunch of MAGA extremists in every part of society.</p><p>And I hope we can prevent them from destroying democracy, which is probably the most important issue we face. All right, snacks. Why are you destroying democracy? Now that's a good fit. All right, David. If I know was at the conference, he got a little chippy here. Maybe he got a little bit out of line.</p><p>He's a little bit out of line. What's your take? A little bit a little bit? A little bit? Well, first of all, Vinod should realize we're not MAGA extremists or extremists of any sort, because he's at all in summit last year. He was great. Yeah, we like what he had to say productive.</p><p>I certainly don't dispute his expertise and track record in tech. But in addition to that, then he's saying that we're not based in Silicon Valley. We're not from Silicon Valley. We've all been here for decades. And then he doubled down on that in the tweet. So that's a bizarre statement.</p><p>Maybe he thinks he gets to define people in or out of Silicon Valley. I don't really understand it. But to be frank, this is one of a series of statements that he's made recently that I can only call insulting and childish. First, he had this tweet that he said that Trump supporters were lacking in empathy and caring.</p><p>Then he had another tweet where he said that Trump supporters weren't teaching good values to their kids. This cause Sean McGuire, who's a partner in Sequoia to quote tweet him saying that I think that I'd rather raise my kids to grow up to take after Ivanka Trump than 100 Biden.</p><p>Yeah, and that got like something like 20,000 likes and it was one of those brutal ratios I've ever seen on a tweet. So in any event, I mean, this is just one in a series of partisan tweets. And look, I think you can take whatever position you want on a political candidate.</p><p>I can understand. If he doesn't like Trump, a lot of people don't. He's raising money for Biden. That's fine. doesn't bother me at all. fundraiser like two weeks ago or something. Exactly. That's not an issue at all. But what I do take offense at is labeling millions and millions of ordinary Americans as somehow lacking in empathy, lacking in caring, not being good parents, because you don't like their support for Trump.</p><p>Yeah. And I think that that that is a statement that frankly, reeks of being cocooned in an elite bubble for way too long. And let me just explain, if you look at where Trump support is strongest, it's really in Middle America in sort of the heartland of America of what in between the elite states, basically, the part of America that coastal least dismissively refer to as flyover country.</p><p>Sure. And it's a lot of the industrial Midwest. And frankly, that part of the country has not had the same type of economic experience that we've had in Silicon Valley. Of course, they have not been beneficiaries of globalization, or equities, you know, and they're, they're in the working class and then working class in the factories got gutted.</p><p>Yeah, that's it. Well, yeah, look, if you're in one of the handful of export industries in America, and I'm talking about if you're in Hollywood, or you're in big finance, or you're in software, then globalization has been great for you. Because it has created huge global markets for our products.</p><p>However, if you're in an industry that has to compete with global exports, then it's been very bad with you. And blue collar workers have been hurt, labor has been hurt, people who work with their hands have been hurt. They have not benefited in the same way from the system that we've had in this country for the last 30 years.</p><p>So you can understand why they would not be so enchanted with elite thinking. And I think to then label those people as lacking and caring or empathy or not being good parents, because they haven't had they haven't had the same economic ride that you've had for the last 30 years.</p><p>And then you it's a blind spot. You are the one who is fighting a legal battle to kick some of those people the public the surfers, kick the public off of the public beach in front of your beach house. And then you're saying they're the ones lacking in empathy.</p><p>Dude, look in the mirror. Yeah, I mean, listen, the great irony of this is, as you know, the Democrats were supposed to be the the party of the working people and Biden was supposed to be the pinnacle of that, like fighting for unions fighting for the working person. And so they've just lost that whole thing.</p><p>And I'll say like, it feels like a lot of people are tilted, because they defeated Trump, and now he's back. And so that tilts a lot of people like there was a lot of effort, a lot of energy, and a feeling of success, that Trump was ousted. And the fact that the guy is now the front runner to be president again, can be very tilting after feeling like you've already won the battle.</p><p>And guess what, it's back. I will also defend Vinod real quick. I'll say, having known Vinod for a long time, he's an investor with me. He's a guy I've come to appreciate and think highly of. We had him at the summit. He was great at the summit. It was great.</p><p>This was awesome. If you listen to his thing, he said, the listeners of the pod, and then he said, MAGA extremist, so they're not based in Silicon Valley. I think he was referencing that the listeners of the pod are not based in Silicon Valley, and they are mad. Yeah, I couldn't hear.</p><p>I think what he meant to say was, and some of the supporters there are not based in Silicon Valley, meaning like the supporters, to mouth your thoughts on the notes comments. Yeah, I think the notes comments are a microcosm of something that's a little bit bigger than just him, and I think is roughly emblematic of the mainstream media, which is, I think the four of us have found over the course of these last four years doing the podcast, a rhythm, where there's a whole diversity of views.</p><p>We've always respected each other, we've learned from each other. And each of us have taken turns, expressing something that the others have ended up converging on. That's not a holistic statement on every issue, but it has it has happened. And that's a an incredible example of how you should figure things out from first principles, especially things that matter.</p><p>And I think this is the first time and you know, look, David said this a few years ago, he said, sax did that, the course of elections will be driven by podcasts. And I didn't give that a full enough waiting at the moment when he said it. But I think what I'm realizing is it's not necessarily just that podcasts will frame elections, but it's the counterfactual, which is that it fills a vacuum.</p><p>And I think what you're seeing right now are the reactions of people that have thrived in what used to work, which was a traditional media infrastructure that would shape how people were supposed to think. But then all of a sudden, if you can have a platform like this, where people just talk from first principles, respectfully, and then the chips are going to be what it is, you know, people will come to their own conclusions.</p><p>I think that that's what people are reacting to. So I think what the note is reacting to is this sort of discomfort where you see for reasonable, intelligent people all of a sudden talk open mindedly about what's happening in the presidential election. And what you leave out is the planted orthodoxy of what you're supposed to think.</p><p>And that's disconcerting to him. It's just disconcerting and confusing maybe to Sorkin, who I think is a wonderful reporter and a thinker. It's disconcerting Jason to every single media outlet over the last week that's breathlessly been trying to get me or sacks to have an opinion on this. And the reason I've deleted all of these emails is they don't get a chance to frame what we think.</p><p>You can listen to the podcast and know what we think. This is the future of how smart, reasonable, moderate people should make decisions. It is an example. Talking to somebody you disagree with does not make your opinion bastardized. It actually makes your opinion valuable. There are these simple truths to living a productive life that if you want to embrace, you need to find friends that you can trust even on issues when you disagree, you can hear them out.</p><p>So that's what's happening right now. And I think that that's why we all need to sort of stand together and lock in arms and just keep moving forward. It is something really important here that's happening. And I think that's why the media and these opinion makers are losing their minds.</p><p>Freiburg, your thoughts on this. You're friends with Vinod, as you mentioned, and you've always said to me and in our personal discussions that the reason you do this pod is because you really want to set an example of how to have great conversations and learn from each other and, and the tone of what we do here.</p><p>So your thoughts on this, the unfortunate reality in a voting system and election cycle like we're in Vinod went and did a fundraiser, it's public, but he did a fundraiser for Biden a few weeks ago. And he wants to win the election, he wants to make his horse win.</p><p>There's a lot of reasons why I'm sure Vinod has chosen that person to be his horse. And so when you get on the playing field, you got two teams, only one team wins. So you know, everyone pulls out all the stops to win. One of the things that is done is unfortunate, and it over time causes an erosion and a hardening into a kind of polarity between all people, which is that you call the other side, wrong or bad or extreme, the term that he used, which really, I think, personifies the problem is he said their listeners are there are MAGA extremists, extremist being the word, right?</p><p>Magazine needs to make America great again, which I think everybody wants to make America great again, whatever the extremism phrase is used by both parties to describe the points of view of the other side. And what I think is lacking is a reshifting of the perspective to say their views are valid.</p><p>I acknowledge their views, I hear them, I know why they feel that way. I'm understanding where that group of people are coming from. And to have that acknowledgement, unfortunately, softens and weakens your position and ability to go out and win election. And so both sides harden themselves and use terms like this, to try and discredit the other side.</p><p>So it's unfortunate to see, I think we all understand where someone who's trying to win a battle on the field is coming from when they're trying to do this. But I do think that what is deeply lacking in the erosion that's arisen is because we can't say, I hear you, I see the problems.</p><p>I recognize you as people just like us. You have kids, your families. And you have a different point of view on the policies that will work and the individual that will realize those policies. I also think it's important to make sure that we reiterate again, at the sake of being pedantic, the facts, which is this is a nonpartisan show.</p><p>And it is a platform that has showcased and given time to Democrats, and Republicans and independent independents. Yeah. And they've all taken us up on it. So that thought by the note is, at best incomplete, and more appropriately, just stupid and factually wrong. This is a good point. Larry Summers spoke at the same conference that the note Larry Summers, Dean Phillips, Bobby Kennedy, Chris Christie, I mean, this is a spectrum of people that we are bringing on.</p><p>Again, Cheryl, Sam, you can hear from Jared Kushner, Jared Kushner, you can hear from them in an unfiltered way and come to your own conclusion. That's why we were number eight last week. That's the exact reason why. And I think that that's very scary. Because instead of power brokers, being able to filter an opinion, you now have an opportunity to just hear it for yourself, discuss it amongst your friends and come to your own conclusion.</p><p>So we have always been bipartisan here. And we will continue to be bipartisan. The second thing is, and I just want to say this again, I have asked the White House for President Biden to come on the show. Oh, come on the show, please. Yeah. Yeah, we've offered the exact same thing.</p><p>We are just we are just waiting. People really don't want me to be friends with you guys. They want me to end my friendship with you tomorrow. They want me to end my friendship with you sacks like, like, and these are people who are our mutuals, I just want to say, and I want to just tell them all equally to go fuck themselves here.</p><p>You can believe out the F word. Like I'm not picking my friends based on their political parties or their leanings or who they're supporting for president. The way I look at this sacks is at this point, we're all Americans. We're in this together. America survive survive Trump's presidency, America is going to survive Biden's presidency, the democratic process, it is very messy.</p><p>Everybody gets to have a voice. And let's just pause for a second here and open up the aperture. Let's be thankful that everybody gets to have a say. Let's keep it from getting personal. Half the humans on this planet Earth do not have a voice. The one thing that's trending in the wrong direction globally is people living in a democracy.</p><p>It's the one thing not getting better. We have a lot of work to do in this country. We have to respect each other like we try to do here on this podcast. And we have to talk about the important issues. We all agree the budget's out of control. We all agree the education system sucks.</p><p>We live in a multipolar world. We have to figure that out. When we should go to war when we shouldn't, when we need to stay out of things. These are complicated issues. And name calling and this presidency is not as important as tackling these issues together as Americans. I hope everybody can keep that in mind.</p><p>So let's debate this. May the best candidate win. And then let's move on and solve some problems here. Okay, and it's getting very personal. Yeah. Well said really well said. I know I'm really hurt by this because I tell you personally, it's very hurtful to me because I value our friendships and they're picking on the wrong guy because you're the most loyal guy.</p><p>And so it's kind of like it's going to be the least effective because you don't care what they think Jake, that's the problem. So they can get to you. You can ask me if I do that. Don't tell me what I think sex you can ask me. Okay. I actually care about the two of you bigger like brothers.</p><p>No, we do. But I know I just have to retrain sacks that he can't tell me what I think. Yeah, no, because you do that. You put words in my mouth for all listeners. I just want you to know they've been bickering like this for 20 years. So it's yeah.</p><p>No, here's the point. Here's the point. It happens even worse offline. We're not offline. It's unbelievable. Stop. You're ruining it. Jake out. You're just running right now. Here's the thing. I respect, you know, all of my friends and I like having a diversity of opinions that makes life more interesting for me.</p><p>And then to tell me I can't be friends with this person, that person, the way I grew up, my dad had a bar, Hells Angels, cops, firefighters, just everybody was allowed to come and hang out at the bar. Like we're here. We're having a discourse. Everybody's welcome for a seat at the table.</p><p>You don't LGBTQ, but they all of them the entire rainbow. What people haven't figured out yet is like cancel culture is over. virtue signaling is over. Absolutely. de is over. It's off trend, not on trend. And the people who are still tweeting these blanket statements, and they're trying to demonize the entire other side with unfactual, unfounded potshots are just making fools of themselves.</p><p>And you can see that in there. You can see that in the reaction on x. All right, let's move on. And we have some breaking news here. Oh, no, just to put things on a happier note. What happened? Did Uber get bought by Tesla just launched the Tesla mezcal?</p><p>Oh, breaking news story. Hold on. It's a breaking news story. Tesla has launched mezcal. In that beautiful lightning bottle. I just ordered my bottle of this like seconds ago while we're doing the show. Because this sold out in like two hours before and now the the bottles of the original Tesla tequila go for like $2,000.</p><p>Now, okay, breaking news. Get yours. Get yours. Now if it's still smoking mezcal. There you go. Wait a second. Is this going to compete with the all in a little bit? Well, sold out by the time we launch our ball. Both can be sold out. We're both going to be selling that everybody can see that everybody can win.</p><p>It's not a zero sum game. Everybody can secure the bag. All right, let's get into the docket enough of the self referential influencers. Now did you guys see my deck this month? We're all influencers. We're all influencers. Absolutely. Absolutely. There's a lot of federal regulation going on around AI as we know, regulatory capture.</p><p>Shout out to our guy Bill Gurley, who did a great talk last year about this. On Wednesday, the New York Times reported that the DOJ and the FTC had struck a deal on how to go after AI incumbents. Here's the terms of the deal. And again, this is all breaking.</p><p>The DOJ gets to investigate whether NVIDIA violated antitrust laws, they didn't specify what they're going after here. But it could include the NVIDIA use of CUDA software to lock customers into using their GPUs, or maybe how NVIDIA distributes their GPUs to customers. There's a lot of regulation around that.</p><p>And the FTC takes the lead on looking into open AI's conduct and Microsoft's AI deals. Obviously, there's been a ton of those, including acquirers, etc. And then just this morning, the Wall Street Journal reported that the FTC had opened a probe into Microsoft's deal with inflection AI. That's the one if you remember, where they bought the staff and then did some fakaka crazy commerce deal where they give them a bunch of money, I guess, to bail out the investors.</p><p>And that one is as conflicted up and down as you could possibly imagine. They know Microsoft structured that deal in a way that could avoid regulatory scrutiny. You heard that here first. Actually, we talked about this concept of a shadow acquirer on this very program when we saw it because we'd never seen a deal like that.</p><p>It had includes that $650 million licensing fee. All right, there's tons of other angles here. But let's start with you, Chamath, what are your thoughts on this regulatory capture and NVIDIA's ascension? For those of you not watching, it's almost become the largest market cap company in tech. Actually, today, NVIDIA passed Apple for a moment in time.</p><p>So this is pretty crazy what we've seen with NVIDIA. And here we got regulatory capture coming in hot. Chamath, your thoughts? I have two thoughts. They're sort of mixed emotions. The first is, I think the DOJ and the FTC are totally way out of their ski tips on this.</p><p>This is a totally nascent industry. We don't have any good examples of end user use cases, either at the enterprise or amongst consumers. We only have 18 months of spend history. It is true that we've spent probably 750 billion to a trillion dollars collectively now, yep, on things with the AI label.</p><p>But it is also true that that's probably generated less than $10 billion in revenue. So I don't see what they're exactly investigating in an extremely immature market where we haven't yet seen one cycle of boom and bust, so that we know what we're actually dealing with. So it's way too premature.</p><p>And it's just people afraid and tilting at windmills. The second part, the part that's mixed, though, is we are seeing a clever form of deal making that these huge hyperscalers are doing to work around the traditional constraints that you've had on businesses. Jason, you and I worked at AOL in a moment where AOL paid a very dear cost for essentially round tripping revenue.</p><p>Yep. Microsoft had to go through a huge DOJ inquiry and a settlement decree. And they were in the penalty box for most of Steve Ballmer's tenure as a CEO, a lost decade. And the handcuffs came off when Satya took over that business. So I think what I'm trying to say is folks have become extremely sophisticated at replacing round tripping with these complicated tack 2.0, whatever you want to call it credit oriented deals.</p><p>They'll finance you to buy their own chips. All of this stuff has to be scrutinized a little bit more. So that part I support. But all of a sudden, launching an antitrust investigation makes no sense. So I really think the inquiry should be coming from the SEC about is this real revenue.</p><p>That's actually the key issue. And this goes to Chamath, what we talked about, like, let's, if we're going to police something tactics, make sense, not competition, which has been Lena Khan's sort of approach to this, and she's only going to be in the position for another couple months, but the election goes the way it's going.</p><p>So this might all be moot. Freeberg, I want to get your thoughts on this. We had that great talk 2851 miles from from bill, and regulatory capture at the summit, you can look, it would be in the show notes. If you haven't seen it. It's great talk for your thoughts on this.</p><p>I don't know what regulatory capture Nvidia, are you talking about regulatory capture of Nvidia, just regulatory capture in the framing of AI? Is it too early? Hey, we're like, in the we're not even in the first ending here. And already, we're going to start investigating everybody. And it just seems pretty sure one of the silly aspects is they just passed this law in California, Newsom warns against perils of over regulating AI.</p><p>Oh, good. Governor Newsom warned on Wednesday against stifling the burgeoning AI sector. I mean, Newsom is well informed by the tech community. So sure, I don't think he and he's also an intelligent person. So I don't think he'd kind of, you know, fall quickly in line on this one.</p><p>But the way that the statutes were written, is there's a definition on the size of a model, which in and of itself is very quickly changing. As we know, we've seen recently significant reductions in model size, that actually improve performance overall of the model for specific applications. And it's very likely we end up seeing a lot of more smaller targeted models being used in specific applications, instead of one massive general purpose model being used, or networks of smaller models, which is what really where I think the industry is going.</p><p>And if that's where things go, then this, this statute doesn't even matter, it makes no sense anymore. And that shows you, I think, how quickly things are changing. They go and they get a quote, experts opinions. In a couple of months, those experts come back, they're like, here's the size of a model that you need to be regulating.</p><p>And then the legislators run, and they write the code, they pass the statute. And all of a sudden, it doesn't even make sense anymore. So yes, I don't think we really know where this technology is all falling out at this point. And I think it's very difficult to have the government kind of reach in too quickly to try and identify what they should and shouldn't be allowing to happen from a free market perspective.</p><p>Your thoughts, David Sachs, especially in light of the fact that looking like we're going to have some regime change in Washington, and the FTC is going to going to going to turn over, obviously, if that happens. Well, look, I agree with you guys, this is just too soon to be opening these investigations.</p><p>It's true that OpenAI and Nvidia have leads in their respective markets, but that's all it is at this point. It's way too early in the development of these markets to say that these are clearly monopolists. There's still a lot of competition going on. If a few years from now, Nvidia still has whatever 85 90% market share and no one's even close to catching up, then maybe you consider it a monopolist.</p><p>Same thing with OpenAI. But it just seems very early to be rushing into investigations of these companies. I mean, the AI market is what 18 months old to two years old, maybe at most, I'd say two is a good way to look at it. Yeah. So it's just very early to be doing this.</p><p>Look, I think this is of a piece with remember that executive order or whatever that remember when the White House issued that 100 page plus executive order on AI regulation, we covered it on the show. And we also thought that was too soon. And we thought that if the internet had been regulated in that way, in you know, circuit 1995 or 1997, it never would have blossomed the way that it did.</p><p>You know, you want to give these markets some time to play out before you bring that down the heavy hand of regulation on them. So it just seems to me like the administration is getting carried away here with this desire to regulate this new space. And I mean, frankly, it's of a piece with you, I would say an innovation, a hostile agenda, you also have the attacks on crypto, you just had buying veto a bill that would have finally given crypto regulatory framework in the US, it passed with 60 votes in the Senate, including Democrats like Chuck Schumer.</p><p>And it still wasn't good enough. And oh, and it was based on a framework. I think that came from the SEC. Yeah. But Biden is basically in the Elizabeth Warren camp that he's going to give no quarter to crypto. So you've got hostility to AI, you've got hostility to crypto, you've got hostility to M&A, no one can get an M&A deal through right now, you put all these things together.</p><p>Plus, you've got hostility to options as compensation in terms of the 25% unrealized gains tax. You add up all these things. And again, I think this is an agenda that does not benefit Silicon Valley at all. Well, and if you want to understand why people are coming to your fundraiser tonight, if you put all this together, it doesn't take a genius to figure out that if you're a venture capitalist or an entrepreneur, and you want to see M&A, and you want to see entrepreneurship, and you want to see your companies thrive, you want to see your employees get rich and have options.</p><p>Biden is basically handing the election to Trump. It's like he's doing everything he can to basically alienate Silicon Valley. So capitalism, you're exactly right. And innovation. I wouldn't even say it's Silicon Valley. It's like if you're going to go and build things that are at the bleeding edge, you know, the government used to be the most critical supporter of that.</p><p>Right? If you think about space or defense, these are areas, the internet itself, the government was the partner of private industry to make sure that there was no regulation. And that like really, really exact looking innovation could happen. That's should be their role. And this speaks to this decel versus acceleration movement that we see here in Silicon Valley.</p><p>And this is what we see in Texas, Florida, UAE, Riyadh, Doha, there are places in the world, Singapore, where people are accelerating innovation. And this is what humans want, not just entrepreneurs, not just venture capitals, all of us want to see an acceleration of innovation. Everybody wants to see prosperity.</p><p>And if you put yourself up as the D cell candidate, we're not going to allow M&A, we're going to screw with options, we're going to do all this stuff, people just not going to vote for you. And people want crypto legal. So take the memo. I mean, this, I mean, the fact that Democrats can't feel the candidate that aligns with the what humanity wants, is absolutely mindboggling.</p><p>This is why I think Biden's getting hot swap this month. You heard it first. He's got I know, Gavin is going to be running for president, it's going to be Trump and Gavin, they're swapping Biden. After this first debate, Biden is going to get demolished by Trump in the debate.</p><p>It's going to be elder abuse. He's getting wiped out and hot swapped. You heard it here first. Well, there's a lot of a lot of conspiracy theorists online who agree with you a lot of tit for tat speculation that I'm gonna get switcheroo hot swap. But look, I mean, I think you make the correct point, which is, you know, I don't really think about it this way.</p><p>But you're right, Biden is the D cell candidate. And nobody wants that. Also, Trump has shown a learning curve where he recently has been saying positive things about crypto. Yeah. And he's always, I think, been more pro economic growth. He was a real estate developer from the private sector, he actually understands the economy.</p><p>So there's no question that he would be more pro innovation, much more pro innovation than Biden. And to your point about this is one of the reasons why people are coming to the fundraiser. I had someone from the campaign said something very interesting to me. She said that we've never seen this many new donors.</p><p>Yeah, at an event before. So we're turning out the new donors for this reason. Yes. And you know, we're not going to be intimidated by people calling us names. You know, it's like, look, in any normal election, people in an industry would vote for the candidate who they see as most aligned.</p><p>Yes. With what is good for them, their families, their industry made a list. Let's just make the list here right now. Make the list of things Trump is in support of, right. And Republicans are in support of right now. They're going to be pro M&A, they're going to be pro crypto, they're going to be pro less taxes, they're going to be pro law and order.</p><p>You know what, that's where I align. Those are the things I want. So if you just list the issues for me, despite how I might feel about Trump and some of the things he's done, he checks off all my boxes, he checks off all my boxes. And I think that's what's happening here.</p><p>And, you know, people were scared to come out and say this person checks off all my boxes. The Democrats need to realize they're out of sync with America. They're out of sync with powerful people in America, especially the donor base. They're the D cell candidate party now. And they just have to flip this thinking they're going to get demolished.</p><p>It is going to be a landslide at this point. People want jobs and prosperity from your lips to God's ears. Do the hot swap. I mean, I don't really have a lot more to say. Yeah, yeah. Take the win. And crypto is such an obvious win. And you know what, Trump's anti EV right now he's been wailing on EVs.</p><p>I guarantee you that's the next thing. I bet you next week he comes out next week. Within the next two weeks. Here's my prediction. Trump says you know what, EV is not so bad. Remember he's been saying EVs nobody wants these things we're subsidizing. I bet you next week or maybe in 30 days I'm making a prediction here.</p><p>You bank the prediction in 30 days Trump comes out magically in support of EVs. Well, I think that his point is that people shouldn't be forced to buy EVs. Right? I mean, I don't think he's against them per se. I think he's against people being forced. I think that what the new administration hopefully, or what Trump should propose is effectively a modus vivendi with big tech, where the point is that if you stop censoring our people, if you stop censoring conservatives, if you restore the civil liberties of the average American to say what they want online to basically bank online, to stop essentially de platforming and censoring people, then we will let you innovate, we'll let you do M&A, we'll let you get back to business.</p><p>That basically is the basis for a peace agreement between big tech and the Republican Party. Yeah. And by the way, I'd say in the next 30 to 60 days, you're gonna see 10 incredibly high profile people come out and support of Trump if Biden isn't swapped out. And when I say high profile, I have the inside line on this extremely high profile people, not just Doug Leonie, not just David Sachs, it's not by up to you.</p><p>It is going to be about 10 high profile people who are much higher profile respectfully than Chamath and Sachs, and Doug Leonie. So just wait for it, folks. You cannot be a decelerous in, you know, this world. Let's keep moving. Roaring Kitty, aka Keith Gill, just disclosed a nine figure position in GameStop.</p><p>Yes, we're back to where this podcast started. We're talking about GameStop and as crazy as it is, and a E trade is considering suspending his account. This is going to take a little bit of background. I apologize here. The D platforming him. Here we go again. Quick background. You remember the first basically viral moment for this podcast is AI moment.</p><p>I remember I was in Tahoe skiing was the GameStop saga back in 2021. 1000s of retail investors following this individual Keith Gill. We're posting in this subreddit called Wall Street bats if you're not familiar, and they created a massive short squeeze and they sent the stock flying Robin Hood halted the trading member flag came on that one all went crazy.</p><p>We covered that all. And then Keith Gill went silent for the past three years on Twitter and Reddit. He said nothing. Then on May 12, he posted this meme on x, which has been viewed 28 million times. Now, if you don't know this meme, this is the lean forward mean when you've got a game controller in your hand, it is a way to signal like, hey, we're getting to the boss level, it's gonna get exciting.</p><p>Here's your GameStop chart, folks. You see that first peak, that's when we reported on it back in 2021. And here we go again, it just had a slow ride down for three years and bink popped up again. So GameStop stock tripled at the posting of that meme. Why is this important?</p><p>Well, he has a huge position, he increased it from 200,000 shares, basically to 5 million had 120,000 call options tomorrow. We'll comment on all this in a moment. If he exercised all these calls, still could own an additional 12 million shares. Here's Gary Gensler, who was on CNBC Wednesday trying to like, calm the markets down and or try to get control of this craziness.</p><p>Here's the clip. I say to you look, I want to put up a I want to put up a cryptogram. And it's of a chair leaning up, which we know from video game playing means come on, this is the ninth inning, get ready. And we know that I'm a person who happens to like the stock of GameStop.</p><p>This is the single Come on, get ready. Is this something hypothetically that is that the SEC should worry about? Look, again, it's not so hypothetical, because you're describing things that are in the public domain and in the public is, is, you know, interested in. So but generally speaking, you have to make sure that you don't mislead the public, and that you don't in any way, do things in the markets that may be manipulative or misleading.</p><p>And so that's the key thing in our capital market. The key thing is, if you can cure it with disclosure, this is Brandeis, you know, if they disclose that this is something that they call action, then you can't go after them. Disclosure is one really key part of our capital markets.</p><p>When you buy the stock of a company, you expect that they give you full and fair disclosure. That's, by the way, not what you're getting right now in this crypto field. So I just, you know, cautionary tale there, that disclosure, but disclosure doesn't necessarily protect a bad actor, if they're manipulating a market, Shama, you've been you've had a lot of comments on the markets and specifically this one over the years.</p><p>What are your thoughts is posting this meme, stock manipulation or disclosure? No, it's he's posting a meme. Okay, thank you. He put a picture on the internet. Okay. I mean, that again, this is like the problem that we have, which is that he disclosed his position in a different way.</p><p>Now, we don't know whether that disclosure is accurate, because I think it was just a screenshot of like some statement inside of a Reddit thread, right? And then that got posted many times elsewhere. Is this accurate? I don't know. Because he has no obligation as an individual to do any of this stuff.</p><p>Because he's not running a hedge fund, and he's not running other people's money. Now, if he was acting in concert with other people, you could say, Hey, hold on a second, if you're repping not just your money, but other people's money, and you did this, then there's probably a disclosure obligation there.</p><p>But at the end of the day, this is a guy that acted and basically created hype. And right now, the SEC does not have a framework to deal with that, because the rules that existed didn't understand social media and whatnot. And he's also not a regulated entity. He's just an individual.</p><p>Now, if it turns out that he was selling while he was posting this stuff and trying to manipulate the market in some way, obviously, they could find issue with that. But just for him being a credible influencer, and creating momentum for an underlying position, that in and of itself is not illegal.</p><p>Sacks, I think we have to go to judge sacks here. Judge sacks. What is your verdict? Our meme stock manipulation? Judge sacks? No, I don't see any manipulation there. Like Jamal studies is posting a meme. What you saw? Not guilty. What I see in that clip is Jim Cramer trying to stir up an SEC investigation of Keith Gill.</p><p>For what? I mean, what exactly is he done here? This is kind of the Wall Street Journal as well. If you look at the Wall Street Journal today, there's an entire article basically with the headline is what Keith Gill is doing illegal. And I think you can view this in a different lens, which is, here is an individual that is totally outside of the establishment that however he's done it, has gotten a hold of hundreds of millions of dollars, maybe even now billions if the stock keeps going.</p><p>And I think that that for the establishment that controls those pipes, very disconcerting. Right? If he if he was one of those apex predators on Wall Street, if he was one of those major hedge funds that donates a lot of money to the political elite, in other words, if he was a well connected political player, I doubt anyone would be asking these questions.</p><p>For you got thoughts on this market manipulation or meme stonk, fun, good times, you're buying GameStop, you're paying EMC, like you buyer beware, you're you're in on the joke. What are your thoughts? Nick, can you pull up the image? I'm going to talk about the stupidity of buying the stock in this company.</p><p>This is a company. And then I think we can talk about whether that's even relevant, which I think indication is that it's not. GameStop finished the year 2023 fiscal year, with sales of 5.3 billion, down from 5.9 billion the year before. So sales declined by 12% in the year, adjusted $1 billion in revenue selling games, adjusted EBITDA for the year was $65 million.</p><p>And they have about 1.2 billion in cash. Currently, as of today, the market cap is about 13 and a half billion dollars. So that makes it about a 12 and a half billion dollar enterprise value 12 and a half billion divided by 65 million of EBITDA means that this stock is currently trading at about 192 times EBITDA.</p><p>A business that is profitable and you can say that the profits are stable and predictable and is likely not going to grow very much will typically trade for seven to 12 times EBITDA. And this stock is trading at 192 times EBITDA and the revenue is declining 12% a year.</p><p>So I'll just point out like, I don't think that there's anything about the actual performance of the underlying business and the security that you are buying or selling when you are making a decision about whether or not to buy or sell the security. And I think that that's the real question.</p><p>It does that even matter? Clearly, it doesn't. Let people have fun, let them go to Vegas, let them play in the roulette table, they know what they're getting into the disclosures are all there. All the SEC filings are there, all the financials of this business are there, what you're actually buying is publicly viewable, you can look at it, you can make an investment decision as an individual investor and trader, and you want to blow your money, trying to see when the social trends are going to shift one way or another.</p><p>Let it be your decision. I think this is well said. If you're buying NFTs, if you're buying stonks like this, if you're playing poker in a, if you're playing bomb pots, look it up, folks, if you don't know what bomb pots are, and you're going crazy playing bomb pots for eight hours, like we did the other week, you're there to gamble.</p><p>If you are playing bomb bots, this is the bomb pots of the stock market, have fun, go crazy. If you're buying NFTs, if you're buying crypto, and you know what you're getting into, there's no law, there's no law that defines why you should or should not buy a security with respect to the diligence you have individually done to determine whether the underlying business is worth the price you're paying.</p><p>Yes, the law says that the businesses that are listing their securities for public trading have an obligation to make disclosures on their financials, and any other material events to the public. And they do that through the SEC filing process. That's all out there. And then what you as an individual do with it is up to you.</p><p>Enough with the nanny state. Go ahead, sex. So when's the right time to put a short on this company? The stock is up 40% today. And then there's these reports that came out yesterday on a bunch of very big hedge funds that put very big short positions yesterday on the stock and it's up 40% today.</p><p>Here we go to get margin call. So this is where you see the same thing that happened last time where what was that guy's name? The the capital? Melvin Melvin. Get out on the wrong side of this, you're gonna get plotkins. Don't get plotkin in a sour moochie. Yeah, that's what you don't want to do.</p><p>Because you could lose it all in a sacra moochie or it's basically a game where, you know, the Redditors are they bid up? They bid up the stock? Yes, to levels that realistically, it's not worth that much disconnect. It's a big, it basically creates a short squeeze. So the stock flies up.</p><p>Yeah. Then the hedge funds know it's overvalued. So they basically put new shorts on. Yeah. And then they do the next short squeeze. And they'll do something that's even more dangerous, which is they can get synthetically short. So they'll, they'll add leverage to this, using all kinds of esoteric derivatives that other banks on Wall Street will happily sell them.</p><p>And then when those are disclosed, then the Redditors can just pump it even more, which causes massive margin call. So I think that I think the thing that Friedberg you're saying, though, this is this existential thing that comes back, it's happened in NF T's, it's happened in the dotcom bubble, it happened in SPACs, it's happened in crypto.</p><p>Are we supposed to protect people? And then the question is, who is the we? And are you supposed to say, if you're an adult, and you can read, then read the disclosures, and you're on your own. That's what the SEC says. Yeah, and that's what the rule of law has been.</p><p>And so this is going to be an interesting test, because instead of an organization, it's going to be a person in this case, Keith Gill, who will be the face of what happens to the stock, because if a bunch of people all of a sudden, plow into this thing, and then it goes to five, it'll be really interesting to see the reaction, hey, you should have saved us, how could this happen?</p><p>You know, he dumped this on all of us. And the answer is no, he did not. Where was the government to save our day? Where's the government to protect consumers? That's not with the nanny state. That's the next cycle of the story. The next cycle of the story is no, the government.</p><p>Yeah. And you showed how the government protected everybody, which was you showed the revenue, and the profits and the margins, which is publicly available. And you did it in two minutes. I mean, anybody, anybody can look at your analysis and see, you didn't even use a sophisticated model, you use probably the calculator app on your frickin Mac to figure out that it was 192.</p><p>No, no, I'm sure he used the calculator app. So you actually have the SEO. The whole point is, you can figure out that there's no logical justification for this company using one Google search and the calculator app on your Mac. Yeah. It's on you. I think the question is, should we make all sports betting legal and all online casinos legal?</p><p>So if you follow this to its natural conclusion, let people do what they want. Why are all of the other gambling industries so tightly regulated? I think there's a difference. Well, because we need a stock market, we need we need the ability for companies to go public. It just so happens that you can get this weird effect where some stocks can become meme stocks.</p><p>But that doesn't mean you want to design the entire system of securities laws around one or two meme stocks. The fact of the matter is that investors are sufficiently protected by robust disclosure requirements that apparently GameStop has followed. All that information is out there. You basically dismantled the company in like two minutes.</p><p>So anyone watching this show has all the information they need not to buy this stock at 190 times earnings, okay, if they choose to follow that information. The other thing that you're saying, which is really important is you have to remember what the capital markets and the stock market is therefore it's not meant for this.</p><p>This is a small little cul de sac. But the overwhelming majority of the capital markets and the equity markets is to allocate excess capital to good ideas. That's what is usually happening. There's a bunch of us that will put a bunch of our money into things because we think it's the right thing to do.</p><p>And that is the overwhelming majority of what is happening in the stock market every day. And David's right every now and then one of these things randomly comes up. And every period of time, there'll be a few parts of the market that go crazy. But the reality is that's not what the overwhelming majority of the actions and that's not why the security solution.</p><p>Have you guys seen this guy? His name is Tim Nackey on Instagram. So what this guy did, this guy's incredible. So this guy went out. And he basically bet 10 cents and online blackjack because he's legally allowed to do it where he lives. I think he's in Australia or something.</p><p>Oh, yeah, that's 10 cents for every follower he has on Instagram. So over the last couple of months, he's been right. Yeah, he's been racking and racking up the bets. And he ended up doing these $100,000 plus bets because he got over a million followers. He ran this thing up to over a million bucks and he quit.</p><p>But it's it's now he's formed like a blackjack syndicate. So everyone wants to kind of pile in and bet with him. I think that there's this really interesting phenomenon of like social betting. Everyone wants to be in a group together. He's got hundreds of 1000s of people that have put money in this is so great.</p><p>And then he goes and does this online gambling. Nick pulled the video up. I just say you watch how this guy and he's so entertaining. He's awesome. Oh, man. This is this could be deadly for sacks. sacks didn't know about this. blackjack and betting 10 cents for every Instagram follower.</p><p>I've got there are 940,000 of your weapons with us now. So a $94,000 bet coming right up. Alrighty, ladies and gentlemen, we have a $94,000 on the line for the 940,000 of your weapons with us 90 on the button. Okay, each of the side bits this bloke definitely gloves up both hands on the golf course never has such an impact on my life.</p><p>I'm not healthy for gross seven versus six. There might be a double down. There might be doubling down. I'll take three. That's a double down. Double down. Yeah, yeah, definitely double down. God damn you go change for me here. Of course we're counting cars again. I will see you tomorrow you smug son.</p><p>Oh my god. This is so great. This guy is so good. sacks. Do you know about this? That's some serious degeneracy. It looks so fun, though. There's only one a day. Oh my god. And every day his follower count goes up. So every day he bets more. And then you're following he ran this thing up to a million a profit.</p><p>Oh, so good. I haven't seen sacks this awake during the pod. You don't get the 10 cents. He keeps it from so he started this just by betting his own money. And he would put 10 cents down every day for how many followers he had. Okay, he he started betting more and more of his own money.</p><p>account that he can but I'm saying is it still all of his money that he's betting? So then as of a few weeks ago, or like a two weeks ago, he stopped betting his own money. He took the million off the table. He called it a day and he set up a syndicate.</p><p>And now people send their own money in and he's betting the syndicates money. And he does one hand a day and he keeps racking this thing up. It's just but what happens when he loses? Is there a day where he's lost a lot of money? Oh, dude, you gotta watch it.</p><p>Man. It's so I want to see what happens when he loses like this is great. Can we hit the sky at the all in summit online blackjack? Right. So there's always like a fake dealer. And he has all this hilarious commentary. Let's set up an account right now. I'll be honest with you.</p><p>This may get me back on Instagram. This is so juicy. Ah, we should get this guy out to the summit. This guy's got to come to the summit and do a live hand with Mr. He's big, big shout out. Is he on tiktok or no just I think he only does Insta.</p><p>Yeah, Tim Knack. I haven't seen sacks listen to Freeberg on this podcast more than he just did. That was incredible. You got sacks his attention. sacks. Did you know you could play live online blackjack from your phone? You know this tonight? Did I know that? This is important information for all of us.</p><p>Big day coming up. There is 514,000 of you in email and a $51,400 bid coming up. All right, day 60 a monumental day. We can hit the 50k button here. We will do $50,000. $800 on the 21 plus three $600 on the perfect peers. This is by far and away the biggest bet I have put on a table in my life.</p><p>We're trying to itch ourselves into gambling immortality. 14 plays three. No. Oh, it's a disgusting pull on day 60 with all the marbles on the line. We will stand and look for 10 10 and bust 10 10 and bust. 10 10 and bust. Come on. 10 10 10 heroics to be a hero.</p><p>Yes. Yes. Yes. Day 60. Stick that in your pipe. Holy. Oh my god. We've broken the push streak with the adventures of 10 10. And you better believe that means I'll see you tomorrow. And I'll be betting even more. This guy's got great energy. Can he do one live on the show next week?</p><p>Oh, day 55. Oh, here we go. Instagram follower I've got outrageously. There is an extra 21,000 of you in here today. So $37,600 bit going on for the 376,000 of you legends in here now. Coming right up. Okay. Day 55 brings about a big I don't like this deal.</p><p>We have $36,000 on the button 1000. And $600 on the perfect peers that D 7.6 k total bits are closed. We've just had a goddamn dealer change. We've been duped here. I'm cool. I'm cool. plays a 12 v king. Oh my god before I before I hit the hit button.</p><p>I will say this having talked to the morning rumble this morning. Last time I spoke to the media about this journey. I broke a six day winning streak that day and I lost so if it happens again today, this one's on Roger Farrelly. We need to see eight or nine go low.</p><p>No. Oh my god. Come on that dealer change was so good. I guess you just can't win them all. But we've been and I will see you tomorrow. When we'll be bidding even more that dealer change was so dirty. You saw the dealer change at the last minute he came up and they changed the dealer.</p><p>They asked me before I've been with you and they do that every time with you start running it up. They send in the dealer to ice you. I think there's a particular dealer they've got. You know, they do. It's like in the bullpen. The blank cooler. Yeah, we know the one the black cooler.</p><p>I don't want to say anything but it's the cooler. We need this guy next week on the pod to do the live bet and then we each give them 5k. How about that? You guys in I've had them trot out the cooler. When I was playing craps once, I was so mad.</p><p>And I was on such a heater. And what happens is, you guys have seen me play craps where it's like it's all rhythm, right? So it's like, yes, I get the dice in a certain way. Yeah, you know, I do. They bring in this guy. And he was like a clutch.</p><p>It's like Daniel Day Lewis in my left foot. All of a sudden he's everything over for dice fall off the table. I got so out of rhythm. It was so I was so I want this guy in the pod next week. We're each putting five dimes in we got 20k from all in.</p><p>Let's do it. That would be so much. Oh my god, we should get him to play a special all in hand and let him run up our capital on the summit. Let's take the profits from the summit and do a live hand. We could put like a million bucks each on it.</p><p>We double up and then we're done with the pod. We don't have to do a summit next year. Really good idea. Let's do it. Let's let it roll. All right. God, this is so much action for us. I don't know if we can continue but there's more stories to come.</p><p>And just buyer beware. I mean, if you're betting on this stuff, I mean, what do we have to tell you if you're betting on GameStop? We don't have to tell you anything. You're an adult. You're an adult. Go to your own job. Well, here's something really interesting. Seatbelt. Don't drink and drive.</p><p>Don't use drugs. I mean, it's like, all of a sudden, like we need to govern how you're not a functioning adult. By the way, if you swim in Cape Cod alone in the deep water in the kelp, you might get hit by a great white shark. Or do whatever you want.</p><p>And please just take responsibility for yourself. It's not our job. Absolutely. And I'm responsible for my children, not you. Well, I mean, also, it's, I just want to ask one question here. Is there anything with the short selling that could there could be more disclosure on that trim off that just if the SEC was going to do something, I hear that bubble up once in a while, should be more disclosed.</p><p>I really think that's a very good idea. I do think that there are some short sellers who are doing it because they have to hedge a position that they have. But then there are other short sellers who are doing it speculatively. And there are synthetic instruments that banks will sell you to go massively super short.</p><p>That's how you can get a situation where 140% of the stock is sold short, which doesn't shouldn't make sense. If there's only 100 shares of a company, how could it be that 140 shares are sold short, it's because you can have these synthetic expensive static for the audience, because I don't think people know this concept.</p><p>So there are ways where if you have a formal trading relationship with Wall Street, and you need to be of a certain size, and they go through a diligence process, they give you so you know, I have one called an ISDA. And it's essentially an account and a framework that you negotiate with a bank that allows you to call them and say, Hey, give me a B or C.</p><p>And other times they'll call you and say, Hey, I have this really interesting way to play XYZ. And one of the things that you can do with them is you can say, Listen, I want to go super, super long, or super, super short, a theme or a company. And they'll create a contract with between you and them.</p><p>That'll allow you to get that kind of exposure. Now, you're not supposed to do that on a regular basis, nor are you supposed to lever this up. This is actually what blew up a different hedge fund called archaic goes, I remember we covered it. And in that, I guess what happened was, the gentleman was calling many banks and doing all these things.</p><p>And one bank didn't know what the other bank was doing. So all of a sudden, there was this massive synthetic leverage that he was getting on, I think it was news Corp stock. And then they found out that it was unwound, then he owed a bunch of money, he couldn't pay it, the whole thing shut down, the stock market went crazy.</p><p>So so no way that disclosure, but there isn't a rule that says that. And every time somebody tries to introduce it, the broker dealers basically lobby and kill it. So in a way, it's almost like a parallel universe where bets are occurring on outcomes in the stock market that are not tied to the stocks in the stock market.</p><p>Well, it is tied in the sense that ultimately, it all needs to feed back to an actual physical share. So this is where all this price behavior gets further amplified. I think the point is that these forms of expressing risk, yes, can really amplify what would otherwise happen. So when freebirds example, most people would sit there get the financials.</p><p>Some would maybe say historically, this thing looks like a short or I wouldn't even buy it at all, right. But other people may say, Well, if I listened to the chairman, and I think about the future, maybe I go long, that's a, that's a fine thing, you can enter the stock market and do that.</p><p>But all this other stuff amplifies all these things to a degree that we're not really used to. And let's be honest, the people who are betting, I'll use the word betting here, the people who are betting on these things are not looking to get a 7% return or beat the average.</p><p>I mean, they're looking to double their money in 48 hours. They know what they're getting in for, they're just walking up to the roulette table and putting 10k on black or red, and then clapping and seeing five reds in a row and saying, Oh, it's got to be black next.</p><p>I mean, they're Phil Helmy within this. They don't say that when they lose them. No, of course not. Yeah, no, no personal ownership here. Well, here's an interesting thing that's sort of related a little bit of jurisdiction shopping or placing of companies and products continues in Texas is very hot in this regard.</p><p>BlackRock and Citadel are backing new stock, a new stock exchange take on the New York Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ duopoly. So according to the Wall Street Journal, the exchange would be based in Texas and called the Texas Stock Exchange or the TX s e, they've raised 120 million so far, it seems like a low number.</p><p>And the general pitch here is the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ have become expensive, and they've been increasing their compliance costs. NASDAQ has a new board of diversity target that went into effect at the start of this year, all the DEI stuff. And so this exchange is pitching itself as a CEO friendly, and the anti woke exchange.</p><p>So here's the plan timeline file and FCC registration docs later this year start facilitating trades next year, post the first new listing in 2026. Interesting, I guess that Citadel and Black Rock are in this group, because they can bring a lot of business, obviously. And you know, some of this other stuff that's been going on with Texas, Texas is now Tesla's corporate headquarters, they moved to Palo Alto in California, Texas in in 2021.</p><p>Your thoughts here, Chamath on movie love it. Okay, why? Why do you love it so much to tell competition? I do think that it's hard right now for companies to get access to capital. I think more diverse and more flexible ways where smart investors can allocate their money into the ideas that they want are better.</p><p>I think that the duopoly hasn't created enough competition. So the NASDAQ and, and New York Stock Exchange haven't innovated. And in fact, they've, they've probably been a little regressive. In terms of filing requirements, listing requirements in terms of board composition, they've fallen for a bunch of things that don't actually point to the economic rationale or value in a company.</p><p>And so I think if you have a third player, there's a chance that more competition will create more rational behavior, which will flow into the companies themselves. So I'm a huge fan of this. I think that the the stock exchanges right now are too brittle, because and there's and that large reason is because there's only two of them.</p><p>Freeberg, any thoughts for you about more options? Well, I think part of this is actually there's been these rules imposed by NASDAQ and New York Stock Exchange that have tried to enforce upon the listed companies, rules and regulations that are not tied to securities laws, including some of these aspects of diversity of your board.</p><p>And I know that there have been a lot of public company, board members, and CEOs that have quietly tried to push back on these rules, that they're imposing social systems upon, you know, what is effectively a regulated exchange. And so there's certainly like an interest in a pushing for a competitive marketplace for exchanges.</p><p>There was a survey done recently that showed I got to find some of this data, but it showed the cost of going public on NASDAQ, Amex or the New York Stock Exchange was about $7.4 million. Cost of going public through an over the counter bulletin board listing service was about $2 million.</p><p>And then there's these additional kind of rules that are being imposed if you want to be listed on the big boards. So clearly, there's interest and it's great to see a competitive market emerge, you know, how there have, by the way, there have been other attempts. There's that long term stock exchange, you guys remember that a couple years ago, that was incentivized long term holdings.</p><p>There was two other equity security exchanges, efforts made in the last couple of years that didn't take off. So this isn't super novel in terms of like seeing a new challenger exchange step up, but I think more competition is always better. All right. In other news, Apple and OpenAI have reportedly struck an iPhone deal.</p><p>According to Bloomberg, Apple is going to announce a major partnership with OpenAI at WWDC next week chat GPT will be integrated into iOS, which means Apple is outsourcing its AI chatbot at least at the start. I guess you could argue it benefits both sides because OpenAI gets access to over a billion phone users and Apple gets a native integration of a top tier language model.</p><p>Terms are not clear. But most people think this is going to be a short to midterm deal with Apple building out its own AI chatbot in the future, but it's just not ready for primetime right now also plans to make Siri AI powered and bring AI features to the Apple ecosystem.</p><p>You have heard that Apple is going to try to let Siri dive deeper into apps, ie if you're ordering your DoorDash or Uber Eats or an Uber or Lyft or whatever, it might actually be able to execute those things inside of an app. Interesting line from the article, Apple executives were concerned about reputational damage from a rogue chatbot.</p><p>Some people within Apple have a philosophical aversion to having a chatbot at all very interesting. So thoughts on this sacks, just getting you back in the loop here. Well, we kind of predicted that something like this could or should happen. We said that the big win for Apple in AI would be to make Siri actually work based on LLM because Siri just, you know, it's understanding of languages historically has not been great.</p><p>And that's really limited the usefulness of it. Imagine if Siri worked with the conversational abilities of chat GPT 4.0. If it had that level of semantic understanding, if it could talk to you, the way that 4.0 can talk to you, that would make Siri really powerful. And you know, for me, Siri is a feature I've turned off because it's so annoying, but sucks, right?</p><p>Never works. If you give it the power of the best open AI model, and then the speed of running it natively on the iPhone, I don't know what they're going to do about that. But presumably, there are things they can do to speed it up. And then you give it access to the internal API's you're using to control apps.</p><p>That would be really powerful. You could be an agent that you can just tell it to do things. And you know, not just ask like the weather and the time and set alarms. Well, what's really interesting, I think about this deal chamath is Apple is having a hard time getting people to upgrade their phones, right?</p><p>And people have lost faith in the stock. Now you say, hey, we're going to put a language model on here, you can make it a local language model, and have it be privacy protected. So that means you need more memory on the phone, you're going to need another chip on the phone, it's going to there's a distinct reason to upgrade.</p><p>Now, if you had a language model on your phone, and Siri was like this super Siri, that actually got stuff done, I would upgrade my phone immediately. And right now I skipped two or three generations. What are your thoughts on this as a way to maybe reinvigorate the iPhone franchise tomorrow?</p><p>You buy it or not? No, the problem is that we don't know what the right form factor for a super scaled consumer AI app looks like. So we've all again, I'm not trying to be a wet blanket. It's just that when you look at what's built and built so far, I think most of the things we've seen are the Friendster and my spaces of this class of app.</p><p>We haven't seen the Facebook's and the Instagram's yet. And the reason is because we haven't experimented and push the boundaries of the form factor. So for example, in the first phases of social networking, the idea that you would collect information about all your friends and then create something called a newsfeed was totally shocking.</p><p>And I remember when we first released that people got really upset. And then it just became this de facto. Why were they upset about it? Tell me? Well, it's this idea that you collected this information, and then you presented it about all of your friends was disconcerting in the shot as a feature.</p><p>Now, if you don't have a newsfeed of some kind in your app, for many apps, it's do a right. So the same problem exists today. All we've done today is we've replicated an existing use case with a slightly better feature here or there. Nobody has gone out and said on a blank canvas, let me completely reimagine how consumers want value with these things to enable it.</p><p>And until that happens, we're just wasting time. So the idea that Apple with this $1,000 device is all of a sudden going to figure out that this is why you're going to upgrade, I think is pretty speculative. And I think they're going to be disappointed. I think people have realized that four generations ago was more than enough.</p><p>And on top of this, the stuff that you value inside the iPhone is not what you're going to need for AI. So spending a trillion billion dollars on the fourth camera lens is not going to be what solves this problem. And so you're more likely to have a very simple earbud that is, you know, very inconspicuous and discreetly in your inner ear.</p><p>Well, speaking information to you, then you are and with a companion $500 phone, then I think you will be with a 1500. You're in the new form factor, I am going to take the other side of the cap, I think that because you have this data on your phone, all your iMessages, all your documents, all your photos, videos, music collection, there's a unique set of data on that phone to make your personal LLM, that's going to do extraordinary things for you, because it's going to watch you and all your behavior on that phone.</p><p>And man, if I can have a personal LLM that's been watching me order very specific sushi rolls, or, you know, where I send my ubers, what type of ubers I like what music I play, I feel like that LLM don't need to be deep. My point is, you don't need a $1500 device to do that.</p><p>So if you know, but it's I'm talking about data set. So cool. Don't you? Uber has the data. DoorDash has the data. No, no, you're missing my point. The data of me clicking on the screen, that is not apples to collect. It's not there. I think they'll collect it, put it in there, you would have to encrypt have to fundamentally change the SDK.</p><p>The idea then that Apple can take a tax on that is outrageous. I think the whole app economy would blow up if Apple tried to do that. I think it's the opposite. I think the app economy would thrive. You'd be have this a great thing where I could tell it order the same thing I ordered on door.</p><p>Apple to try to change the terms of service and see what happens. Okay, freeberg your thoughts on this. Any thoughts? No. Okay, well, let's get to this. It's time for science corner temperatures in the Atlantic Ocean are alarmingly high. freeberg. A couple weeks ago, we saw this crazy chart on the X about the Atlantic Ocean temperatures, pre Hurricane Katrina right about now and take us through this because it's very disconcerting.</p><p>There's not much to talk about except to highlight this image which shows again, we talked about this a few months ago, hot ocean temperatures drive hurricane and tropical storm activity because as the wind, the air above the ocean starts to move, the energy from the ocean gets pulled out, you know, like things cool down, the water cools down, but that energy actually goes back into pushing the wind to move faster and faster.</p><p>And that's how tropical storms, cyclones, and hurricanes are formed is warm ocean temperatures. And there's been this kind of persistent warming since last year in the Atlantic, in this particular region, where all the hurricanes form. And normally the hurricane season starts kind of call it August to October. Right now we are seeing temperatures that are so far beyond what we've seen.</p><p>Anytime historically, this image that you're looking at here actually compares the ocean temperatures right now in the Atlantic, to where we were at the same time period in 2005, which was a record hurricane year, obviously with Hurricane Katrina, right? Yeah. And so their National Hurricane Center, a lot of the climatologists are forecasting that over the next couple of months, we could see and should expect to see probabilistically, much larger, stronger, bigger, more frequent hurricanes than we've ever seen historically.</p><p>So we'll see if it plays out. Just a very small tidbit of news to share, thought it'd be worth highlighting, not getting a lot of main mainstream media press attention. But, you know, certainly, to just confirm a couple of things for me, because we live in a time where people are questioning science and scientists, and we have institutions we don't trust, whether it's three letter agencies in Washington, or scientists and all these papers being written and everything we're finding out and nobody trusts anybody.</p><p>And we're sort of resetting trust. I want to just ask you as somebody I trust as a scientist, number one, global warming, temperatures increasing, putting aside, you know what we do about it temperatures in the ocean, it is undeniable are increasing at a rate that you would describe as concerning.</p><p>Am I correct? We have not seen in the modern era, temperatures in the ocean like we're seeing now, that's a fact, right? I'm not going to do this whole big prognosis on everything all in one, because I think that's where people feel like there's room for discrediting things. I'm trying to so we can do this.</p><p>Yeah, we can be very specific about things. Here's an example. So this is the sea surface temperature going back to 1981. Okay. And as you can see, at this point in the year, and you know, the temperature oscillates because of the way the earth tilts towards the sun. And so at this point in the year, we are seeing right now, sea surface temperatures that are beyond anything we've seen, historically, and it is continuing to climb.</p><p>So if this does not taper off or level off, we will see record sea surface temperatures in the August to October timeframe, which will almost certainly push massive hurricane events out of the Atlantic, and they will find their way towards the continent. So this is super clarifying, this should not be controversial to anybody, we have temperature readings in the ocean, and just data, data, it's just simply data, right.</p><p>So you know, putting aside what political party you on and what you think about gas and oil, I will tell you, there's a lot of theory, one of one of the theories. So there's theories about El Nino, there's theories about climate change contributing to this. There's also a theory about sulfur dioxide, that has now been banned in shipping and cargo vessels that go across the oceans.</p><p>Last year, they banned sulfur dioxide use in the fuel that that's coming out of these, and sulfur dioxide actually reflect sunlight. So as it goes up into the air, into the atmosphere coming out of these ships, it actually blocks and reflects light. So that would make the oceans cooler.</p><p>And so a lot of folks have said that over the last couple of decades, we've actually dampened the temperature and the warming that's happened on earth because of all the sulfur dioxide we've been putting up into the atmosphere. But because sulfur dioxide causes acid rain, environmentalists have been pushing for years to ban sulfur dioxide.</p><p>The problem is with banning sulfur dioxide, you may have this other side effect, which is now more rapid increased warming got of the surface and of the oceans. So these are complex systems, and you we should be delicate with them. If you were to give us a prescription here, freeberg.</p><p>What's like a basic prescription? Are we just experimenting in a way that is not advisable with, you know, this ecosystem? And we should just not run the experiment. I think that might be like a non political non charged way to say it. Like, this experiment is a little bit too crazy to run on the one planet Earth we have.</p><p>Yeah. Which experiment? The experiment of doing things that increase global warming, which would be you mean living? Well, yeah, I mean, not burning fossil fuels. People are just acting in their own economic best interest. Yes. And if that economic best interest increases temperature so much. I think there's a freeberg that it will compromise the oceans and damage them to a point that would be extremely concerning is I guess what I'm getting at.</p><p>There is a reduction in biodiversity that's underway. We can see that, like using data, but to Chamath's point, humans have prioritized the progression of individuals forward. China had a billion people that came out of poverty in 30 years. Yeah. And they came out of poverty because of the industrialization, making production of consumable goods, that that population gets to consume, they get access to more calories, you get access to more foods, they get to have cars, they get to have houses, all of that making cement making concrete, all of those things require industrial systems.</p><p>And those industrial systems have a cost. That cost is the dollar economic cost, which we're kind of rationalizing with very productivity, then there's this whole cost that's externalized. Got it. Yeah, we understand that. Yeah. Right. So so that's the tension is like, if you're wealthy, if you're a wealthy nation, if you're the Western Europe or the United States, you get to stand up and say, stop carbon.</p><p>But if you're the rest of the world, you're like, I want to have a home. I want to write you want to have the same evolution stuff that America went through, or you're I want to I want to progress as a as a person, I want to progress as a society.</p><p>And that's the tension that makes us a very difficult problem to resolve, which is how to more the world get to progress. While you were like being cognizant of what I'm trying to get at free bird. I am optimistic. So let me just say this. Oh, yeah, cuz that's what I'm getting at.</p><p>Are you optimistic? Are you pessimistic? Tell us. I believe strongly that there is a strong relationship between the output of atmospheric carbon and the deleterious effects we see in ecosystems. Okay. That is something I feel like is true from data. I am not however, as pessimistic that the world is going to end in the next decade or two, because I see improvements in productivity, meaning how many units we get out for every unit in or how many units we get out for every unit of carbon that's emitted.</p><p>And those productivity meaning better technology systems are rapidly changing how we make things and how people are accessing goods and services. And I think that that's why I am like, because I'm a techno optimist, I'm optimistic about where things are headed are headed. And it is also why I get very angry and upset about any efforts or attempts to slow down the adoption of technology, because these things will pull people forward and make that happen faster without all the deleterious side effects that we've unfortunately had to do in the absence of technology.</p><p>So trim off, I'll pull you into here. So based on what freeberg is saying here, yes, these things are occurring, but the technology and the advances we're seeing in but one example, solar, and then some people might bring up nuclear and other ones, we just had filled to each of my conference this week, give a great talk on this.</p><p>Solar is just getting so cheap, batteries are getting so cheap, putting batteries in your home, putting solar in, you know, and then putting data centers next to nuclear things. This is all adding up to we can solve this problem. And so you to feel optimistic about this? Yeah, totally.</p><p>I think that climate change stalled when it was an emotional and philosophical rallying cry, largely of the left. When instead, it became something about resilience, and domestic manufacturing, both sides came together. And I think we're at a point now where the US is energy independence plus, the amount of reliance on non carbon based fuels will drive a sea change in the United States, I think it'll be copied in Western Europe.</p><p>And it's also going to be at enough of a low price point where it'll get embraced in the developing world. So it's a it's an incredible example of if you want to take an idea, and a bunch of solutions, and want to die on the hill of messaging and platitudes, it'll make no progress.</p><p>But if instead, you're willing to sort of be less extreme about it, and actually just frame it in economic value add, all of a sudden, everybody embraces it and just becomes obvious. So I think that we're going to do wonders over the next 20 and 30 and 40 years all over the world.</p><p>To push back on the general state of warming. But I think it will have happened because the economic incentives aligned, not because of a philosophical or emotional framing of the issue. All right, everybody, this has been a very productive episode of the number one podcast in the world, the all in podcast.</p><p>And good luck tonight, gentlemen, with your fundraiser. I wish you great luck. David Sachs and Chamath Palihapiti. Even if it's not my preferred candidate, that's totally fine. We could all differ and you can have a great, great event tonight. Good luck. I have one thing. Okay, good. I have one more birthday in my family.</p><p>Today, making us all look bad.

We had a nice little birthday cake at the liquidity summit this week for him. I had a cake made.</p><p>Thank you for showing your birthday. And here we go. And, and it's also a k 47. Alan Keating's birthday today is all the same. But I love Alan Keating is one of my 45 and one is 47. Do you know the significance of that? Of course, he's gonna win all the elections.</p><p>And there we go. Here we go. I think it's a sign. It's a sign. Listen, I wish good luck to you all tonight. I hope that it goes off well for you for you, gentlemen. And listen, I would love to have Trump on the pod would love to have Biden the pop like all things.</p><p>We just want to have a great conversation here. We keep it respectful. Sometimes it gets a little chippy, but we love each other. And we love you, the audience for participating in this don't fall for the mainstream media is nonsense in trying to divide and conquer. We got important tasks to do and problems to solve in the world.</p><p>And the way we do that is through great conversations. Hopefully we set a tone. An example for everybody else have just had to do that. We still love each other. And sometimes some elbows get flown. And it's all good. Chamath sacks. Good luck tonight. Freeberg. Happy birthday. And bye.</p><p>We'll see you all next time on the number one podcast in the world. The all in pockets tell you friends about love you guys. Bye bye love you. Let your winners ride.
