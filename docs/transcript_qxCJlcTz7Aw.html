Sometimes there's banana bread. Sometimes there's cookies and all kinds of stuff. And I don't have a lot of self-control. And so instead of saying no, which just doesn't work for me that well, I say yes in five minutes. I find that if there's three dozen cookies sitting on the counter and I say, hey, I can have one of these.</p><p>I just have to wait five minutes. In that five-minute period, I've moved on. I've gone to do something. And I've completely forgotten about the cookie. Now, maybe I come back. Maybe I repeat the thing. Maybe I reward myself with a cookie. But it's such a benefit to me and has prevented me from binge eating a lot of cookies, which is something that I often have found myself doing in the past.</p></div></div></body></html>
