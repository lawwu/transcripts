these questions actually is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MI83buT_23o&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.100</a></span> | <span class="t">it changes every two or three months like every time you get to the next tier the the the bottleneck</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MI83buT_23o&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.660</a></span> | <span class="t">that you're running into or the most important capability or the right way you should be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

talk a bit about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MI83buT_23o&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.660</a></span> | <span class="t">some of the the those tiers for us over the last year or so um and you know over the course of that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MI83buT_23o&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.020</a></span> | <span class="t">time obviously you know when we got started um in the end of 2023 obviously agents were not even a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MI83buT_23o&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.820</a></span> | <span class="t">concept um and now everyone has you know everyone's talking about coding agents people are doing more and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MI83buT_23o&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.980</a></span> | <span class="t">more and more and more uh and it's very cool to see um and and each of these has kind of been almost a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MI83buT_23o&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.940</a></span> | <span class="t">discrete tier for us um and so right right around a year ago when we were doing the last ai engineer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MI83buT_23o&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.420</a></span> | <span class="t">talk actually um the the biggest use case that we really saw that that was getting broad adoption was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MI83buT_23o&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.780</a></span> | <span class="t">what i'll kind of call these repetitive migrations and so i'm talking like javascript to typescript</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MI83buT_23o&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.620</a></span> | <span class="t">or like upgrading your angular version from this one to that one or going from this java version to that java</span></div><div class="c"><span

particular what you typically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MI83buT_23o&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.220</a></span> | <span class="t">see is you are you you have some massive code base that you want to apply this whole migration for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MI83buT_23o&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.580</a></span> | <span class="t">you have to go file by file and do every single one and usually the set of steps is pretty clear</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MI83buT_23o&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.300</a></span> | <span class="t">right if you go to the angular website or something like that it'll tell you all right here's what you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MI83buT_23o&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.060</a></span> | <span class="t">have to do this this this this this and um you want to go and execute each of these steps it's not so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MI83buT_23o&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.220</a></span> | <span class="t">routine that there you know there's no classical deterministic program that solves that but there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MI83buT_23o&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.180</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of a clear set of steps and if you can follow those steps very well then you can do the task and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MI83buT_23o&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.820</a></span> | <span class="t">you know this was the thing for us because that was all you could really trust agents to do at the time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MI83buT_23o&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.020</a></span> | <span class="t">you know you could do harder things once in a while and you could do some really cool stuff occasionally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MI83buT_23o&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.020</a></span> | <span class="t">but as far as something that was consistent enough that you could do it over and over and over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MI83buT_23o&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.300</a></span> | <span class="t">these kinds of

generally been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MI83buT_23o&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.100</a></span> | <span class="t">the trend where um ai

able to say okay</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MI83buT_23o&t=831" target="_blank">00:13:51.500</a></span> | <span class="t">i'm quite sure that this is the task and i'm going to go execute it now versus i don't understand what's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MI83buT_23o&t=837"

target="_blank">00:14:40.700</a></span> | <span class="t">if instead of doing it just one task it's you know how do we think about tackling an entire project right</span></div><div class="c"><span
