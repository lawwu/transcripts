This worked every time and it never doesn't work. If you come in with like a lanyard under like a green yellow and purple lanyard, it doesn't really matter, but it's like covered by your suit. And then you also walk in with a glass of wine with wine in it and a cocktail napkin around that glass.</p><p>And you just walk in on the phone. They're like, clearly this guy was just inside the high end party. It works so well that it was such a cheat code. And so that's how, that's how I originally formed a network by like crashing parties. And so that was a great way that I met a lot of mentors.</p><p>And then later in life, I realized like, if I just look at the best men at my wedding, almost all of them were from the internet. Like people I met on the internet years ago, Noah Kagan, Sam Parr, he's been buddies for decades, right? And we met each other through our blogs, through social media.</p><p>And so when you meet, it's, it's like, you got a buddy. And so I also think like posting on the internet and just participating on the internet, you don't even have to post, even replying and having conversations is probably one of the best ways to meet people now.</p></div></div></body></html>
