Even if they're off, they're still draining energy. Is that really where people should focus their time and energy? Or is it really about finding the major things that are causing drain? - It's the major things.</p><p>You wanna hit the low hanging fruit. I mentioned my dehumidifier. When we figured that out, it was like, wow, we saw our energy use decrease by like 20% just by making that one tweak. When you're talking about a television set, it might be pulling two, three watts. It does matter.</p><p>If you have multiple TVs and multiple game consoles and things like that that are just, they're all sucking two, three, five watts, it does add up, but that's not where I would start at all.</p></div></div></body></html>
