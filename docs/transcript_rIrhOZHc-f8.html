I think the whole model of how applications get built across every domain, I think it might just completely change the old model without AI. Typically have some sort of database. You have some sort of front end of the database.</p><p>You have forms, right? You had these sort of known user interaction models, mobile apps, and so forth. We got to a pretty good kind of shared understanding of how humans and machines communicate in the windowing era. And then in the mobile era, the web, I think AI might just upend all that.</p><p>And I think the future apps might just be much more of a dialogue between computer and machine. It's either a text written dialogue or a spoken dialogue or some other form of dialogue and the human is guiding the machine of what to do and receiving real time feedback and that there's a loop and then the machine just does what it does and it gives you the results.</p><p>The very fundamental assumptions about how software gets built, I think might just completely change. And so the, yeah, the tools on that are at the very front end. There's an entirely new stack that needs to get built to do that. Is there a reason though AI is not one of your focus areas?</p><p>Or as far as I know, you guys don't have an AI fund dedicated to that technology specifically. So basically what we look at is it's all of software, right? We look at it as like it is the core business.</p></div></div></body></html>
