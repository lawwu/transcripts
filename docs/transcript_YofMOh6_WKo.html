And I think that is the key to actually general intelligence. And that's the thing that we as humans do amazingly well. For example, I played so many board games now. Uh, when I, if someone was to teach me a new board game, I wouldn't be coming to that fresh anymore.</p><p>I would know, you know, straight away I could apply all of these different heuristics to that I've learned from other games to this new one, even if I've never seen that before. And currently no machines can do that. And I think the key to doing transfer learning is going to be a conceptual knowledge.</p><p>So abstract knowledge. So the, so the acquisition of conceptual knowledge that is abstracted away from the perceptual details of where you learned it from. So then you can go, okay, I'll apply it to this new domain. Um, so I think that's actually one of the, the, the big challenges to be tackled towards a general AI.</p></div></div></body></html>
