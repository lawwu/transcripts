We have a question here from Lisa. Lisa asks, "How can I take regular eye breaks for eye strain in a way that accommodates deep work?" Well, Lisa, I want you to do more productive meditation, make this a bigger part of your habit that is in almost any circumstance where thinking has to be done.</p><p>All right, I'm putting together this strategy memo, what is the outline I want to use? I've received an email from a client or my boss, and it's going to be pretty tricky. Like, how do I answer this right? I got to really think this through, like what I want to propose here.</p><p>I have computer code I need to write, but I really don't know, you know, what type of object do I need here? What's the right algorithmic approach? Whatever it is, whenever you come across what should be if you're non-entry level on a regular basis, some contemplation that has to be done, do that on foot away from a computer screen.</p><p>This is what I call productive meditation, working on a professional problem in your head while walking. This will be hard at first, but you'll get better at it with practice and bring a notebook with you. When we walk, take notes, walk, take notes. You're away from a computer. Notebooks do not cause eye strain.</p><p>And then you come back once you've thought it through and are essentially transcribing that thinking back into your computer world. So if you do most of your non-trivial contemplation on foot, your head, walking and notebook, this will automatically induce a regular rhythm of breaks from your computer screen that really should handle the eye strain, but also I think make you more effective at your work.</p></div></div></body></html>
