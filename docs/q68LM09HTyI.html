target="_blank">00:01:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Tony, it seems to me that over the years, many of the folks that have written to us have wrestled with the basic meaningfulness or significance of life and of reality,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q68LM09HTyI&t=76" target="_blank">00:01:16.000</a></span> | <span

about now of understanding and cherishing the all-embracing, all-pervading providence of God might land on those people, as it does on me, with great preciousness and great significance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q68LM09HTyI&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the third effect of seeing and savoring this providence of God is this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q68LM09HTyI&t=117" target="_blank">00:01:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It establishes a framework of reality in our mind by which we see absolutely everything in the universe, from the smallest to the greatest, as a part of God's meaningful design.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q68LM09HTyI&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In other words, when we look at

absolute existence and wisdom and goodness of God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q68LM09HTyI&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And everything is guided through the infinite wisdom of God, and everything is moving toward the greatest possible goal imaginable, namely the fullest display of the panorama of God's perfections, which we call the glory of God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q68LM09HTyI&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.000</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:03:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Nothing is meaningless.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q68LM09HTyI&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Every thread in the tapestry of reality is being woven by God into a depiction of the glory of God.</span></div><div class="c"><span

bright significance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q68LM09HTyI&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Other threads in themselves are dark with mysterious twists and textures and shades of bloody crimson.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q68LM09HTyI&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes God gives us glimpses of the final depiction of his beauty in all things, and it just takes our breath away.</span></div><div

of the tapestry with its inexplicable tangles and textures and colors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q68LM09HTyI&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">At those times, when providence seems most confusing, we must open our Bibles and listen to the interpretations of God and direct our hearts to the strong affirmations that God has given us with Christ at the center, that he's wise, he's good, he's just, and he is at work in and through all things.</span></div><div class="c"><span
