href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmN29rLs9BA&t=55" target="_blank">00:00:55.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It requires the synthesis of economic information, social information, and health information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmN29rLs9BA&t=62" target="_blank">00:01:02.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And more often than not, a person who typically acts like a manager points to the person they think should be in charge under the circumstance to make a decision.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmN29rLs9BA&t=70" target="_blank">00:01:10.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And that person is not equipped to synthesize the economic and social ramifications of the decision.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmN29rLs9BA&t=75" target="_blank">00:01:15.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So what we have seen during the pandemic is most often people in a governing position have pointed to the health officer or the medical person and said, you make the decision.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmN29rLs9BA&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And that person does not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

class="t">And so the test of leadership during this pandemic has been a test of synthesis and recommending an action that's associated with the understanding of the social, economic, and health implications of what's going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmN29rLs9BA&t=109" target="_blank">00:01:49.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's really where so many governing bodies and individuals have fallen apart during this pandemic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmN29rLs9BA&t=114" target="_blank">00:01:54.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm going to stop there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
