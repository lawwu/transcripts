Unfortunately or fortunately,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-hmLY8V2M&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.640</a></span> | <span class="t">there is no good.

Yes. And that's the thing, is it's circumstantial, and it matters. It not only</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-hmLY8V2M&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">matters your financial situation, but also your personal makeup. If you know that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-hmLY8V2M&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">simply can't handle taking so much risk, then you have to do what works for you. And if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-hmLY8V2M&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you know that you can, and you're going to be okay with it, then yes. That's the thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-hmLY8V2M&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I've come to learn, is just do what works for you. All right. Let's get into the questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-hmLY8V2M&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. I always feel really good about risk until things go against me. First up today,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-hmLY8V2M&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">we have a question from me, actually. I was asking the other day, and we were like, "Let's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-hmLY8V2M&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">just do it on the show." I was asking you, "Is it okay to stop contributing to your 401(k)</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-hmLY8V2M&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">to save up for a down payment?" Yeah. This sounds like a sharp, sharp guy here asking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-hmLY8V2M&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">this question. So you were saying, "Listen, I'm looking to buy a house. We're trying to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-hmLY8V2M&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.040</a></span> | <span class="t">figure out how much we can afford. We're trying to figure out down payment. Is it ever okay?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-hmLY8V2M&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think you also said, "Your wife might get a match regardless, but you, if you stop</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-hmLY8V2M&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.480</a></span> | <span class="t">your 401(k), you don't get the match anymore." Right? Right. I understand the hesitancy here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-hmLY8V2M&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">because a lot of these personal finance experts will shame you, because do you know what those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-hmLY8V2M&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">contributions could be worth in 30 years if you don't put them on? And it is true that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-hmLY8V2M&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">like a match is free money. But it's not like you're turning them off to do Fandu parlays</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-hmLY8V2M&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">all day. Right? Probably not. You're turning them off for a good reason. Sometimes life</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-hmLY8V2M&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">gets in the way of the spreadsheets when it comes to financial planning. You just have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-hmLY8V2M&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.720</a></span> | <span class="t">to divert your savings into other avenues. So the first house we ever bought, it was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-hmLY8V2M&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">a split-level ranch. And the upper half of it was finished. The lower level was unfinished.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-hmLY8V2M&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we kind of said, "Hey, this is great. We can grow into it a little bit. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-hmLY8V2M&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">when the time is right, we can finish out the basement." And it was more expensive than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-hmLY8V2M&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I thought. Now, I will say this. To save some money, my father-in-law knows what he's doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-hmLY8V2M&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">in terms of building and such. So I'd say 50 or 60% of it we did ourselves. I'm not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-hmLY8V2M&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.680</a></span> | <span class="t">handy at all, so I did what I was told. I held this and moved this. But we framed it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-hmLY8V2M&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.600</a></span> | <span class="t">and we did some of the stuff ourselves. So we did two bedrooms, a bathroom, put a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-hmLY8V2M&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">bar in, big TV area. But it cost us. And so for probably a period of like, I don't know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-hmLY8V2M&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">18 to 24 months, that was our big saving focus. And I didn't completely turn off savings elsewhere,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-hmLY8V2M&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">but that was money that could have gone into saving money elsewhere.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-hmLY8V2M&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So would it have been nice to have those dollars go into the market? This is probably 10 years</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-hmLY8V2M&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.720</a></span> | <span class="t">later. Yeah, they'd be worth a lot more money, but my 401(k) wouldn't have added 1,900 square</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-hmLY8V2M&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.420</a></span> | <span class="t">feet to our house either. Right? So I think, listen, it's not easy to save for down payment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-hmLY8V2M&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.920</a></span> | <span class="t">these days, especially in an expensive real estate market like you're in. So I think if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-hmLY8V2M&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you have to go for 6, 12, 18 months, and that's where your personal finance focus is, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-hmLY8V2M&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">you know that afterwards you can turn them back on, what's going to make you happier?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-hmLY8V2M&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Getting your living situation figured out?

Having your own place might make things a little easier. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-hmLY8V2M&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">yes, I bless this decision.
