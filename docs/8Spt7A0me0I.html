I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Spt7A0me0I&t=89" target="_blank">00:01:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">just couldn't think of words to go with them.

So here we go. First, what am I celebrating ultimately? That</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Spt7A0me0I&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">is, what's at the top as the goal of all things when I celebrate the Reformation? And the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Spt7A0me0I&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.100</a></span> | <span class="t">answer is the glory of Jesus Christ. In Calvin's response to the Roman Catholic Sadulei, he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Spt7A0me0I&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.360</a></span> | <span class="t">said, "You touch upon justification by faith, the first and keenest subject of controversy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Spt7A0me0I&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">between us. Wherever the knowledge of it is taken away, the glory of Christ is extinguished."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Spt7A0me0I&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the same point could be made on issue after issue in the disputes of the Reformation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Spt7A0me0I&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So ultimately, we celebrate the exaltation of the glory of Christ. Second, what am I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Spt7A0me0I&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.140</a></span> | <span class="t">celebrating most foundationally? So the first one was most ultimately. Second, most foundationally,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Spt7A0me0I&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.460</a></span> | <span class="t">that is, what's at the bottom as the ground of all things when I celebrate the Reformation?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Spt7A0me0I&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And the answer is the free and sovereign grace of God. When Martin Luther came to the end</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Spt7A0me0I&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.420</a></span> | <span class="t">of his life, he regarded his book, The Bondage of the Will, as his most important work. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Spt7A0me0I&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.140</a></span> | <span class="t">the reason is because he regarded the issue of human autonomy versus sovereign grace as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Spt7A0me0I&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.220</a></span> | <span class="t">the key underlying issue of the Reformation. He said, "I condemn and reject as nothing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Spt7A0me0I&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.700</a></span> | <span class="t">but error all doctrines which exalt our free will as being directly opposed to this mediation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Spt7A0me0I&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.860</a></span> | <span class="t">and grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. For since apart from Christ, sin and death are our masters</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Spt7A0me0I&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and the devil is our God and prince, there can be no strength or power, no wit or wisdom</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Spt7A0me0I&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.660</a></span> | <span class="t">by which we can fit or fashion ourselves for righteousness and life." Which means that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Spt7A0me0I&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.580</a></span> | <span class="t">as long as someone insists on ultimate human self-determination, they fail to grasp the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Spt7A0me0I&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">depth of our need and they obscure the greatness of the free and sovereign grace of God, which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Spt7A0me0I&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">alone can give life and faith.
