And the time I have,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=60" target="_blank">00:01:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm exhausted. Hence, I haven't opened up a new credit card in a long time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=64" target="_blank">00:01:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and I've stopped tracking my expenses and net worth monthly.

But at this stage in life, it's not a priority.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=73" target="_blank">00:01:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Can you relate to this with two young kids of your own? Would love to hear your reflections.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=77" target="_blank">00:01:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I totally relate to this. Time is the newfound finite resource. And honestly, I think about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">life before children, and I think, "Oh, wow, sometimes we had weekends where we just didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=87" target="_blank">00:01:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">do anything. We just sat at home, did nothing. We have friends that don't have kids, and that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">what they do sometimes." And I have no idea how that life must feel. It doesn't relate to me at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=96" target="_blank">00:01:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">all. And what this person wrote relates to me completely. So when I think about the things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=101" target="_blank">00:01:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">you said, the way I try to think about it, and in some cases, I think the person who wrote this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">question, in a way, I wish that I was more like them, because I haven't been as good at sometimes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=111" target="_blank">00:01:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">letting go of these things that are probably not as important as maybe sleep or being more present</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.600</a></span> | <span class="t">in some cases. But I've also tried to find easier ways to do some of them. And so if I look back to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the way we budgeted and tracked, and you probably remember this non-pleasantly, we would go down and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">we'd categorize all our transactions at the end of the year or the end of the quarter, and we'd run</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">through the spreadsheet. And now, yes, there's more flexibility when you build your own spreadsheet</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">that can do everything. But when we started using Copilot, it's like in very short one,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">two-minute intervals, I can categorize transactions when I'm going to the bathroom,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">when I'm in the line somewhere. And so that's made it easy to keep budgeting on track, have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=155" target="_blank">00:02:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">a good sense of how much we're spending without having to put a lot of time. Shout out to Copilot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">They've been a sponsor of the show for a while. Not as long as I've been using the app though.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Really great product. So there are ways to do some of these things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.520</a></span> | <span class="t">But when it comes to opening up new credit cards, I am aware that there are people who manage to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">open up 10, 15 cards a year and get tremendous reward for doing that. And their credit scores</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.560</a></span> | <span class="t">go up, and they have millions of points. And it's been in the back of my mind, just like this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">person, that we could probably do that at more velocity than we are, more than one or two cards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And we talked about 524 in an episode. I was looking and both of us are at like 224. We could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">be doing more. But I think one of the challenges I have is that I want to get it right. It's like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't want to get a new card until I figure out the sequence of all the cards that makes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">sense for everything to play out in the exact perfect and optimal way. And so I've done nothing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, the good news is I'm okay with that because I just don't have the free time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">to spend on this longer project. But I probably need to come back to the middle ground a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">bit more satisficing of, "You know what? Getting one card is not going to change my 524 status.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm still going to be okay." And so maybe in the last six months that's happened, I've said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">"Oh, here's a good opportunity." And some of it was forced. The US Bank Altitude Reserve card was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">closing, and I just had to throw it in before it went away. And so it forced my hand and I felt</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.560</a></span> | <span class="t">pretty good about getting forced there. Was it the best signup bonus ever? No, but I feel okay about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">it. So yes, I think I agree with a lot of this. When it comes to the simplicity side of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">equation, that really speaks to me. I think we used to have, I don't know, seven, eight bank</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.040</a></span> | <span class="t">accounts, multiple brokerage accounts, lying all over the place, maybe doing bank bonuses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And you probably at the time were like, "This is a mess." It was overwhelming. And I love the fact</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that kids have forced us to simplify in these areas because it feels like a mental decluttering</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">of having to keep track of all of these different things in addition to kids. Yeah. So now we moved</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">everything to Mercury's personal account.

I also think that creating a judgment-free zone is really helpful because particularly when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=722" target="_blank">00:12:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">they're young, they might do something really silly and it might feel like a very small thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=728" target="_blank">00:12:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you remain really open-minded and judgment-free for the small things,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=733" target="_blank">00:12:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I think over time, then when big things actually come up, they'll feel a lot more open to sharing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=739" target="_blank">00:12:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">those things as well.

One perspective I have,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1129" target="_blank">00:18:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and I'd be curious to get your thoughts, and then I'll finish this list, is when we were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1133" target="_blank">00:18:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">thinking about taking time off, we originally thought about staggering it where you would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1138" target="_blank">00:18:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">take three months and I would take three months. That was probably from a place of saving money,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1143" target="_blank">00:19:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">where it was like we would maximize the number of months we would have where we didn't need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1147" target="_blank">00:19:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to hire any help to take care of the kids so we could both be working. But I'm really glad</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1152" target="_blank">00:19:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">we didn't do that because I think it was good to both have some overlapping time in those early</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1159" target="_blank">00:19:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">months. But I'm curious what you think. I seem to recall we actually did test it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1165" target="_blank">00:19:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">for a very short period of time in the first few weeks. I think the takeaway from my perspective</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1174" target="_blank">00:19:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">was as much as we wanted to optimize you going straight back to work and my spending time with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1180" target="_blank">00:19:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the baby first, and then later I go back and then you take time off to be with the baby,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1185" target="_blank">00:19:45.840</a></span> | <span class="t">it was really hard. And I think particularly early on, it's like you assume everything is just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1191" target="_blank">00:19:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">going to be normal life but with a baby that sleeps a lot. And the reality of it is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1197" target="_blank">00:19:57.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the emotional demands, you just don't expect it in the way that it actually pans out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1204" target="_blank">00:20:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I think what had happened is we tested it for a few weeks and I got to a point where I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1209" target="_blank">00:20:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">like, "This is not working. So why don't we see if you can actually take some paid time off now?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1215" target="_blank">00:20:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And we then ended up sharing some overlap there. And that was actually really nice because it was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1221" target="_blank">00:20:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">really good family bonding time and allowed us both a bit of reprieve in those moments</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1226" target="_blank">00:20:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that we weren't expecting to need it, but we did. So I love the optimization mindset that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1230" target="_blank">00:20:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">we went in with. But I think the reality was just very different than what we had planned.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1236" target="_blank">00:20:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I also think now that you say this, people say early parenting is kind of a blur. And now I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1240" target="_blank">00:20:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">like, "Oh yeah, actually now I remember part of this." One thing that I also realized was there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1244" target="_blank">00:20:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">was one week, I think, where I tested in some way, I was like 100% on. And I realized being 100% on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1252" target="_blank">00:20:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">is a lot. Being a full-time childcare caregiver for one child and even more if it's two the next</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1262" target="_blank">00:21:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">time, is just a really hard thing. And so I think we both realized, you alluded to that also, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1269" target="_blank">00:21:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I would rather spend the money to be able to go back to work after three months and have the first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1278" target="_blank">00:21:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">three months be both of us. And so very appreciative that we even had that time off because I know not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1283" target="_blank">00:21:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">everyone does. But I now remember that I was like, "Wow, if I wait three months and then you go back</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1289" target="_blank">00:21:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">to work, I'm 100% on for three months straight." And that might be harder than I thought. And I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1295" target="_blank">00:21:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">think the early glimpses I got at it were that it might be. So... It's hard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1298" target="_blank">00:21:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's see, a few other things. So figuring out that childcare once whatever parental leave you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1304" target="_blank">00:21:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">have is over is really important. There's both the childcare that you might want right after</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1309" target="_blank">00:21:49.360</a></span> | <span class="t">giving birth. There are a handful of options, family members, taking time off. There are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1315" target="_blank">00:21:55.520</a></span> | <span class="t">night nurses and night nannies. There are baby nurses, which are more full-time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1320" target="_blank">00:22:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">more popular on the East Coast. There is different forms of live-in help, especially a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1327" target="_blank">00:22:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Asian cultures have this concept of a period of time, maybe it's three weeks to 30 days or longer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1335" target="_blank">00:22:15.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Often the grandmother or the mother of the mother will come and take care of mom and the baby to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1340" target="_blank">00:22:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">give mom time to recover. We actually ended up finding a Korean agency that set up a service</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1347" target="_blank">00:22:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">like that. And I'll put a link to it in the show notes if anyone's interested. But it was a really,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1352" target="_blank">00:22:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">really interesting experience. It was kind of of the ilks of us loving this cultural exchange</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1357" target="_blank">00:22:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">of having different people and cultures in our home. So we had someone come in and live with us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1361" target="_blank">00:22:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">for the first, I think, three weeks. And it was a very different experience. She didn't speak</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1365" target="_blank">00:22:45.840</a></span> | <span class="t">English very well. So there was a little bit of a communication barrier. But at the end of the day,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1370" target="_blank">00:22:50.560</a></span> | <span class="t">the baby doesn't speak English either, right? So showing someone how to wash a baby, you could just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1375" target="_blank">00:22:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">watch and see how that works. And so that was really, really helpful for those first few weeks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1379" target="_blank">00:22:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I realized how fortunate we were to be able to do that. But also just asking your parents what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1384" target="_blank">00:23:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">their intention is. Some people find out their parents are planning to come and stay with them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1389" target="_blank">00:23:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">for a few weeks, whether they ask for it or not. And some people might ask for it and find out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1394" target="_blank">00:23:14.240</a></span> | <span class="t">their parents are not interested. I think both of our parents wanted to come and visit and be a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1400" target="_blank">00:23:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">little helpful, but neither of them had any intention on moving in and helping for any period</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1406" target="_blank">00:23:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">of time more than a few days. And so be upfront and ask about that is important. A couple other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1411" target="_blank">00:23:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">quick ones. There's this thing called cord banking, where you can take the umbilical cord and kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1415" target="_blank">00:23:35.520</a></span> | <span class="t">bank it for some future use case. We didn't do this. But I do remember they asked us at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1420" target="_blank">00:23:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">hospital if we were going to do it. But had you not decided beforehand, you couldn't. You needed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1425" target="_blank">00:23:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">to come with, I don't know, some kit to put it in or something. And so if you want to do that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1429" target="_blank">00:23:49.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you want to figure that out in advance after your kid's born, getting their social security number,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1433" target="_blank">00:23:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">getting their passport.

Another one is just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1441" target="_blank">00:24:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">figuring out what your plan is in case something happens to you or your partner. And so making sure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1447" target="_blank">00:24:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">you have a will, making sure you figure out who your guardian is, making sure you figure out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1452" target="_blank">00:24:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">if you have enough assets and you want to avoid probate, you could go for the full estate plan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1457" target="_blank">00:24:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And so shout out to Trust and Will, which is who we use to set up our will and estate plan and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1464" target="_blank">00:24:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">all that. And since doing that, we have brought on as a partner on the show. That's something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1467" target="_blank">00:24:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">important, especially because I think it's obvious to some people who the guardian of their children</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1473" target="_blank">00:24:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">might be. And then as you start thinking about it from the perspective of, "Oh, well, who do I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1477" target="_blank">00:24:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">will raise these children in the way that we want to raise these children?" That question might not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1482" target="_blank">00:24:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">be the person you initially thought. And so that's one that took a little bit of time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1487" target="_blank">00:24:47.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Couple quick ones.

And you can do it all from home. You might not even have to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1511" target="_blank">00:25:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">do a doctor's appointment. So check out the show notes there. Let's see. Finding a pediatrician,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1515" target="_blank">00:25:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">because you usually have doctor's appointments days after the hospital. And so some people end</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1520" target="_blank">00:25:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">up not thinking about that and then scrambling. If you want to figure out and be intentional about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1525" target="_blank">00:25:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">who your children's doctor will be, you can figure that out in advance. Only other thing is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1528" target="_blank">00:25:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">don't go overboard on your registry. I think sometimes you can buy all this stuff and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1533" target="_blank">00:25:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">either not need it.

But those are all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1554" target="_blank">00:25:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the things on my notion list. You have anything else to add there? Yeah.

And we ended up giving away</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1573" target="_blank">00:26:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">in brand new condition, in boxes, a lot of the stuff that we had purchased and/or been gifted,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1578" target="_blank">00:26:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">because you just don't need the things you think you might need.

And then the other thing is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1691" target="_blank">00:28:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I think we did a bunch of research up front.

So I would say just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1731" target="_blank">00:28:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">wait until you actually need it and then go deep down those rabbit holes because you will,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1735" target="_blank">00:28:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">whether you want to or not.

The only other thing I'll add here is that in those early</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1755" target="_blank">00:29:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">days, I will say as your children get older, first it gets a little harder to get around,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1759" target="_blank">00:29:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">then it gets easier. But those first few six months, we were right in the middle of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1763" target="_blank">00:29:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">pandemic. So we didn't really get to take advantage of this. But there's a window of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1767" target="_blank">00:29:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">time where your kid will sleep anywhere, on your chest, sleep in a stroller, sleep in almost every</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1772" target="_blank">00:29:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">way, shape or form.

Because once your kids are running around and wanting to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1789" target="_blank">00:29:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">crawl and not napping as much, it's just a lot harder. And then it gets easier. We're seeing now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1795" target="_blank">00:29:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">with our kids, one's done napping, one's almost done napping, both out of diapers. It's actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1800" target="_blank">00:30:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">starting to get easier again. But those first six months were actually also easy in terms of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1807" target="_blank">00:30:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">your kid can sleep anywhere.

And so find a way to enjoy that time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1820" target="_blank">00:30:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, it's a great point. And it just speaks to all the different phases that the children and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1827" target="_blank">00:30:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the parents need as they grow. And so actually, one of the questions that came in was around</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1833" target="_blank">00:30:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">childcare. And that's changed from us from when the baby was three months versus when the child</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1839" target="_blank">00:30:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">is 1, 2, 5, 10. And so someone wrote in a question and asked, "How did you think about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1844" target="_blank">00:30:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">childcare options? And what led you to decide on an au pair?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1848" target="_blank">00:30:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is an interesting one, because I had four or five au pairs as a kid. And so had I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1854" target="_blank">00:30:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">not had that experience, I don't even know if I would have known what an au pair was. So I've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1858" target="_blank">00:30:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">actually gotten some feedback from people in person that didn't know what an au pair was.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1861" target="_blank">00:31:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">They're like, "Gosh, it sounds so fancy. It sounds like so expensive in this very elite thing."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1867" target="_blank">00:31:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I was like, "Really? Can I tell you more about it?" Because it's actually not that at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1871" target="_blank">00:31:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, yes, you do need more means to have childcare. But on the spectrum of childcare</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1876" target="_blank">00:31:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">options, it's certainly not the most expensive version of childcare. And so I think naturally,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1882" target="_blank">00:31:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">as we did, we were like, "Let's explore all the options." Just because I had an au pair as a child</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1887" target="_blank">00:31:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">isn't like, "Oh, we have to have this thing." So we actually did compare all the options.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1891" target="_blank">00:31:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">We looked at nannies. We looked at daycare. We looked at Montessori kindergartens that start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1896" target="_blank">00:31:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">really young. We looked at au pairs. And we looked at multiple au pair agencies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1901" target="_blank">00:31:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">We interviewed some nannies. We kind of tried to cover the entire spectrum</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1906" target="_blank">00:31:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and understand pros and cons of everything. And are there some tricks here?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1910" target="_blank">00:31:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">One fun trick for daycare was a lot of daycares are full, right? You try to get in and they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1915" target="_blank">00:31:55.520</a></span> | <span class="t">like, "We don't have any space." And so someone told me, "Look, sometimes they only have space</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1918" target="_blank">00:31:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">one or two days a week. So even if you want five days a week, start with the one or two days a week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1923" target="_blank">00:32:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And then when another day opens up, they usually give it to the people who are going part-time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1927" target="_blank">00:32:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you want to quickly get your way into full-time, don't wait for the five-day-a-week</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1932" target="_blank">00:32:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">option. Take a limited day." So that was one thing. So we looked at all of these. And I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1937" target="_blank">00:32:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">we really settled on the au pair program because it was really interesting. So I'll let you talk a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1943" target="_blank">00:32:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">little bit about why. But for a little context, the way this program works is someone from another</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1950" target="_blank">00:32:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">country spends one year and potentially up to a second year in the US on what's called a cultural</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1956" target="_blank">00:32:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">exchange. And there's actually a Department of State-issued visa for cultural exchange similar</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1962" target="_blank">00:32:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to a student visa in that they're not allowed to go get jobs in the United States and be fully</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1967" target="_blank">00:32:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">employed, but they are allowed to come. And the trade-off that is part of this cultural exchange</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1973" target="_blank">00:32:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">is you provide room and board, and they provide childcare for up to 45 hours a week. And there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1980" target="_blank">00:33:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">are some very specific rules and restrictions on how that works. They can't work for more than 10</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1986" target="_blank">00:33:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">hours straight. And you need to give them a weekend off.

But it ends up being a very, very flexible program. And from a cost standpoint,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=1996" target="_blank">00:33:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">depending on how many children you have, it's probably one of the most affordable options of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2001" target="_blank">00:33:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">all forms of childcare with the understanding that you're giving up a room in your house</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2007" target="_blank">00:33:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">to someone that's living in your house.

I love that we get to expose our kids to people from other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2017" target="_blank">00:33:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">countries. But there is a cost. If you don't have an extra bedroom, it's just not an option for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2022" target="_blank">00:33:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But we have actually talked to some friends who realized that if they're renting a place</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2027" target="_blank">00:33:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">with two bedrooms, renting a place with a third bedroom would cost more, but would actually,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2031" target="_blank">00:33:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">in the long run, be cheaper than having a two-bedroom with a nanny and a three-bedroom</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2036" target="_blank">00:33:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">with an au pair. They actually saved money in that perspective. So something to consider.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2040" target="_blank">00:34:00.640</a></span> | <span class="t">But why don't you talk a little bit about why we ended up doing this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2043" target="_blank">00:34:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">There were so many upsides to having an au pair and being part of that program that I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2049" target="_blank">00:34:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">ultimately, it just made so much sense.

And I think that was really,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2097" target="_blank">00:34:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">really important. I think the other thing that was really helpful is obviously what we were looking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2104" target="_blank">00:35:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">for with a six-month-old baby was very different at the time than what we are looking for today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2112" target="_blank">00:35:12.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? And it's great that through the same program year after year, you can take a step</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2118" target="_blank">00:35:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">back and reassess, "Okay, what do we need for our kids or our family this year?" And we can go out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2123" target="_blank">00:35:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and look for those specific traits. So early on, it was good energy and someone who's able to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2130" target="_blank">00:35:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">verbalize and communicate and use language and music and play with our baby. And now with one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2137" target="_blank">00:35:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">being in school, one being very part-time, someone who is actually willing to take on more of that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2143" target="_blank">00:35:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">educational element and is really invested in early childhood education is really important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2148" target="_blank">00:35:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's what we've been able to find through the program. We've primarily done all of our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2152" target="_blank">00:35:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">searching with CulturalCare, the agency we've used for all five au pairs. In the early days,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2156" target="_blank">00:35:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">we did explore some of the other agencies. But if we talk about features, I don't want to promise</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2160" target="_blank">00:36:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that they exist for all au pair agencies, but they definitely exist for CulturalCare,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2165" target="_blank">00:36:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">which is who we used. And one thing, we didn't talk about this process, but when you're looking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2169" target="_blank">00:36:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">for an au pair, you can go and browse hundreds of profiles, maybe thousands of profiles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2174" target="_blank">00:36:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you mentioned we were looking for these different things. So in the process,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2178" target="_blank">00:36:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">it's almost in a way like a dating app where you're filtering for things or a recruiting site.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2184" target="_blank">00:36:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">We were like, "Okay, we're looking for someone.

If it's really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2188" target="_blank">00:36:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">important for your kids to learn Portuguese, you can focus on certain places.

And for some people, they might want more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2226" target="_blank">00:37:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">spontaneity. Some people might want someone that's very neat and organized. And those are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2230" target="_blank">00:37:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">all things that you can drill down on, and then interview someone and have some video calls.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2235" target="_blank">00:37:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Which I'm laughing because my parents did this before video calls. And so they just had a piece</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2240" target="_blank">00:37:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">of paper and a photo. And they're like, "Great, we'll have this person live with us for a year."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2244" target="_blank">00:37:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">We've been fortunate to have like four or five video calls and get to know someone and maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2247" target="_blank">00:37:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">meet their parents and all that kind of stuff. So I think throughout the process, it's not like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2253" target="_blank">00:37:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">we want this and someone shows up on your door, you've gotten a chance to talk to 10, 12 people,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2258" target="_blank">00:37:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">whatever the right number is for you, and find someone that you think is really going to be a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2261" target="_blank">00:37:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">good fit. The other thing that I have really appreciated about the program is the flexibility</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2267" target="_blank">00:37:47.120</a></span> | <span class="t">that you get. And so it's not like set hours, every single week, week after week, that we found</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2275" target="_blank">00:37:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">to be asked more prevalently with nannies. We're able to change the schedule weekly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2282" target="_blank">00:38:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">daily, if needed. And it's nice because you have such a close working relationship</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2288" target="_blank">00:38:08.560</a></span> | <span class="t">with the au pair because they live with you, they're integrated into your family,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2292" target="_blank">00:38:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">such that it becomes a lot easier to say, "Oh, hey, you know, we have this big thing coming up."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2297" target="_blank">00:38:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Or, "Hey, it looks like our daughter is coming down to something. So we might need to change</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2302" target="_blank">00:38:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">the hours for tomorrow because she might not be going to school or whatever it might be."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2306" target="_blank">00:38:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there's an added layer of flexibility because they're just way more in tune with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2311" target="_blank">00:38:31.520</a></span> | <span class="t">what's happening in the family. And because they may be sitting down having dinner with you the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2315" target="_blank">00:38:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">night before, they get a little bit of visibility into the next day. And so that's been a huge win</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2322" target="_blank">00:38:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">for us, particularly when things become more demanding, either personally or professionally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2327" target="_blank">00:38:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. And because they're part of the family, we bring our au pair on vacations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2330" target="_blank">00:38:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So from a flexibility standpoint, when we went to Hawaii, yes, there was an added cost,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2336" target="_blank">00:38:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">we got another room, but we also had her with us. And so we try really hard when we're on these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2342" target="_blank">00:39:02.560</a></span> | <span class="t">vacations to make sure that they also get to go explore. So they're not working a full week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2347" target="_blank">00:39:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So every one of our au pairs has been like, "Hawaii is the best place. We've been able to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2350" target="_blank">00:39:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">bring them. They love it." But then there's also been a couple days where in one case,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2354" target="_blank">00:39:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I was at a conference. In one case, we wanted to just have a date and go explore. And so we've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2359" target="_blank">00:39:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">been able to do that. So whether it's date nights or weekends or evenings, we've been able to have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2364" target="_blank">00:39:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">that flexibility even while traveling, which is something that I think is really different about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2370" target="_blank">00:39:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">having an au pair versus a nanny or daycare, where it's a lot harder to have weekend support.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2375" target="_blank">00:39:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Your daycare is not going on vacation with you. And so if you are looking for an au pair,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2379" target="_blank">00:39:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">obviously, we've had a great experience with Cultural Care. They're the largest agency</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2383" target="_blank">00:39:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">in the country. I think they have the best search. I know they're doing background checks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2388" target="_blank">00:39:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">They have a great mobile app. They have local coordinators called LCCs around. So one of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2393" target="_blank">00:39:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">nice things is you're not the only person there to support this person in a new country. There's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2399" target="_blank">00:39:59.600</a></span> | <span class="t">person especially for that. And I think one of the great things about having a big agency is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2403" target="_blank">00:40:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that the other au pairs in that agency are also around. And so there is a community for that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2408" target="_blank">00:40:08.560</a></span> | <span class="t">person. So one of the biggest things that I've heard people say is, "Gosh, do we have this person</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2412" target="_blank">00:40:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">living in our house all the time?"

Yeah. I didn't read the full question Omar wrote, but one of them was like, "We've been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2670" target="_blank">00:44:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">thinking about private and we wonder if the money can be better spent elsewhere." So I think one big</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2675" target="_blank">00:44:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">question before you even have to consider this is, do you have the financial resources to make this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2681" target="_blank">00:44:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">work?

But then if you do have the resources, are they worth it? It would really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2696" target="_blank">00:44:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">come down to, well, what is the trade-off?

I will say in some parts of the country where I grew up, there was a gifted and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2727" target="_blank">00:45:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">talented program. In some parts of the country, there are magnet schools and charter schools that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2732" target="_blank">00:45:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">are part of the public program.

I actually would say there's probably more resources for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2754" target="_blank">00:45:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">people who are a little bit behind than people who are ahead, at least in our school district</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=2759" target="_blank">00:45:59.120</a></span> | <span class="t">from what we've learned.

And I'm sure many other factors. So my advice, and you could do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=3011" target="_blank">00:50:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">this very early, is go tour the public school in the district you live in. A lot of public schools</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=3015" target="_blank">00:50:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">will let you go on those tours for new families even earlier. So you can just start to get a sense</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=3019" target="_blank">00:50:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">of it and start talking to parents about it and just kind of figure out what makes sense for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=3024" target="_blank">00:50:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's no definitive answer here.

One, I think going into it with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=3100" target="_blank">00:51:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">the understanding that everything is flexible.

I like having a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=3107" target="_blank">00:51:47.040</a></span> | <span class="t">very clear, structured schedule.

And so being able to kind of put that out of your mind and say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=3117" target="_blank">00:51:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">"Everything is flexible.

Bluey is great, by the way,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=3683" target="_blank">01:01:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">for parents and kids. So I can't imagine there's a parent that hasn't checked out Bluey. But if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=3688" target="_blank">01:01:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">haven't, or even if you're not a parent, I think you'd enjoy it. It is so entertaining. And the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=3692" target="_blank">01:01:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">best part is the shows are all about nine to 10 minutes. So really quick hits, which is really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=3698" target="_blank">01:01:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">nice. So if you say one show, it's nine to 10 minutes, and that's it. A few others we love,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=3703" target="_blank">01:01:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Trash Truck, Lucas the Spider, and Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood, which is kind of a new spin on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=3710" target="_blank">01:01:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Mr. Rogers. Yeah, it's great. Shout out to Kevin Rose, who told us to check out Stillwater,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=3715" target="_blank">01:01:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">which I've put in the newsletter, and I probably talked about on the show. But another really,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=3719" target="_blank">01:01:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">really great show for kids, low stim, lots of like Buddhist principles into life. And honestly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=3727" target="_blank">01:02:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I could just watch that show myself also. And I really love the song that plays in the credits.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=3731" target="_blank">01:02:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But just to be clear, I think these are the shows we like. We try to really limit screen time a lot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=3737" target="_blank">01:02:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Go bananas on screens on an airplane. We're open the floodgates because...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=3742" target="_blank">01:02:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">No rules.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=3743" target="_blank">01:02:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">No rules. We're just trying to survive. But outside of that, I would say we kind of reserve</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=3748" target="_blank">01:02:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">it for a special occasion or maybe on a weekend. But it's certainly not the primary form of things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=3755" target="_blank">01:02:35.520</a></span> | <span class="t">But I'm sure people will have various degrees of opinions on screen time. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=3760" target="_blank">01:02:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">granted, I agree. We did, too. I think every parent I know starts out with, "We're going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=3764" target="_blank">01:02:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">never have screens." And some of them make it there and some don't. But things like that are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=3769" target="_blank">01:02:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">all things that we do when the few times we have screen time off an airplane. And then there's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=3774" target="_blank">01:02:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">handful of apps that we've used. I've talked about Mentava in the past, which is like an accelerated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=3778" target="_blank">01:02:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">learning app that's kind of fun. ABC Mouse has some interesting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=3783" target="_blank">01:03:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">content for kids. Khan Academy has a cool app, but I can't remember what it's called.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=3788" target="_blank">01:03:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think our kids are just starting to get old enough that using an app is fun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=3793" target="_blank">01:03:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Honestly, early on, even a show wasn't interesting. So that was a struggle. We were on a plane ride</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=3797" target="_blank">01:03:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">once and we were trying to get our 18-month-old, "Can't you just be interested in this show and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=3802" target="_blank">01:03:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">stop running around the airplane, please?" And she's like, "No, don't want it." But actually,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=3806" target="_blank">01:03:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">one tip that I thought of on this show, we were trying to let our daughter watch a show on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=3811" target="_blank">01:03:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">plane and we put on a movie of some sort. She wasn't interested. It turns out, she just only</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=3816" target="_blank">01:03:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">had about five minutes of attention for each individual show. And then if we were willing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=3820" target="_blank">01:03:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">to change the show to another show every five minutes, we could hold her attention for longer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=3825" target="_blank">01:03:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that might be a little hack that someone could use. Yeah, that's a great one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=3828" target="_blank">01:03:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I think we hit a lot on parents and children. I like doing these with you. And so I hope we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=3834" target="_blank">01:03:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">can do more. So allthehacks.com/AMA. If you have questions for me, for Amy, for us, we're going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=3840" target="_blank">01:04:00.160</a></span> | <span class="t">try to do these a bit more regularly. This is a lot of fun. Any final thoughts?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=3843" target="_blank">01:04:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">To all the parents out there, we see you.

And to all the parents coming, it might sound hard, but it is so rewarding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqni0mVb9Vo&t=3852" target="_blank">01:04:12.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Thanks so much for listening.
