Some 45% of their patients are from other countries, but they have 300 American board-certified doctors and surgeons in that hospital. That's an anomaly. So, if you're checking on credentials, you know, again, you're doing your own research, you're referring yourself.</p><p>You have to trust that, you know, the University of Birmingham in the U.K. puts out good doctors. On the other hand, in the United States, one out of every seven surgeons is of Indian descent. They were trained in India, and they're now in the United States. And people don't really question that because they have a higher level of comfort when they're in the United States.</p><p>If they knew this exact same doctor was going to treat them in Bangalore or Chennai, they might run 100 miles from that.</p></div></div></body></html>
