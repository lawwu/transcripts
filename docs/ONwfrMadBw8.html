These are not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=81" target="_blank">00:01:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the Von Trapp family singers. We're talking biker bars. We're talking rural interior Alaska</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=87" target="_blank">00:01:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">doing shows. We're talking not so great hotels, right? So she sort of had this rough upbringing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=93" target="_blank">00:01:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a part in her story where she's living in Homer, Alaska, and commuting to her job in town.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">She lived in a cabin by a lake somewhere.

So this is Jewel, this prodigious singer in this really unusual, rough childhood.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=117" target="_blank">00:01:57.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So in the town of Homer, she comes across someone who is visiting from the Interlochen Academy. This</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">is a really well-known arts academy in Michigan, and he recognizes her talent and says, "Look,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">we have scholarships. You should come formally study how to sing at this arts academy. I'll show</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you how to do it. I'll record your audition tape, and I'll walk you through the application process."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.720</a></span> | <span class="t">This was all foreign to Jewel, and he walks her through, and she gets accepted. They raise money</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">in the town. They don't give you money. You have to raise money just to get the plane tickets</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.280</a></span> | <span class="t">to get to Michigan to go. It's a beautiful academy. It's spread out over this big</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">acreage. You sort of walk through the woods between buildings. It's a beautiful place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">She shows up there, fish out of water. It's an understatement. Almost immediately, the dean calls</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">her into his office and says, "Jewel, you can't walk around with a hunting knife strapped to your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">leg." See, to Jewel from rural Alaska, of course, you're going to have a knife with you. It's very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">useful. You wouldn't be anywhere without your knife, and he had to sort of kindly tell her,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">"All right, here in suburban Michigan, you don't walk around with a large knife strapped to your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">leg." Anyways, she gets formal training. She becomes a better singer. She becomes more exposed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">to music. She can't afford to go home during the breaks, so she begins hitchhiking, doing these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">long trips during the breaks with her guitar, and she begins songwriting. She begins to write</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">some songs that become some of her best-known songs from her initial debut album that will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">come much later, right? So we have this interesting story. She makes her way to San Diego. Her mom's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">there. They're living together for a while. They lose the house. She moves into her car. She's not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">doing great, but she has this prodigious talent. It's rough, but this prodigious talent in singing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.360</a></span> | <span class="t">living out of her car in San Diego. She comes across a coffee house, the interchange coffee</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.440</a></span> | <span class="t">house. That coffee house is sort of struggling. She talks to the owner, Nancy, and says, "Look,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">let me make you a deal. I'm going to perform here, just here, me and my guitar, and just give me a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">cut of the proceeds. I think that could help me out, and I think it could help your store actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">grow." So Jewel forms what's essentially a residency at this small coffee house, and she</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">just goes to promote her shows. She busks on the San Diego beachfront. When people come up to hear</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">a player to put a dollar in her guitar case, she says, "Hey, come to my show." The first show,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">her memory is somewhere between two to four people showed up. Two to four surfers she met</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">who thought she was cute on the beach, and they showed up. That was it. But she played her heart</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">out because she had all this pain. I mean, I talk about this in Slow Productivity that Jewel is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">defined by these intertwined forces of talent and pain. She can sing, but there's a real heart to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">it. So she begins doing these epic performances that are like hours long. It's a lot of original</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">songs, some covers. She's really burying her soul. They're emotional. People are crying.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So the word gets out, like, "What the hell? What's going on? There's something special.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">It's rough, but there's something special going on here." She recalls there being basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">exponential growth. There's two people, then four people, then eight people, then 16 people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">After a few months, people are spilling out onto the sidewalk outside of the interchange coffee</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">house. They have to put up speakers outside just so you can hear the show if you can actually get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">in. Word gets out to the record executives, and they start showing up. They're like, "Okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">there's something special here." They begin flying her to meetings, like, "Okay, we want to talk to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you about signing with us because, look, clearly you have talent, and we don't want you to go to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">another record label." Finally, the record executive sits her down. This is where the story is where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">we're going to start to intersect with Slow Productivity here. Sits her down and says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">"Okay, I'm putting this on the table right now, a million-dollar signing bonus." Remember,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=356" target="_blank">00:05:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">this is the '90s, early '90s, a million dollars is a lot of money. Still is today, but even then,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of money. Jewel's living in her car, a million dollars on the table. She's like, "All</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">right, let me go think about this." She's a fighter. She's incredibly self-reliant, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=371" target="_blank">00:06:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">She's like, "Hold on.

She goes to the library and gets out a book from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=377" target="_blank">00:06:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the library about how to succeed.

Such a shrewd sort of practicality in Jewel. She says, "But what we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=528" target="_blank">00:08:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">can do because I know they felt bad." She's turning down a million dollars. She said, "Well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=533" target="_blank">00:08:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">why don't we just make my back end higher?

There is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=865" target="_blank">00:14:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">warmth from the heat generated by the friction of freneticism,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=869" target="_blank">00:14:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">but that warmth doesn't turn into real fires.

Turning down the million dollars and taking your time to figure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=928" target="_blank">00:15:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">out how to be a performer, that's slowing down. So that's the first lesson from Jewel's story.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=933" target="_blank">00:15:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Once you begin prioritizing doing something really well, the only thing that feels natural</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=938" target="_blank">00:15:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">then is being less busy. The focus of quality is the antithesis of freneticism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=951" target="_blank">00:15:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's a second lesson in here as well. So if we return to Jewel, what happens? Well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=956" target="_blank">00:15:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">that album "Pieces of You" is just crazy. She makes a lot of money. How do we know she makes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=962" target="_blank">00:16:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of money? We know because for an unfortunate reason, there's this unfortunate side note to Jewel's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=969" target="_blank">00:16:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">story that her mom comes back into her life and basically takes over as her manager. We've heard</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=976" target="_blank">00:16:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">this story before. This is the Colonel and Elvis. Look, there's nothing here that's that unusual.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=984" target="_blank">00:16:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Anyways, she steals a lot of Jewel's money. She steals a lot of her money. Eventually,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=989" target="_blank">00:16:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a lawsuit. Jewel steals her mom. The only reason why that's relevant to us is in that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=993" target="_blank">00:16:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">lawsuit an amount is named. So we get a sense of how successful Jewel was with these initial albums.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=999" target="_blank">00:16:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">The specific number she cited that her mom stole from her was $200 million.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1003" target="_blank">00:16:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So if it's possible for someone to steal $200 million for you, you're probably doing from a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1011" target="_blank">00:16:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">financial perspective. And again, I'm not an expert on this, but I would say pretty well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1015" target="_blank">00:16:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So she's getting very successful. There's this whole mechanism now that surrounds her.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1020" target="_blank">00:17:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">The better you get at doing something you love, the more the world conspires to try to prevent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1026" target="_blank">00:17:06.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you from doing that thing. That's an axiom that all creatives know. This happens to Jewel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1031" target="_blank">00:17:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So they send her on an international tour, exhausting, a Taylor Swift type thing. She</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1037" target="_blank">00:17:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">comes back from the tour and now her agents are saying, "Okay, you're young and attractive. You</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1045" target="_blank">00:17:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">need to do movies too. So move to Hollywood. Get her in the Devil's Backbone and Ang Lee movie.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1051" target="_blank">00:17:31.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's the plan. Move to LA. We're going to do international tour movies. International</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1055" target="_blank">00:17:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">tour movies. You're going to be a multimedia mogul star." And Jewel says, "Well, wait a second. What</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1062" target="_blank">00:17:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">do I want to do? I want to produce great music. I don't worry about money. I have plenty of money.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1066" target="_blank">00:17:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to produce great music." "No, thank you." Never does an international tour again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1072" target="_blank">00:17:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">leaves the movie business, does not settle in LA, goes to a ranch in Texas with her boyfriend,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1078" target="_blank">00:17:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">who was a rodeo rider, and just writes music. So there's another lesson in there. And again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1085" target="_blank">00:18:05.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm trying to parabolize this and the lessons are going to be relevant to us who are not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1088" target="_blank">00:18:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">really fancy and successful movie stars. The lesson here is that by getting really good at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1095" target="_blank">00:18:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">something, Jewel was able to gain autonomy over what her work was like. So getting good at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1101" target="_blank">00:18:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">something enables slowness. So as you quest to get good, lesson number one, you crave slowness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1108" target="_blank">00:18:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">As you get better at things, lesson number two, you gain the autonomy to actually enforce more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1113" target="_blank">00:18:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">slowness in your life. Jewel is a very successful musician, so she could basically say, "No,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1118" target="_blank">00:18:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't want to do this other stuff. I just want to write music. I have enough money. I have enough</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1123" target="_blank">00:18:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">F.U. money to say, 'No, I'm going to shape what my life is like,' and I want it to be slow."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1130" target="_blank">00:18:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So we've got these great two lessons in here. Quality makes slowness something that is necessary</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1137" target="_blank">00:18:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and appealing. The pursuit of quality also eventually makes slowness something that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1141" target="_blank">00:19:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">can more easily enforce or maintain in your life. So we have a virtuous flywheel here. It's why I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1147" target="_blank">00:19:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">call this last principle, obsess over quality, the glue that holds all the other principles of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1152" target="_blank">00:19:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">slow productivity together, because it makes the other ideas possible. The other ideas are about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1158" target="_blank">00:19:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">doing fewer things and working at a more natural pace. The obsession over quality</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1162" target="_blank">00:19:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">really makes that much more possible. All right, so let's try to apply this to a normal knowledge</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1168" target="_blank">00:19:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">work job. What is the template we want to apply if you're a marketing director or a programmer and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1175" target="_blank">00:19:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">not a music superstar? Well, think about it this way. One, figure out what you do best</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1183" target="_blank">00:19:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">or what you could do that's going to be the most valuable for your sector or organization.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1190" target="_blank">00:19:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">We often skip over this step, but it's really hard sometimes to figure out what really matters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1196" target="_blank">00:19:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">What is our equivalent of Jewel's performance singing ability?

And then once we find up, we have to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1208" target="_blank">00:20:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">create our equivalent of Jewel's training regime. She spent a year and a half on the road figuring</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1212" target="_blank">00:20:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">out, "How do I perform? How do I find my voice? What is my voice? How do I translate what I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1219" target="_blank">00:20:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">doing in the interchange coffeehouse into something that translates to a CD that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1223" target="_blank">00:20:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">going to MTV? I'm going to work on that craft." Well, you have to have a similar training regime</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1228" target="_blank">00:20:28.560</a></span> | <span class="t">where you haven't just identified, "Here's what matters in my job," but you know how you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1232" target="_blank">00:20:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">getting after that, how you're improving that. And then three, as you get more successful,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1237" target="_blank">00:20:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">cash that in to gain more autonomy over your work so that you can have whatever level or definition</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1242" target="_blank">00:20:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">of slowness appeals to you. So you can step away from busyness and keep your work crafted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1248" target="_blank">00:20:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">around the things that really resonate. That's hard as well. That's hard as well because,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1255" target="_blank">00:20:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">well, as you get better, people aren't going to be offering you to do less.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1260" target="_blank">00:21:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you're going to have to actually make that call yourself.

I'm going to do this sort of leaning into evidence-based in this example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1327" target="_blank">00:22:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Now you have to use that success to gain autonomy. So now imagine you say, "Okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1332" target="_blank">00:22:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm really desirable in this sector. I'm leaving my company to go freelance. You can hire me to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1336" target="_blank">00:22:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">run the marketing for your particular whatever it is, product or launch or whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1341" target="_blank">00:22:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm going to charge a good amount of money because I'm really good at this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1346" target="_blank">00:22:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I can back it up and I'm going to do this eight months a year. Four months a year,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1350" target="_blank">00:22:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't take contracts. That's just the deal. So if your contract overlaps those four months,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1355" target="_blank">00:22:35.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I just can't do it." Imagine that now. Now you've created this really nice sort of slow rhythm where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1362" target="_blank">00:22:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">you're doing great work. You have four months a year, you're not working at all. I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1365" target="_blank">00:22:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you could just imagine in this daydream here how you've escaped just being like a lower-level</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1370" target="_blank">00:22:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">marketing director that they don't really trust.

All right, what about if you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1377" target="_blank">00:22:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">a programmer? Let's give another concrete example here. Maybe you really look around and say, "Oh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1382" target="_blank">00:23:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">this particular specialty is incredibly valuable right now." Maybe it's like API development for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1389" target="_blank">00:23:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">platforms, or maybe it's something in the AI space, like you're very comfortable</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1396" target="_blank">00:23:16.640</a></span> | <span class="t">working with the ML libraries for Google. I'm very comfortable working with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1403" target="_blank">00:23:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">doing efficient training code for neural nets or something like that. You figure out like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1410" target="_blank">00:23:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">"This is the thing that's really valuable. We don't have a good person for this. These people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1414" target="_blank">00:23:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">are really desirable." And you just work an hour a day. You train yourself. You read and do sample</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1420" target="_blank">00:23:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">projects. You're just doing this, forcing yourself to get better and better and better at this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1426" target="_blank">00:23:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And as you get better and better, you eventually be considered a 10X programmer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1431" target="_blank">00:23:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Your salary jumps up.

I do one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1438" target="_blank">00:23:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">project at a time. I take sabbaticals every three years.

Those are just some concrete examples of what I'm trying to show you here is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1450" target="_blank">00:24:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">this dual strategy of figuring out what matters, systematically pursuing it, leveraging success to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1457" target="_blank">00:24:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">gain autonomy and to move away from busyness and towards something more meaningful really can apply</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1462" target="_blank">00:24:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">to many different jobs. All right. So what are the pitfalls here that you want to avoid? I have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1465" target="_blank">00:24:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">three real quick I want to mention. This first one actually came up in my conversation with Ryan</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1471" target="_blank">00:24:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Holiday when I did his podcast recently to talk about slow productivity because it was actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1476" target="_blank">00:24:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">an idea of his that we sort of riffed on. And this was this idea of you want to make sure that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1481" target="_blank">00:24:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">you're not playing the wrong game. So one of the biggest pitfalls is like, look, I want to do really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1487" target="_blank">00:24:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">well, but you're doing well at the wrong game. And the example he gave, which I think is a good one,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1492" target="_blank">00:24:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">is focusing on pleasing over impressing. And he said, OK, here's what I want to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1498" target="_blank">00:24:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">is I'm going to be super responsive. Like I make everyone else's life easier. You need something,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1504" target="_blank">00:25:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll do it. Even if I have to stay up late, I'll answer your emails right away.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1507" target="_blank">00:25:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Like my job is to reduce stress in everybody else's life. And people will love you for that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1512" target="_blank">00:25:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">But they won't respect you for that. You're not going to gain yourself autonomy or leverage doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1518" target="_blank">00:25:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">that. You're going to you're going to gain yourself a lot more work. Now, consider the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1522" target="_blank">00:25:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">other game to play, which is I want to impress all these people. It's not impressive to be super</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1527" target="_blank">00:25:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">responsive and to do what it takes to get these small things done. It's not impressive. It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1532" target="_blank">00:25:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">useful to them. Impressive is I can program these transformer matrix manipulations for this AI thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1539" target="_blank">00:25:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">better than anyone else, you know, and it gives us a 10x speed up in the training when I do it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1544" target="_blank">00:25:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">when I'm on the team and I'm like fine with email. I'm kind of you know, I'm not like a jerk about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1549" target="_blank">00:25:49.760</a></span> | <span class="t">it, but I'm I'm not like great at the small things you give me, but I can do this really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1553" target="_blank">00:25:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">well. And that's really impressive. That is much more valuable. Playing the game of being</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1557" target="_blank">00:25:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">impressive instead of playing the game of pleasing people. Pitfall number two has to do with the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1564" target="_blank">00:26:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">training aspect. Right? So these pitfalls, by the way, correspond to the three part lessons of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1572" target="_blank">00:26:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">first part was figure out what you do best. Playing the wrong game is a pitfall about getting that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1576" target="_blank">00:26:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">wrong. The second part of our three step system was create a training regime. So the pitfall here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1581" target="_blank">00:26:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">is what I call going on fun runs instead of interval training. Right? So like when people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1586" target="_blank">00:26:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">want to become a better runner, they're amateur runners, they want to just like go for 5k runs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1592" target="_blank">00:26:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and blast music and kind of like go fast at the end and work up a sweat, but never really do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1596" target="_blank">00:26:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">anything that hard. Right? Whereas like serious runners like no, no, no, I'm either doing 10 mile</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1601" target="_blank">00:26:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">runs to build up my aerobic base, or I'm doing vomit inducing intervals to get my speed up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1606" target="_blank">00:26:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not fun. Right? The professional runners are doing the stuff you really need to do to get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1611" target="_blank">00:26:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">better. The amateur runners are doing the stuff that they they want to do. So they kind of tell</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1615" target="_blank">00:26:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the story that that's what's important. Same thing happens with knowledge or professional skills all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1619" target="_blank">00:26:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">the time. We write a story about what we want to do, because we like the idea of like, I spent 30</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1625" target="_blank">00:27:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">minutes doing this you to me course on programming every day, I can find time for it. It's not too</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1630" target="_blank">00:27:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">hard, but it makes me feel productive. We write stories about what we want to be important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1635" target="_blank">00:27:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Instead of figuring out the things that actually matter. And almost always the things that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1640" target="_blank">00:27:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">actually matter aren't fun, you have to learn to actually get the pleasure out of doing the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1643" target="_blank">00:27:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">hard thing other people won't do. Athletes know this. You have to you have to alchemize</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1649" target="_blank">00:27:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">intense discomfort of certain training, I can't understand this math, but I'm going to crack it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1655" target="_blank">00:27:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">alchemize that into fulfillment.

I'm not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1659" target="_blank">00:27:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not going to give up here. All right, the third pitfall here. So when it comes to using</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1666" target="_blank">00:27:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">success to gain more autonomy, the pitfall here is what I call the control trap. This was in my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=1670" target="_blank">00:27:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">book so good, they can't ignore you.

And they might end up being like, "Okay, fine. These are better." Maybe you didn't need to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=2159" target="_blank">00:35:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">doing seven to eight.

And I think this could be better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=2248" target="_blank">00:37:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.

All right. Our next question comes from Evan. Evan says, I'm in the early stages of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=2296" target="_blank">00:38:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">my career and realized that a disproportionate amount of success in the corporate world depends</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=2302" target="_blank">00:38:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">on your ability to sell yourself. I've seen competent, quiet managers get fired while</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=2308" target="_blank">00:38:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">talking heads get steadily promoted. How do I sell my skills better? And if needed interview better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=2315" target="_blank">00:38:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, Evan, this is a key place where I want to bring up one of the pitfalls that we discussed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=2321" target="_blank">00:38:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">when talking about the story of Jewel in the deep dive, which was the fun run versus interval</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=2326" target="_blank">00:38:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">training pitfall, which says the key here is to not to write your own story about what matters,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=2334" target="_blank">00:38:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">but to learn what actually does matter. All right. So it's very tempting in this type of situation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=2340" target="_blank">00:39:00.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to come up with what you want to be important. This is what I want to work on. And if I do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=2345" target="_blank">00:39:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">this, then I'm going to get more notice. I'm going to be more successful because I like the sound of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=2349" target="_blank">00:39:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">it. I like the sound of it. It's tractable. It's not too hard, but it sounds good. No,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=2357" target="_blank">00:39:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">you need to go figure out for the people who are good at what you see as being needed for success</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=2361" target="_blank">00:39:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">to people who are good, who are getting steadily promoted. What specifically are they doing that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=2365" target="_blank">00:39:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">matters? This might mean actually talking to them. I want to learn from you. How did you get this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=2370" target="_blank">00:39:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">promotion? What about this one? What was key? What were you doing that other people who are up for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=2374" target="_blank">00:39:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">that promotion didn't do? Learn what really matters. You might discover, for example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=2380" target="_blank">00:39:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">that actually it's not about them selling themselves. Like maybe it turns out, and I've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=2385" target="_blank">00:39:45.840</a></span> | <span class="t">been down this road before in my own life, where I thought it was a marketing thing mattered.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=2389" target="_blank">00:39:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And it turned out like, no, actually the thing they were doing was just better than what I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=2392" target="_blank">00:39:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">doing. So it might turn out, oh, this is the skill that really matters. It's very hard. I'm doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=2396" target="_blank">00:39:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">that. Okay. They're doing it better. This is not about them selling themselves, or maybe it is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=2400" target="_blank">00:40:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">about selling themselves, but you learn out what that means. What aspect of selling themselves</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=2406" target="_blank">00:40:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is it that in the end really matters? So you've got to get to the bottom of what matters. Don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=2410" target="_blank">00:40:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">write your own story. And then you can decide, do I want to do that or not? And if so, what's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=2414" target="_blank">00:40:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">my training regime? And let's get after it systematically head down relentlessly. And if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=2418" target="_blank">00:40:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">not, at least, you know, why not? Oh, this is harder or requires sacrifices that I'm not right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=2422" target="_blank">00:40:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">now willing to make. And by the way, that second answer is fine as well. So there's a technological</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=2428" target="_blank">00:40:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">piece to this because a lot of people have this sense about social media promotion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=2431" target="_blank">00:40:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I think what matters is that professor, that manager, that writer, it's what they're doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=2437" target="_blank">00:40:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">on social media that matters. So maybe I need to do more of that. If I just did more of that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=2442" target="_blank">00:40:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I'd be more successful, right? It's a common story that we tell ourselves when we're looking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=2447" target="_blank">00:40:47.040</a></span> | <span class="t">at self-promotion and success. But when you dig deep in a lot of these cases, it turns out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=2450" target="_blank">00:40:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">it's not the key. The key is what they're doing is good. They're doing something different. They</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=2454" target="_blank">00:40:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">got lucky, you know? So anyways, reality is more complicated. You got to actually confront the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=2461" target="_blank">00:41:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">reality. Let's move on here. We got Mike. Mike says, I'm an animator and I have good productivity</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=2468" target="_blank">00:41:08.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and focus in the office. However, I struggle to work on my personal projects at home. I only do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=2474" target="_blank">00:41:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">tasks that have the least resistance, such as organizing files instead of doing the actual work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=2479" target="_blank">00:41:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">How can I do the hard tasks for my personal projects? Well, Mike, first of all,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=2486" target="_blank">00:41:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">the stuff you're mentioning as least resistant, such as organizing files, maybe this is not so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=2492" target="_blank">00:41:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">unimportant.

Also, you might consider just doing fewer projects</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=2517" target="_blank">00:41:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and making the projects you do better. So when it comes to personal projects,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=2520" target="_blank">00:42:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a couple of reasons why you might not be coming back to them.

And you don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=2535" target="_blank">00:42:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">really love the idea. You're not that excited about it. And you're tired because you have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=2538" target="_blank">00:42:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">hard job and you're trying to take care of your house and maybe your family and that limited</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=2542" target="_blank">00:42:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">time and energy. If it's a project you don't love, your mind might say no moss.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=2545" target="_blank">00:42:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">See what I did there? That was Spanish. Here's the other problem. Maybe you do love the project,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=2551" target="_blank">00:42:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">but your plan stinks.

And so like, why don't,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=2557" target="_blank">00:42:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">why am I just not going down to my writing room and writing? Because your mind says that's just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=2560" target="_blank">00:42:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">not, that's not enough.

And so when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=2572" target="_blank">00:42:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">you're saying maybe I should go spend some hours writing at the library, whatever your brain says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=2576" target="_blank">00:42:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">let's organize the files.

So maybe you need fewer projects and the projects you choose need to be better,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=2586" target="_blank">00:43:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">but also just ease up.

That's the new version. His version, Sidney Lumet's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=3518" target="_blank">00:58:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">version is from the 1970s as Sean Connery is in it. I also went back and I'd never seen before</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=3524" target="_blank">00:58:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Dog Day Afternoon, which I really enjoyed. It's a fantastic movie, but cool book because basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=3529" target="_blank">00:58:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">each chapter is a different part of the movie production process and he gets into it.

If you're a cinephile or you like movies, you sort of have to read this book. I kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=3544" target="_blank">00:59:04.240</a></span> | <span class="t">embarrassed it took me this long, but I'm glad I got to it.

So each year I try,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=3556" target="_blank">00:59:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">my wife and I try to watch all of the movies nominated for best picture. There's 10 of them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=3562" target="_blank">00:59:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">now, so it could be hard, but this year we succeeded. We saw all 10. After we watched</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=3566" target="_blank">00:59:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Killers of the Flower Moon, I wanted to read the book because I had some questions about what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=3570" target="_blank">00:59:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">happened in the movie.

It wasn't as powerful of an apology as I expected. It was fine. It's a short book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=3616" target="_blank">01:00:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Smart writer, but it's not punching the gut apology, so maybe worth passing on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=3622" target="_blank">01:00:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Finally, I read The Good Shepherd by C.S.

And then you make it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONwfrMadBw8&t=3728" target="_blank">01:02:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">through the other side, you get a sigh of relief.
