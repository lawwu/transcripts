target="_blank">00:08:36.120</a></span> | <span class="t">so there are deterministic agents generative agents and obviously kind of hybrid agents</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0qemluQDtQ&t=522" target="_blank">00:08:42.680</a></span> | <span class="t">deterministic agents are basically following a fixed set of rules or algorithms to make decisions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0qemluQDtQ&t=529" target="_blank">00:08:49.560</a></span> | <span class="t">so given a specific input that type of agent is always consistently going to return the same output</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0qemluQDtQ&t=536" target="_blank">00:08:56.360</a></span> | <span class="t">so I'm sure you can tell this is quite different from when you're say prompting with a generative agent</span></div><div class="c"><span

give it the input of two plus two it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0qemluQDtQ&t=551" target="_blank">00:09:11.080</a></span> | <span

use cases</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0qemluQDtQ&t=567" target="_blank">00:09:27.400</a></span> | <span class="t">where you want to be creative

about your company's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0qemluQDtQ&t=599" target="_blank">00:09:59.080</a></span> | <span class="t">products etc and

design agents which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0qemluQDtQ&t=703" target="_blank">00:11:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is multi-agent

let's say there's three levels of agent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0qemluQDtQ&t=722" target="_blank">00:12:02.280</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0qemluQDtQ&t=795" target="_blank">00:13:15.240</a></span> | <span class="t">give like show you really quickly like what a set of use cases for agents could look like so with customer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0qemluQDtQ&t=802" target="_blank">00:13:22.440</a></span> | <span class="t">i already talked

target="_blank">00:13:27.400</a></span> | <span class="t">but also things like e-commerce being able to support b2b supporting travel if you are a travel vendor</span></div><div class="c"><span

target="_blank">00:13:50.040</a></span> | <span class="t">so those are kind of thinking about who the agent is targeted to and then knowledge agents</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0qemluQDtQ&t=835" target="_blank">00:13:55.160</a></span> | <span class="t">are specialized agents in terms of what exactly is their subject matter of expertise so you could have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0qemluQDtQ&t=842" target="_blank">00:14:02.600</a></span> | <span class="t">an agent that's

target="_blank">00:14:06.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and then finally we are also seeing through the use of multimodal use cases a huge uptick in voice agents</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0qemluQDtQ&t=856" target="_blank">00:14:16.520</a></span> | <span class="t">especially in scenarios like say a fast food drive-through so i'm sure

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0qemluQDtQ&t=887" target="_blank">00:14:47.880</a></span> | <span class="t">talk about what what the kind of components of agents are then we thought through
