target="_blank">00:01:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">though not quite as ambiguous.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34n9yMYIRCM&t=70"

target="_blank">00:01:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In the first 15 verses of Ephesians, Paul laid out the magnificent saving work of God from eternity to eternity,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34n9yMYIRCM&t=86" target="_blank">00:01:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and then in verse 15 or 16, he turns from theology to prayer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34n9yMYIRCM&t=93" target="_blank">00:01:33.500</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a beautiful example of how we need both theology, verses 1 to 15,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34n9yMYIRCM&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and then divine, supernatural, spiritual illumination in verses 16 to the end of chapter 1.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34n9yMYIRCM&t=104" target="_blank">00:01:44.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Just a beautiful example of how to go about seeing and savoring the glories of God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34n9yMYIRCM&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So here's the key text that she's referring to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34n9yMYIRCM&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Start at verse 17.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34n9yMYIRCM&t=114" target="_blank">00:01:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"I pray that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you a spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of Him,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34n9yMYIRCM&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">having the eyes of your hearts enlightened, that you may know..."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34n9yMYIRCM&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then he mentions three things, and she's asking about the second one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34n9yMYIRCM&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">One, "What is the hope to which He has called you?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34n9yMYIRCM&t=138" target="_blank">00:02:18.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Or literally, "What is the hope of His calling?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34n9yMYIRCM&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Two, "What are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34n9yMYIRCM&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And three, "What is the immeasurable greatness of His power toward us who believe according to the working of His great might?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34n9yMYIRCM&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's Ephesians 1, 17 to 19.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34n9yMYIRCM&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And Christina's question is, "What does this phrase mean?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34n9yMYIRCM&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"The riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34n9yMYIRCM&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Does it mean that God inherits us, the saints, or does it mean that we, the saints, will have an inheritance from God?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34n9yMYIRCM&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think the correct interpretation is the second one,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34n9yMYIRCM&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.500</a></span> | <span class="t">namely, the inheritance is given by God and is in or among the saints.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34n9yMYIRCM&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.500</a></span> | <span class="t">We receive it into our midst and in our hearts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34n9yMYIRCM&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think, Paul, means that God gets us as an inheritance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34n9yMYIRCM&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And there are at least four reasons why I think this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34n9yMYIRCM&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Number one, Paul is praying that the saints would have the eyes of their heart enlightened to grasp the majesty and glory and riches and wonder of the things he's been talking about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34n9yMYIRCM&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And just before the prayer, we read this, "In Him, you were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34n9yMYIRCM&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">who is the guarantee of our inheritance until we acquire possession of it to the praise of His glory."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34n9yMYIRCM&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.500</a></span> | <span class="t">That's verse 14, just before the prayer begins.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34n9yMYIRCM&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So the most immediately near reference to an inheritance is not God getting one, but giving one to us for His glory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34n9yMYIRCM&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think it would be natural to think that's what he's praying about, that we would grasp that inheritance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34n9yMYIRCM&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Number two, second reason for thinking it's God giving an inheritance rather than getting one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34n9yMYIRCM&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If we look at what comes later as a possible help and filling in of a description of what the inheritance is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34n9yMYIRCM&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think we find it in chapter 2, verse 6 and 7.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34n9yMYIRCM&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">See if you don't think so.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34n9yMYIRCM&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"He raised us up with Him and seated us with Him, with Christ, in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34n9yMYIRCM&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">so that in the coming ages He might show the immeasurable riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34n9yMYIRCM&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So what he calls the riches of the glory of His inheritance in verse 18 of chapter 1,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34n9yMYIRCM&t=305" target="_blank">00:05:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think he describes in chapter 2, verse 7 as the immeasurable riches of His grace in kindness toward us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34n9yMYIRCM&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In other words, the riches of the glory of the inheritance is what He gives us, not what He gets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34n9yMYIRCM&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Third reason.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34n9yMYIRCM&t=322" target="_blank">00:05:22.500</a></span> | <span class="t">If we focus on the three specific realities that Paul wants us to see with the eyes of the heart and grasp in a profound way,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34n9yMYIRCM&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.500</a></span> | <span class="t">it turns out that he uses the very same wording with regard to each of them as to whether they come from God or go toward God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34n9yMYIRCM&t=345" target="_blank">00:05:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">For example, the hope—he wants us to see the hope of His calling, 2) the glory of His inheritance, 3) the greatness of His power.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34n9yMYIRCM&t=358" target="_blank">00:05:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now that's a significant level of symmetry or of parallel, and I think it would be really strange if the modifier "His" had a different meaning in regard to the inheritance than it has in regard to the calling and the power.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34n9yMYIRCM&t=377" target="_blank">00:06:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's His calling in the sense that He gives it, it's His power in the sense that He has it and gives it, and it's His inheritance in the sense that He gives it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34n9yMYIRCM&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.500</a></span> | <span class="t">That's argument number three.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34n9yMYIRCM&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And finally, if you do a word study and look up all the places, which I did, where Paul uses the word "inheritance" or "inherit" or "heir,"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34n9yMYIRCM&t=402" target="_blank">00:06:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">we find that in all of Paul's uses of these words, they never refer to God inheriting or God's receiving an inheritance or God's being an heir.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34n9yMYIRCM&t=414" target="_blank">00:06:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I conclude that Paul, in Ephesians 1.18, is talking about the riches of the glory of the inheritance God has laid up for the saints.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34n9yMYIRCM&t=430" target="_blank">00:07:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now before I stop, of course it's not false that the church is God's treasured possession, and He will rejoice over us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34n9yMYIRCM&t=442" target="_blank">00:07:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Indeed, that spectacular experience may well be part of the inheritance He gives to us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34n9yMYIRCM&t=452"
