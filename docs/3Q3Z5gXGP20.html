And that is pretty popular in the Bay Area,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q3Z5gXGP20&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">where most listings are getting several offers on all of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q3Z5gXGP20&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, actually, I have bought 2 homes in the Bay Area and both times I've used the seller's agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q3Z5gXGP20&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So we can talk about that a little bit more because I have some thoughts about it.

You got to pick the right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q3Z5gXGP20&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">one." Obviously, not everyone lives in the Bay Area. So you're not going to be the perfect agent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q3Z5gXGP20&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">for everyone.

A lot of agents don't. In fact,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q3Z5gXGP20&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">most agents don't. I'd say 90% of agents sell a couple houses a year or less.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q3Z5gXGP20&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's unpopular to say this. The agents get angry because they're offended right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q3Z5gXGP20&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">"Just because I only sell 2 houses a year doesn't mean I'm not good." Okay, I know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q3Z5gXGP20&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">However, tell me anything that you do twice a year that you get really, really good at.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q3Z5gXGP20&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">In general, that's how life works. If you snowboard twice a year for your whole life,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q3Z5gXGP20&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">you never really get that good at snowboarding. Or it takes you 20 years before you're as good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q3Z5gXGP20&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">as somebody that just snowboarded every weekend for the whole first year that they got into it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q3Z5gXGP20&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Repetition really does develop mastery. I talk about that in the Burr book that I wrote.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q3Z5gXGP20&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first thing I look for is an agent that sells a lot of homes, period. The next thing I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q3Z5gXGP20&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">want is an agent that owns real estate themselves. At minimum, they got to own their own house. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q3Z5gXGP20&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">ideally, I want them to own investment property. It gives a completely different perspective</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q3Z5gXGP20&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">when you've bought a home and you believe in it. And you just get a different set of goggles to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q3Z5gXGP20&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">look at real estate through. I don't have any kids. I love kids. We were talking about that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q3Z5gXGP20&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">before the show. But each of you as a dad, I am sure, sees something different when you look at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q3Z5gXGP20&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">a kid than I do.

They can recognize that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q3Z5gXGP20&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">a bad neighborhood. That's not the right tenant. That's not the right floor plan. That's not the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q3Z5gXGP20&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">right structure. You really want to go to this house that may not look as pretty in the pictures,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q3Z5gXGP20&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">but will be a better deal. The third thing that you want to look for is an agent that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q3Z5gXGP20&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">understands the financial component of real estate. Many real estate agents are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q3Z5gXGP20&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">geared to cater to their clients' emotions.

This is how they make their money by being</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q3Z5gXGP20&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">likable. Most people reach out to the agent who's the nicest, the friendliest, the warmest. That</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q3Z5gXGP20&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">doesn't mean they're the smartest.
