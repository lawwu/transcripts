target="_blank">00:01:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that the challenge has been finding those businesses where that's true in a sustainable fashion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7gM19hphRk&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When you get into entertainment-style things, you could be the cat's

target="_blank">00:02:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just super hard to do so.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7gM19hphRk&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's just a tough business.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7gM19hphRk&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's been a lot of experimentation around what is the right type of social companion?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7gM19hphRk&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What is the right robot in the home that is doing something other than tasks people do every week that they'd rather not do?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7gM19hphRk&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm not sure we've got it all figured out right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7gM19hphRk&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that you get brilliant roboticists with super interesting robots that ultimately don't quite have that magical user experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7gM19hphRk&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And thus, that value-benefit equation remains ambiguous.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7gM19hphRk&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you as somebody who dreams of robots changing the world, what's your estimate?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7gM19hphRk&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">How big is the space of applications that fit the criteria that you just described,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7gM19hphRk&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">where you can really demonstrate an obvious significant value over the alternative non-robotic solution?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7gM19hphRk&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I think that we're just about none of the way to achieving the potential of robotics at home.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7gM19hphRk&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But we have to do it in a really eyes wide open, honest fashion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7gM19hphRk&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Another way to put that is the potential is infinite.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7gM19hphRk&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because we did take a few steps, but you're saying those steps are just very initial steps.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7gM19hphRk&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So Darumba is a hugely successful product, but you're saying that's just the very, very beginning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7gM19hphRk&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's just the very, very beginning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7gM19hphRk&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's the foot in the door.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7gM19hphRk&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think I was lucky that in the early days of robotics, people would ask me, "When are you going to clean my floor?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7gM19hphRk&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It was something that I grew up saying, "I got all these really good ideas, but everyone seems to want their floor clean."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7gM19hphRk&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so maybe we should do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7gM19hphRk&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, your good ideas.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7gM19hphRk&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Earn the right to do the next thing after that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7gM19hphRk&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the good ideas have to match with the desire of the people, and then the actual cost has to, like, the financial aspect has to all match together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7gM19hphRk&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, during our partnership back a number of years ago with Johnson Wax, they would explain to me that they would go into homes and just watch how people lived.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7gM19hphRk&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And try to figure out, what were they doing that they really didn't really like to do, but they had to do it frequently enough that it was top of mind and understood as a burden?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7gM19hphRk&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Hey, let's make a product or come up with a solution to make that pain point less challenging.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7gM19hphRk&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And sometimes we do certain burdens so often as a society that we actually don't even realize, like, it's actually hard to see that that burden is something that could be removed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7gM19hphRk&t=348" target="_blank">00:05:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it does require just going into the home and staring at, "How do I actually live life? What are the pain points?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7gM19hphRk&t=356" target="_blank">00:05:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, and getting those insights is a lot harder than it would seem it should be in retrospect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7gM19hphRk&t=364" target="_blank">00:06:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So how hard on that point, I mean, one of the big challenges of robotics is driving the cost down to something that consumers, people would afford.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7gM19hphRk&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So people would be less likely to buy Arumba if it costs $500,000, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7gM19hphRk&t=387" target="_blank">00:06:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Which is probably sort of what Arumba would cost several decades ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7gM19hphRk&t=393" target="_blank">00:06:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So how do you drive, which I mentioned is very difficult, how do you drive the cost of Arumba or a robot down such that people would want to buy it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7gM19hphRk&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When I started building robots, the cost of the robot had a lot to do with the amount of time it took to build it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7gM19hphRk&t=411" target="_blank">00:06:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that we would build our robots out of aluminum, I would go spend my time in the machine shop on the milling machine, cutting out the parts and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7gM19hphRk&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then when we got into the toy industry, I realized that if we were building at scale, I could determine the cost of the robot instead of adding up all the hours to mill out the parts, but by weighing it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7gM19hphRk&t=437" target="_blank">00:07:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's liberating. You can say, "Wow, the world has just changed as I think about construction in a different way."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7gM19hphRk&t=448" target="_blank">00:07:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The 3D CAD tools that are available to us today, the operating at scale where I can do tooling and injection mold, an arbitrarily complicated part.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7gM19hphRk&t=462" target="_blank">00:07:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the cost is going to be basically the weight of the plastic in that part is incredibly exciting and liberating and opens up all sorts of opportunities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7gM19hphRk&t=474" target="_blank">00:07:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And for the sensing part of it, where we are today is instead of trying to build skin, which is really hard. For a long time, I spent creating strategies and ideas around how could we duplicate the skin on the human body because it's such an amazing sensor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7gM19hphRk&t=501" target="_blank">00:08:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Instead of going down that path, why don't we focus on vision and how many of the problems that face a robot trying to do real work could be solved with a cheap camera and a big ass computer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7gM19hphRk&t=524" target="_blank">00:08:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And Moore's Law continues to work. The cell phone industry, the mobile industry is giving us better and better tools that can run on these embedded computers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7gM19hphRk&t=536" target="_blank">00:08:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think we passed an important moment maybe two years ago where you could put machine vision capable processors on robots at consumer price points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7gM19hphRk&t=555" target="_blank">00:09:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was waiting for it to happen. We avoided putting lasers on our robots to do navigation and instead spent years researching how to do vision based navigation because you could just see where these technology trends were going.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7gM19hphRk&t=577" target="_blank">00:09:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And between injection molded plastic and a camera with a computer capable of running machine learning and visual object recognition, I could build an incredibly affordable, incredibly capable robot and that's going to be the future.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7gM19hphRk&t=596" target="_blank">00:09:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">[ Silence ]</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7gM19hphRk&t=606" target="_blank">00:10:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">[ Silence ]</span></div></div></body></html>
