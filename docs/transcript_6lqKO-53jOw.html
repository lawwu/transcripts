Now, in a perfect world, I'd go for two or three days. We go to the mountains or whatever.</p><p>And I got little kids at home. I got a two year old and six year old. So right now that's not happening, but we'll get out for a day and we will work together on where we want to be as a couple. And that starts with a reflection on your past.</p><p>Like, where were we last year? Where do we struggle? What are we doing right? What are we doing wrong? And then where do we want to be? So we do that in our marriage. We set goals together every year. We visit them every quarter. I have a sheet hung up on my bathroom mirror that has our goals for the year, as well as spots for checking off.</p><p>And I'm not very good at checking, honestly, with this. I wish I checked it every single day. All the habits that are going to give us a better marriage. But we at least have it in the mirror every single day when I open up my toothbrush. Just being intentional, doing the things that we do in business and applying them to our personal life, that has made such a difference on the relationship side.</p></div></div></body></html>
