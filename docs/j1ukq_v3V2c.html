And there's some other factors that might apply. So here's my rule of thumb.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=806" target="_blank">00:13:26.740</a></span> | <span class="t">If the debt isn't tax deductible, right?

So I think you should look at the interest rates on,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=822" target="_blank">00:13:42.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll call it like a tax adjusted basis, right? If you have a 6% mortgage,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=826" target="_blank">00:13:46.460</a></span> | <span class="t">mortgage, but that mortgage interest is tax deductible, and you live in a high tax state,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=830" target="_blank">00:13:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and you make a lot of money, it might really be more like 3% or 4%.

Meaning if you have an investment that is down below the price you paid, you can sell</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=1275" target="_blank">00:21:15.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that investment and capture those losses and use them to offset other gains, whether it's long or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=1281" target="_blank">00:21:21.180</a></span> | <span class="t">short-term gains, or you can offset up to $3,000 of income a year.

And understand that if you were to ever leave that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=1557" target="_blank">00:25:57.260</a></span> | <span class="t">brokerage firm, you know, you would be stuck with 500 individual stocks, if you were trying to match</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=1561" target="_blank">00:26:01.740</a></span> | <span class="t">the S&P 500. The advantage of doing this is you can tax loss harvest at the security level instead of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=1568" target="_blank">00:26:08.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the fund level. So on any given day, it's not that likely that the S&P 500 is down, because typically it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=1574" target="_blank">00:26:14.900</a></span> | <span class="t">goes up over time. But any individual security, I would go out and say that almost any day, one of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=1580" target="_blank">00:26:20.540</a></span> | <span class="t">shares of the S&P 500, one of the securities there has gone down. And so it gives you the advantage of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=1585" target="_blank">00:26:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">more tax loss harvesting opportunities. Another thing you can look at is asset location, which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=1590" target="_blank">00:26:30.980</a></span> | <span class="t">would be to take really tax efficient investments and put them in your taxable brokerage account,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=1594" target="_blank">00:26:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">put really tax inefficient investments in your tax advantage retirement accounts, and view your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=1600" target="_blank">00:26:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">portfolio across all of your different accounts. I find that this is really hard to manage and there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=1605" target="_blank">00:26:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">aren't any automated solutions I'm aware of to do it.

You're not constrained by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=1617" target="_blank">00:26:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">any limits or penalties.

And it's something you can keep adding to constantly as your income grows. In many ways,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=1625" target="_blank">00:27:05.540</a></span> | <span class="t">your taxable brokerage account kind of becomes your future freedom fund.

Next, before we get to the final step, I want to talk about education</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=1640" target="_blank">00:27:20.040</a></span> | <span class="t">investing and specifically where I think 529 plans fit into this framework to save for the cost of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=1645" target="_blank">00:27:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">college for your children or maybe yourself. Here's my general philosophy. You shouldn't put your child's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=1651" target="_blank">00:27:31.740</a></span> | <span class="t">education ahead of your own financial future. You can borrow for college, often at reasonable rates,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=1657" target="_blank">00:27:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">but you can't easily borrow for your own retirement. So that's why I put education investing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=1662" target="_blank">00:27:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">after your own investing in a taxable brokerage account. Now, 529s do offer tax-free growth for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=1669" target="_blank">00:27:49.520</a></span> | <span class="t">qualified education expenses, and they can be a really great tool if you know you are going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=1674" target="_blank">00:27:54.200</a></span> | <span class="t">save to pay for college. However, I like to think about those as secondary to saving for myself, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=1679" target="_blank">00:27:59.880</a></span> | <span class="t">there are a few exceptions. If you are in a high-income household and you're already on track to fund your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=1684" target="_blank">00:28:04.680</a></span> | <span class="t">future and you know you're going to get there, you could absolutely make the case to move some of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=1689" target="_blank">00:28:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">your 529 contributions up earlier in this framework. Or if you live in a state that offers really generous</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=1695" target="_blank">00:28:15.080</a></span> | <span class="t">state income tax deductions or credits for 529s, which California sadly doesn't, then it could make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=1700" target="_blank">00:28:20.500</a></span> | <span class="t">sense to prioritize this a little earlier as well. Finally, we come to our last step, number 10, which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=1705" target="_blank">00:28:25.080</a></span> | <span class="t">is to look at your optional debt. These are things that are below 6%.

I remember a handful of years ago when your savings</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2092" target="_blank">00:34:52.500</a></span> | <span class="t">account was earning one percent or less, it felt really painful for me to keep money in cash knowing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2098" target="_blank">00:34:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">it was earning so little. Also knowing that because interest rates were little, borrowing money was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2104" target="_blank">00:35:04.260</a></span> | <span class="t">actually a lot more accessible in terms of the interest rate you would pay to do it. So here are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2108" target="_blank">00:35:08.580</a></span> | <span class="t">a few strategies to potentially pair with keeping less cash for your safety net or your short-term goals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2115" target="_blank">00:35:15.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So one is zero percent APR credit cards. Some credit cards offer 12 to 18 months of no interest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2121" target="_blank">00:35:21.660</a></span> | <span class="t">on purchases, sometimes on balance transfers. Usually you're going to make a minimum payment,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2125" target="_blank">00:35:25.900</a></span> | <span class="t">but you're not going to have to make the full payment. And so this could be a great backup</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2129" target="_blank">00:35:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">emergency buffer for circumstances where you all of a sudden need some cash and you don't want to have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2136" target="_blank">00:35:36.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to sell your investment accounts. You could take advantage of zero percent APR credit cards. Now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2141" target="_blank">00:35:41.380</a></span> | <span class="t">there's no guarantee that they will be around when you need them. There's no guarantee you will get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2145" target="_blank">00:35:45.420</a></span> | <span class="t">approved for them. And so obviously these strategies are advanced because they come with some risk,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2150" target="_blank">00:35:50.020</a></span> | <span class="t">but it is something that I know people have been able to take advantage of in those circumstances</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2154" target="_blank">00:35:54.360</a></span> | <span class="t">where they wanted to avoid selling from their taxable brokerage account. The next one could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2158" target="_blank">00:35:58.720</a></span> | <span class="t">be a home equity line of credit or a HELOC. And so for homeowners, if you have equity in your home</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2163" target="_blank">00:36:03.540</a></span> | <span class="t">beyond your down payment amount, usually, you can access that equity by borrowing against your home</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2169" target="_blank">00:36:09.220</a></span> | <span class="t">with a HELOC. Now, typically the rates here are lower than a lot of personal loans or credit cards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2175" target="_blank">00:36:15.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So that can make it advantageous. Also in a low interest rate environment, the HELOC rates are also low.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2180" target="_blank">00:36:20.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you have home equity and you need access to funds, you can effectively borrow from the bank</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2186" target="_blank">00:36:26.300</a></span> | <span class="t">with your home as collateral. And that allows you to have access to low cost borrowing that in certain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2192" target="_blank">00:36:32.860</a></span> | <span class="t">interest rate environments might be really compelling as an alternative to keeping money in cash.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2197" target="_blank">00:36:37.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So you could take that money that you would have kept in cash and put it in the stock market.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2201" target="_blank">00:36:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Similarly, you could do what's called a PLOC, which is a portfolio line of credit, or I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2207" target="_blank">00:36:47.100</a></span> | <span class="t">there's some other version of it that's a security line of credit or a security backed loan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2211" target="_blank">00:36:51.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And that lets you borrow against your taxable investments without having to sell them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2215" target="_blank">00:36:55.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So obviously the pros here are, you can access your taxable investments without triggering capital gains.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2221" target="_blank">00:37:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Depending on the platform, you can get them in as little as a day, maybe even same day sometimes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2226" target="_blank">00:37:06.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And they're pretty flexible on how long you need to repay them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2230" target="_blank">00:37:10.260</a></span> | <span class="t">But they do come with some risks and cons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2232" target="_blank">00:37:12.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So one, the rates on those loans are typically variable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2236" target="_blank">00:37:16.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And so in a low interest rate environment, they can be really compelling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2238" target="_blank">00:37:18.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So much so that you might think, well, this makes a lot more sense than keeping money in cash,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2243" target="_blank">00:37:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">earning nothing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2244" target="_blank">00:37:24.340</a></span> | <span class="t">But the biggest challenge here is that if your portfolio drops in value,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2248" target="_blank">00:37:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">you may face what's called a margin call.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2250" target="_blank">00:37:30.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I'm not going to do a deep dive here on the nuance of how this would happen and what happens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2255" target="_blank">00:37:35.940</a></span> | <span class="t">But the high level here is your brokerage firm is going to be able to loan you money</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2258" target="_blank">00:37:38.980</a></span> | <span class="t">as a percentage of your balance of the eligible securities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2262" target="_blank">00:37:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's say you had $100,000, they might be willing to loan you half of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2267" target="_blank">00:37:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So $50,000.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2268" target="_blank">00:37:48.120</a></span> | <span class="t">But if your portfolio drops from $100,000 because the market crashes to $80,000,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2273" target="_blank">00:37:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">they might only be willing to loan you $40,000.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2276" target="_blank">00:37:56.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And you might need to make a margin call or a deposit to close that gap.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2280" target="_blank">00:38:00.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is not for people who are really risk averse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2285" target="_blank">00:38:05.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Unless you do what I've done in the past, which is just keep that amount small.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2290" target="_blank">00:38:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So the amount that might trigger a margin call might be 60% or 70% of the loan to the portfolio value.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2298" target="_blank">00:38:18.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you were to borrow only 10% of your portfolio,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2302" target="_blank">00:38:22.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the risk that your portfolio drops so much that 10% you borrowed now becomes 70%</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2308" target="_blank">00:38:28.780</a></span> | <span class="t">is really a catastrophic situation

<span class="t">we did this where you couldn't borrow more than 30% of your portfolio.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2320" target="_blank">00:38:40.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And the primary reason is that we really didn't want to let people get into a situation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2324" target="_blank">00:38:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">where they were having to make these margin calls.</span></div><div class="c"><span

of your portfolio</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2331" target="_blank">00:38:51.480</a></span> | <span class="t">such that even a 50%

going to be 10% of your portfolio.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2365" target="_blank">00:39:25.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So I feel like that is a very low risk circumstance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2369" target="_blank">00:39:29.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Whereas if you only had $100,000 in your taxable brokerage account and you needed to borrow $80,000 or $100,000 for a safety net,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2376" target="_blank">00:39:36.520</a></span> | <span class="t">it would not be a scenario I'd want to rely on.</span></div><div class="c"><span

rates.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2381" target="_blank">00:39:41.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Right now with high interest rates, both to borrow and to earn on cash,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2385" target="_blank">00:39:45.080</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:39:48.440</a></span> | <span class="t">But if things change, it might make sense to invest that money and rely on being able to borrow from your portfolio.</span></div><div

the markets, but give you access to liquidity when you need it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2400" target="_blank">00:40:00.240</a></span> | <span class="t">But obviously it comes with some risks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2402" target="_blank">00:40:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So please go do some research before you take advantage of it.</span></div><div

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2470" target="_blank">00:41:10.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So you said you've got about a $10,000 emergency fund right now.</span></div><div

a bit more of a safety net.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2479" target="_blank">00:41:19.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't

target="_blank">00:41:26.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So that would be the first place I prioritize with the money from selling your house.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2490" target="_blank">00:41:30.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Obviously, before that, I would prioritize setting aside any money you're going to owe for taxes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2494" target="_blank">00:41:34.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But assuming that you

you're going to owe taxes on that windfall, you set that aside first.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2514" target="_blank">00:41:54.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Next, I'd go through that debt review process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2518" target="_blank">00:41:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">You mentioned you have $50,000 of student loans.</span></div><div class="c"><span

owed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2524" target="_blank">00:42:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I don't know the percent

target="_blank">00:42:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">The car loan at 5.24%, that's pretty close to the break-even point, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1ukq_v3V2c&t=2539" target="_blank">00:42:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It's going to probably not be as much as you earn on cash.</span></div><div
