They want transparency in that. If I told your listeners today that the greatest need at Charity Water was a new expensive copy machine because we needed to print a bunch of paper copies and it was gonna be $3,000 or something, people would donate for a copy machine to meet a need, to meet a specific need if they knew how that would move the mission forward.</p><p>It's the not knowing where the money goes. It's the fine print during many of the disasters where you find out actually $100 million that was given went into an endowment, which won't see the light of day because in that fine print, the organizations say, well, if we over-raise what we can spend, we can do anything with this money.</p></div></div></body></html>
