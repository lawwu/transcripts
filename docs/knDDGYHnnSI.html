Until a few months ago. A few</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.580</a></span> | <span class="t">months ago, at Google I/O, they took the next step, ushered in by the AI engineers conference a year ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, not quite, but of course, the entire craze around Gen AI. And this is one of the examples that they did,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.860</a></span> | <span class="t">the classic travel itinerary.

This is ushering in the next era of web search, the GraphRag era. What I'm going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.100</a></span> | <span class="t">talk to you about today is how can you use, well, first of all, should you, and if so, how can you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.020</a></span> | <span class="t">use GraphRag for your own RAG-based applications? So what is GraphRag, right? It is very, very simple.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.980</a></span> | <span class="t">GraphRag is RAG where on the retrieval path you use a knowledge graph. Very, very simple. It doesn't say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.620</a></span> | <span class="t">you only use a knowledge graph, but you use a knowledge graph. Maybe in combination with other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.020</a></span> | <span class="t">technologies like vector search. So let's take the classic example of a customer service bot,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=329" target="_blank">00:05:29.020</a></span> | <span class="t">right? And let's say that you are working at a company that is building Wi-Fi routers, for example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.460</a></span> | <span class="t">right? And you have a bunch of support articles, right? And they've been stored in text files, right? And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.340</a></span> | <span class="t">you are tasked with building a bot that either gives direct end users access to it or your own</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.100</a></span> | <span class="t">customer service agents, employees, like access to this information. And you know how to do this because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=355" target="_blank">00:05:55.340</a></span> | <span class="t">you live in the LLM world, in the Gen.AI world, so you're going to use RAG for this, right? And so you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.900</a></span> | <span class="t">have that data. It's text documents. You've added that text onto the properties of particular nodes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=367" target="_blank">00:06:07.500</a></span> | <span class="t">right? So you have a node per article. But then you've also said that, you know what,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=371" target="_blank">00:06:11.660</a></span> | <span class="t">this article is about this particular Wi-Fi product, right? So you have a relation to that Wi-Fi product.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=377" target="_blank">00:06:17.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And that Wi-Fi product sits in a hierarchy of other Wi-Fi products. And it's written by this particular</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=383" target="_blank">00:06:23.500</a></span> | <span class="t">customer service engineer, you know, that kind of stuff. And then the end user has a question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Hey, my Wi-Fi lights are flashing yellow and my connection drops. Like, what should I do? Something like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=395" target="_blank">00:06:35.340</a></span> | <span class="t">I think we all know how we do this. We vectorize the search, right? We get some kind of vector embedding back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.340</a></span> | <span class="t">We use vector search to get the core documents. But here's where the graph RAG part kicks in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.780</a></span> | <span class="t">You get those core articles back, which are linked to the nodes. Actually, the text is on the nodes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=412" target="_blank">00:06:52.140</a></span> | <span class="t">But then you use the graph to traverse from there and retrieve more context around it. Maybe it's not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=418" target="_blank">00:06:58.380</a></span> | <span class="t">just that particular article for that particular Wi-Fi, but something else in that family. Maybe you use the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=425" target="_blank">00:07:05.180</a></span> | <span class="t">fact that this particular engineer has very highly ranked content. And then you rank that higher,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=430" target="_blank">00:07:10.620</a></span> | <span class="t">right? You retrieve more context than what you get out of the ANN-based search from your vector store.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=437" target="_blank">00:07:17.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And you pass that on to the LLM. Along with the question, you get an answer back, and you hand it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=442" target="_blank">00:07:22.620</a></span> | <span class="t">to the user. So the core pattern is actually really, really simple, but really, really powerful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=450" target="_blank">00:07:30.060</a></span> | <span class="t">All right? You start with doing a vector search. I think of this almost as a primary key. It's,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=456" target="_blank">00:07:36.220</a></span> | <span class="t">of course, not a primary key, but almost like a primary key lookup into the graph. You use that vector</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=460" target="_blank">00:07:40.940</a></span> | <span class="t">search. You get an initial set of nodes. Then you walk the graph, and you expand that and find relevant</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=468" target="_blank">00:07:48.780</a></span> | <span class="t">content based on the structure of the graph. Then you take that and you return it to the LLM. Or optionally,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=475" target="_blank">00:07:55.100</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe that gives you 1,000 or 10,000 nodes back. And then you do what Google did. You rank that. You get the top</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=482" target="_blank">00:08:02.460</a></span> | <span class="t">K based on the structure of the graph. Maybe you even use page rank, right? You get that. You pass it on to the LLM.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=488" target="_blank">00:08:08.700</a></span> | <span class="t">It's really, really simple, but really, really powerful. And then there's a number more advanced</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=494" target="_blank">00:08:14.380</a></span> | <span class="t">patterns, but that's kind of the next talk I'll do in a year. It's more sophisticated graph retrieval</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=500" target="_blank">00:08:20.780</a></span> | <span class="t">patterns, right? But the core one, very, very simple. Okay. So if that's what GraphRag is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.420</a></span> | <span class="t">what are the benefits of GraphRag? When should you use it? When should you not use it? The first and most</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=515" target="_blank">00:08:35.340</a></span> | <span class="t">stark benefit is accuracy. It's directly correlated to the quality of the answer. There's been a ton</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=522" target="_blank">00:08:42.300</a></span> | <span class="t">of research articles about this in the last six months, something like that. I believe the first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=527" target="_blank">00:08:47.900</a></span> | <span class="t">one was this one by data.world. I just picked out three at random here that I like. This is the first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=534" target="_blank">00:08:54.460</a></span> | <span class="t">one that I know of by data.world, which is a data cataloging company based on a knowledge graph. And they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=540" target="_blank">00:09:00.300</a></span> | <span class="t">proved out across, I think, 43 different questions that on average, the response quality, the accuracy,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=548" target="_blank">00:09:08.060</a></span> | <span class="t">was three times higher if they use a knowledge graph in combination with vector search.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=554" target="_blank">00:09:14.780</a></span> | <span class="t">I love this paper by LinkedIn. It shows a very similar type. I think it's like 75% or 77%</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=562" target="_blank">00:09:22.540</a></span> | <span class="t">increase in accuracy. But it also has a great architecture view. So you can take the QR code</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=568" target="_blank">00:09:28.940</a></span> | <span class="t">right there and look at that paper, which combines various components and also the flow through that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=574" target="_blank">00:09:34.620</a></span> | <span class="t">that I thought was just really pedagogical. But by and large, it's showing the same thing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=580" target="_blank">00:09:40.220</a></span> | <span class="t">a little bit of different numbers, but significantly higher accuracy when it used graph in combination</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=585" target="_blank">00:09:45.900</a></span> | <span class="t">with vector search. And then Microsoft had a fantastic blog post and subsequently, I think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=591" target="_blank">00:09:51.900</a></span> | <span class="t">two academic papers. The blog post was in February of this year, where they also talk about the increased</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=598" target="_blank">00:09:58.300</a></span> | <span class="t">quality of response. But also beyond that, hey, you know what? GraphRag enables us to answer another</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=605" target="_blank">00:10:05.900</a></span> | <span class="t">important class of questions that we couldn't even do with vector search alone or baseline</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=611" target="_blank">00:10:11.260</a></span> | <span class="t">vector search or baseline RAG alone. So first benefit, higher quality response back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=617" target="_blank">00:10:17.740</a></span> | <span class="t">The second one is easier development. And this one is a little bit interesting because there's an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=624" target="_blank">00:10:24.540</a></span> | <span class="t">asterisk in there. Because what we hear very clearly from our users is that it's easier to build RAG</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=630" target="_blank">00:10:30.220</a></span> | <span class="t">applications with graph RAG compared to baseline RAG. But we also hear it's like, it's actually hard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=636" target="_blank">00:10:36.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And what's the nuance there? Well, the nuance is if you already have a knowledge graph up and running.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=642" target="_blank">00:10:42.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's a learning curve where people need to learn, how do I create the knowledge graph in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=646" target="_blank">00:10:46.300</a></span> | <span class="t">first place? Once you have that, it's a lot easier. But how do you create that knowledge graph,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=652" target="_blank">00:10:52.380</a></span> | <span class="t">right? So let's put a little pin in that. If I rush through the next few slides quickly enough,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=657" target="_blank">00:10:57.580</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to show you hopefully a demo on that. But let's put a little pin in that. So this is an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=662" target="_blank">00:11:02.860</a></span> | <span class="t">example. This is from a very high growth stage fintech company that is very cutting edge in AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=672" target="_blank">00:11:12.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And they started playing around with graph RAG a few, about six months ago. And they took an existing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=677" target="_blank">00:11:17.500</a></span> | <span class="t">application and they said, you know what? We are going to port this from a vector database to Neo4j,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=683" target="_blank">00:11:23.500</a></span> | <span class="t">and most of the operations yield a better result. They can calculate the embeddings on a database</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=688" target="_blank">00:11:28.460</a></span> | <span class="t">level. Getting related actions is as simple as following the relationships between nodes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=693" target="_blank">00:11:33.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And this one I love. The cache, and the cache here is their application, they call it the cache,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=699" target="_blank">00:11:39.100</a></span> | <span class="t">can be visualized. This is an extremely valuable debugging tool. And in the parenthesis, I actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=705" target="_blank">00:11:45.420</a></span> | <span class="t">said that you've already fixed a couple of bugs just thanks to this. Right? Amazing. Like once you've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=711" target="_blank">00:11:51.180</a></span> | <span class="t">been able to create that graph, it's a lot easier to build your RAG application.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=715" target="_blank">00:11:55.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And why is that? Right? So let's talk a little bit about representation. Let's say we have the phrase</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=723" target="_blank">00:12:03.980</a></span> | <span class="t">in there, apples and oranges are both fruit. And we want to represent that in vector space and in graph</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=730" target="_blank">00:12:10.060</a></span> | <span class="t">space. In graph space, we already talked about this. Apple is a fruit. Orange is a fruit. Pretty easy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=736" target="_blank">00:12:16.700</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the representation in graph space. In vector space, it looks like this. Maybe. Or maybe this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=744" target="_blank">00:12:24.780</a></span> | <span class="t">something else like we actually don't know. Two different ways of representing that phrase.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=749" target="_blank">00:12:29.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we can run similarity calculations in different ways using these both representations that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=756" target="_blank">00:12:36.540</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not going to go through right now. We can search in different ways. These are not competing ways of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=762" target="_blank">00:12:42.940</a></span> | <span class="t">doing it. They're complementary ways of doing it. Right? One is not better than the other. Except I will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=767" target="_blank">00:12:47.980</a></span> | <span class="t">make one statement. Which is, when you sit down and you write your application, when you build your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=774" target="_blank">00:12:54.860</a></span> | <span class="t">application, I'm actually going to make the statement that one of them is superior. This vector space</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=780" target="_blank">00:13:00.540</a></span> | <span class="t">representation is completely opaque to a human being. But the graph representation is very, very clear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=788" target="_blank">00:13:08.220</a></span> | <span class="t">It is explicit. It's deterministic. It's visual. You can see it. You can touch it as you build your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=794" target="_blank">00:13:14.620</a></span> | <span class="t">applications. This is the, I already fixed a couple of bugs thanks to this. Just by porting it from a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=800" target="_blank">00:13:20.460</a></span> | <span class="t">vector-only store to graph rag, they were able to see and work with the data. And that is really freaking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=807" target="_blank">00:13:27.100</a></span> | <span class="t">powerful. That shows up in development time as you're building your applications. It's also showing up for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=814" target="_blank">00:13:34.540</a></span> | <span class="t">our friends in IT who worry about things maybe that is not directly related to building the application,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=821" target="_blank">00:13:41.580</a></span> | <span class="t">which is explainability, which is auditability, which is governance. That explicit data structure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=830" target="_blank">00:13:50.060</a></span> | <span class="t">has knock-on effects over there that are really, really powerful. Once you're up and running in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=835" target="_blank">00:13:55.740</a></span> | <span class="t">production, you need to be able to explain why something happened.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=839" target="_blank">00:13:59.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So, higher accuracy, better answers, easier to build once you're through the hump of creating the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=848" target="_blank">00:14:08.140</a></span> | <span class="t">knowledge graph, and then increased explainability and governance for IT and the business, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=853" target="_blank">00:14:13.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Those are the three things. So, how do you get started with graph rag? Well, I've talked a lot about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=860" target="_blank">00:14:20.940</a></span> | <span class="t">this already. Like, how do you create the knowledge graph in the first place? So, a little bit of nuance here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=866" target="_blank">00:14:26.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So, basically, there are three types of data out in the world that I care about when I think about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=871" target="_blank">00:14:31.260</a></span> | <span class="t">knowledge graph creation. The first one is structured data. So, this is your data in your snowflake or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=876" target="_blank">00:14:36.780</a></span> | <span class="t">something like that or Postgres, right? The other one is unstructured data, PDF files, raw text from a web</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=883" target="_blank">00:14:43.500</a></span> | <span class="t">page. And the other one, the third one is mixed. People tend to call this semi-structured, but it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=889" target="_blank">00:14:49.180</a></span> | <span class="t">not. Hit me up afterwards and I'll tell you why it's not. But basically, what this one is is structured data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=894" target="_blank">00:14:54.060</a></span> | <span class="t">where some of the fields are long form text, right? Basically, we're great in the first bucket in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=901" target="_blank">00:15:01.980</a></span> | <span class="t">graph world. It's very easy to go from Snowflake or Postgres or MySQL or Oracle into a property graph</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=908" target="_blank">00:15:08.540</a></span> | <span class="t">model. The unstructured one is really freaking hard, right? It's hard to do in theory. It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=916" target="_blank">00:15:16.700</a></span> | <span class="t">also had immature tooling for a long run. The middle one is actually where the majority of at least</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=924" target="_blank">00:15:24.300</a></span> | <span class="t">enterprise production use cases are in the real world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=929" target="_blank">00:15:29.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So, man, two and a half minutes. This is rough. There are two types of graphs and I'm not going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=935" target="_blank">00:15:35.180</a></span> | <span class="t">to talk about them. I want to talk about them. Lexical graphs and domain graphs is actually really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=939" target="_blank">00:15:39.260</a></span> | <span class="t">relevant, but I really want to get to this demo. So, I've talked about creating graphs with unstructured</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=946" target="_blank">00:15:46.060</a></span> | <span class="t">information. So, we just built this new tool that we launched just a few weeks ago called the Knowledge</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=951" target="_blank">00:15:51.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Graph Builder. And you see it here. Can you see the screen? Okay. So, basically, here you can drag</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=958" target="_blank">00:15:58.380</a></span> | <span class="t">and drop your PDF files. You can put in YouTube links, Wikipedia links. You can point it to your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=964" target="_blank">00:16:04.220</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of cloud service buckets, right? And it's going to extract the data from there and create the graph.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=969" target="_blank">00:16:09.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So, here I added a few things. I added a PDF of Andrew Ning's newsletter, The Batch. I added the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=977" target="_blank">00:16:17.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Wikipedia page for OpenAI. And I added the YouTube from Swix and Alessio's, you know, the Four Wars Latent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=984" target="_blank">00:16:24.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Space Podcast. So, I added all that and I uploaded it into this Knowledge Graph Builder. And when I do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=993" target="_blank">00:16:33.100</a></span> | <span class="t">that, it creates if -- let's see here. I knew the Ethernet connection was going to do it. It automagically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=1002" target="_blank">00:16:42.380</a></span> | <span class="t">I created a little Knowledge Graph. If it renders -- wait for it.
