I'm currently Chief Architect at All Hands AI, makers of the leading open source coding agent called Open Hands.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=8" target="_blank">00:00:08.280</a></span> | <span class="t">But I'd like to talk about something different today.</span></div><div class="c"><span

actually snuck in the back door today because this is not an AI talk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=24" target="_blank">00:00:24.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Perhaps this is not even a programming talk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=29" target="_blank">00:00:29.340</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a talk about empathy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=31" target="_blank">00:00:31.560</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a talk about listening to each other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=35" target="_blank">00:00:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">But if those things are uncomfortable for you, don't worry, because we will have the pleasant, comforting backdrop of AI and programming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=43" target="_blank">00:00:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">For starters, let me take you through a day in the life of an AI skeptic, which is the role I so often find myself in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=52" target="_blank">00:00:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">What happens is someone will say something provocative in public, like you may have seen the CEO of Anthropic,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=58" target="_blank">00:00:58.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Dario Amadei say a few months ago at a Council on Foreign Relations interview.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=65" target="_blank">00:01:05.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Many interesting things in that interview, but a quote that we saw got shared around a lot was in 12 months, we may be in a world where AI is writing essentially all the code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=75" target="_blank">00:01:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Right now, speaking to a general audience, as software engineers, we hear a little bit different when you're saying the part about writing the code, because we understand that the job contains, you know, other factors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=89" target="_blank">00:01:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">But regardless, I posted a friendly challenge in response to that to do with, like, could you replace the software in one mainframe?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=100" target="_blank">00:01:40.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Can we kill one mainframe even, how difficult is that right now with these AI tools that are soon to supposedly write essentially all the code, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And the specifics of my challenge are not really that relevant right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So, just over the past two years, I have repeatedly said different forms of this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I have repeatedly said different forms of this LLMs, large language models, break old code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.340</a></span> | <span class="t">I say that a lot because I think it is ignored, simply the importance of maintaining old code and keeping it alive, that already is ignored and the extent to which these AI tools are performing much better on writing new code than in editing code that already exists, I feel like that's sort of doubly ignored as a result.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.340</a></span> | <span class="t">I feel like I raise pretty basic questions and point out pretty obvious limitations a lot of the time and get somewhat extreme reactions, honestly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.860</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I've been called a Luddite.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.540</a></span> | <span class="t">I've been told I have my head in the sand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.380</a></span> | <span class="t">I've been told I'm missing the big picture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.780</a></span> | <span class="t">In the case where I posted that challenge, actually, the full quote was, I was completely missing the big picture so much that it physically hurts to read my post.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, if my posts have hurt you, I'm sorry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Honestly, it doesn't feel good to be talked to in any of these ways, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So you may have had to feel that way at some point as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Or maybe you've been told this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You've been told that you'll be left behind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I struggle with this one, honestly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.060</a></span> | <span class="t">I feel that left behind is verbiage better suited for, you know, some post-apocalyptic religious prophecy in the form of a B-movie franchise starring Kirk Cameron than in some sort of nuanced technical discussion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I heard this one recently from someone who was saying it with a straight face and is someone whose work I respect, you know, goes back a long time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.060</a></span> | <span class="t">They said resistance is futile.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, I cannot comprehend what would make someone want to say things like this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.620</a></span> | <span class="t">For all the money in the bank, do you recall what that quote is from?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Was it from the hero of that story?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.700</a></span> | <span class="t">No.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.680</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a quote from the Borg, from Star Trek, one of the most notorious villains in the entire science fiction genre.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">If we find ourselves quoting the Borg in earnest, maybe we should reassess what side we're on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.480</a></span> | <span class="t">When Picard was captured and being mind-controlled by the AI, he said resistance is futile as Locutus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">But the real Picard would never say resistance is futile.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, Picard would say if you're on the side of truth, you should resist to the last breath.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.660</a></span> | <span class="t">He embodied that again and again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But we need to breathe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm responding to emotionally charged rhetoric and now I've started spewing out my own emotionally charged rhetoric in response.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=302" target="_blank">00:05:02.500</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=319" target="_blank">00:05:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I think we need to back up and decide what are we even talking about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.980</a></span> | <span class="t">It is something very important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.460</a></span> | <span class="t">It makes sense that a lot of us feel strongly about it, which then leads to us being in conflict with each other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=332"

this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.240</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think it is an important

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's get started.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">These are Extreme Completion, the Devocalypse, the Abstraction Leap, Uncharted Waters, the Review Economy, and the Infinite Pile of Garbage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.740</a></span> | <span class="t">We will discuss each of these briefly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=398" target="_blank">00:06:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, Extreme Completion is probably the most conservative of these views because it is already happening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">We can just see it happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=408" target="_blank">00:06:48.540</a></span> | <span class="t">There's no real doubt about whether this one will happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=411" target="_blank">00:06:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just a matter of, you know, how much with what impact.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=415" target="_blank">00:06:55.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And that is simply the autocomplete style editors like Cursor, like GitHub Copilot are just going to continue to help us type more of the typing and be a great convenience, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=433" target="_blank">00:07:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So in that scenario, in Extreme Completion, our job doesn't fundamentally change.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=439" target="_blank">00:07:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Even as they progress to these agents that can take a few more steps, you can still have, you know, fairly extreme completion with it still needing to be on an engineer's lease most of the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=451" target="_blank">00:07:31.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Such that you could argue our role is not changing like

is one of those ideas.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=682" target="_blank">00:11:22.500</a></span> | <span class="t">It has a few

if you're a believer in abstraction leap, you think that what we currently think of as code will no longer be the kind of level of abstraction, the substrate in which we do our main work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=700" target="_blank">00:11:40.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Doing something like Java code or

target="_blank">00:12:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So how does that happen?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=734"

are a domain-specific language for particular programming tasks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=900" target="_blank">00:15:00.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you also have ones that are made for particular business domains, even things like Excel, you know, arguably are a domain-specific language.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=910" target="_blank">00:15:10.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So, these are very prolific,

you do if you're operationalizing this, you know, in an enterprise scenario, is you ultimately are investing in creating a particular specialized programming environment that, you know, optimizes for the kinds of thoughts you usually need to express in your business domain, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s6Q-y42ZZA&t=933"
