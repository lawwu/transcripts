On the one hand, I take a lot of risk in equities over here, but then over here in my more liquid bucket is cash savings. And that's for any sort of rainy day fund or vacations or any other shorter intermediate term thing that we're planning for, I think cash can become a gateway drug to market timing.</p><p>You really have to make a definition in your, in your head of your portfolio of this cash is part of my overall asset allocation, or it's my emergency fund, or it's my intermediate term savings or whatever it is, if you don't have these, these things bucketed out, if you're just kind of going up about this without a plan and say, yeah, cash rates are high, I'm going to put all my money there and the stock market takes off, then what do you do?</p><p>You have to have a plan of attack with that, whether that's cash is ever going to be invested, or if it's not, I think you can't just get stuck in the middle where you're trying to guess when a good time to put it back in the market is.</p></div></div></body></html>
