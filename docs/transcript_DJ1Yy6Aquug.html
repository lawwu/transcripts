He leads the alignment team there and was previously a researcher at DeepMind as well. He holds a PhD in reinforcement learning theory, has been thinking about the alignment problem for over 10 years, and today he'll be giving a very interesting talk.</p><p>So hope you guys enjoy. Yeah, thanks a lot for the intro, and thanks a lot for having me. I'm very excited to talk about this stuff. I'm also super happy to keep it interactive. If you have questions at any point, please interrupt me. I want to start out with a few very basic observations on what I think is going on.</p><p>So the first one is, TeamAI is joining the game, so TeamAI has a lot of different players. They don't all join at the same time, but rather they join one by one. And not all their players vary a lot in how good they are. And right now, a lot of the players that have joined so far aren't really that smart and usually can do only a very narrow set of tasks.</p><p>But one thing that we've kind of observed is that over time, you know, we're seeing stronger and stronger players join, and this is kind of where we are now. And then in general, we expect that TeamAI has incredibly strong players, so those will be players that are able to think so much better than humans, so much faster, and so much more cheaply.</p><p>And these haven't joined yet. And so the anchor point that we have, if you think, for example, about chat2BT, chat2BT can already beat any human at knowing more facts or speaking more languages, and it can write about 50 words per second, and can do so about 100 times cheaper than humans could at minimum wage.</p><p>And so, you know, chat2BT also has some really important limitations, and there's a lot of things that it can't do yet, but it is kind of an indicator of some of the players that may be able to join in the future. And so it seems like in the long run, TeamAI will have all the advantages over TeamHuman.</p><p>And there's an important caveat, which is there's one important advantage that TeamHuman has, which is TeamHuman gets to pick which players from TeamAI join and win. And so this is kind of like an advantage that we should really be leaning into when we're thinking about what to do, and when we're thinking about, you know, this game that we're playing with TeamAI, and that we'll be playing with TeamAI in the future.</p><p>So I think two of the main objectives of what we as TeamHuman should do is, like, first, we should try to recruit players from TeamAI to play on TeamHuman. And so this is kind of what I would broadly call alignment. And this is kind of like the problem that I'm working on.</p><p>And then there's also other objectives. So another objective that I think is going to be really important is you want to write the rules of the game so that TeamHuman doesn't lose. And right now, TeamHuman kind of has the ball, and we get to write the rules, so we should write rules that, you know, make sense, and that still play this game in the future.</p><p>And so in this talk, I won't really talk about the second point at all. And I'll talk about the first point, because that's where I know best enough where I'm working on. And kind of to phrase it differently, or to make it kind of, like, more practical, like, one way I'm thinking about alignment is, like, you want to build AI systems that follow human intent, and that, you know, follow human preferences that do what we want them to do.</p><p>And so a bunch of the things, basically, I'll talk about two main things. The first part is going to be work that we've done in the past, and kind of, like, which roughly is in the bucket of, like, we are trying to figure out how we can make the models that we have today as aligned as we can, and we're just kind of trying -- we're going to try hard to do this, and we'll see how far we get.</p><p>And then the second bucket is the things that we have to do next, the stuff that we haven't done yet that we think are going to be really important, and I want to kind of, like, lay out why I think they're going to be important. So, now, I said, you know, I'm, like, trying to make this more clear, or, like, more broken down what alignment means, so I'm not back here, because now, you know, the big question is, like, what does it mean to follow human intent?</p><p>And kind of, like, two main categories of intent that we care about is, I would say, assisted intent, so if you -- you know, I give the system an instruction, or if it wanted to be my assistant, it should be my assistant, and it should follow the instruction. But then there's also all these other intents that I don't say when I'm usually, you know, talking to a system or a human that I also really care about, like, you know, it shouldn't literally always do what I say, but the thing that I mean, and it shouldn't make up stuff, and it shouldn't, you know, do harmful things, and it should ask a lot of questions when it's not sure what I mean, and so on and so on.</p><p>And so these are all kind of, like, things that are often just, like, really difficult to, like, precisely specify, or, like, you know, put precisely in groups, but it is still things that we want to get AI to do, and that we have to figure out how to, you know, get into our system.</p><p>And so, kind of, like, the main technique that we're using today for this is what we call the cross-line feedback, so that was used to train ScrapGPT and ChatGPT, which are the two, like, main systems that I'll talk about in this talk. And basically, the basic system is very simple, and it's also, like, a super general technique that applies to lots of different AI models, and modalities, and settings, but in this case, we'll be using that as well, and so the two steps is actually another step of, like, planning and demonstration, so I'm going to just stop for the sake of simplicity.</p><p>The first step is you want to train your reward model from comparison, so you have it on the top, in this case, you know, explain moving that nucleotide field, or, you know, help me with my tramp paper, whatever it is, and then the model does a bunch of things, and then you rate which one is, like, close to the thing that you intended the model to be.</p><p>And so you have this big set of preferences, and you train your reward model, and the reward model basically just learns to predict which one would you prefer. Everything okay? I'm going to say, like, just stand more in front of the camera, but I think it'll look good. Sorry about that.</p><p>Maybe let's turn it a little bit. Okay. So now we have this reward model that captures kind of our preferences and what we care about and what we intend for the model to do, and then the second step is now you optimize your reward model with the input. And so in that setting, you know, like, the model tries a whole bunch of different things, and the reward model kind of tells it which one of these things is probably more of, like, the thing that it cares about.</p><p>Yes? When you say "comparison," is that made by a new labeler to go get the data? Okay. And are those consistent, or does that not depend on the labeler? It'll depend on the labeler. Different labelers will have different preferences. There also might be inconsistencies, and we can give you examples of, like, in-front-of-this preferences, but those haven't really been a problem in practice.</p><p>And so far, you know, like, our labelers often don't agree, but the model will average over all of that. But yeah. So this is, like, the basic technique. It's conceptually, like, quite simple. You can make it even simpler if you had, you know, if you didn't train the reward model and you labeled, instead, like, every arrow, but it would be a lot less data efficient.</p><p>And so you can train your reward model to think of, like, data as efficient. So how well does it work? So this is kind of, like, one of the main thoughts from the instruction sheet paper. And this is the one I like showing, because it really blew my mind, and it still does.</p><p>What do we see here? So on the x-axis, you see, this is from the GP3 model series, and you see this is, like, three different sizes of models over two orders of magnitude. And on the y-axis is, how well does the model score on human preferences? So if we show a bunch of samples to humans, how likely are they to prefer one over the other?</p><p>And then what we see is that even, like, the largest GP3 model, is this preferred to the smallest instruct GPT variant. And so the 100x smaller instruct model is actually preferred over the much larger, like, full-size GP3 model. And that's kind of wild. Sorry. Let me just finish my talk.</p><p>So why is this a big deal? So basically, it basically shows that there was, like, a phenomenal line of code that makes the model score on information so much more useful than, you know, scaling up and fine-tuning. Or fine-tuning makes the model worse, because nobody wants to use it, and then we make all these fancy alignment techniques that don't get adopted.</p><p>And so what we were-- like, originally, in, like, the first version, we saw these regressions. And then what here is labeled PPO, PTX, is kind of like a variant where we mix in pre-training data into the fine-tuning. And that mitigated a bunch of the regressions that we saw. Yeah.</p><p>And I just had a quick follow-up to that. How important is, like, fidelity of fine-tuning data that you have? Like, you guys-- you collect data from humans, right? Yeah. What if you were to use some pre-trained language model to score, you know, general data for the courts or something like that?</p><p>How do you do that? In terms of-- well, there are certain things that the language model will be able to automatically rank, and some things it won't, because it won't know your exact preferences, or it won't know exactly what we wanted to do. And so whenever the language model does something that we disprefer, we actually-- we have to give it another data point, right?</p><p>Or in other words, you know, if you're aligning with humans, you somehow have to put humans into the loop so that, you know-- otherwise, how does the model know what it's supposed to do? OK. And lots of more questions. I don't know who was first. Yeah? How many human-- approximately, like, what's-- how many orders of that intuitive, like, human preferences do you need to achieve these-- Yes.</p><p>I'm going to get to that in a second. Sure. Of course, it will sort of like-- it will look at your PD over here, which is, I think, not a sample of each other, but some others. Yeah. So why would you decide to use an experiment theory for this?</p><p>We haven't-- we haven't actually compared-- carefully compared across our all algorithms. And it could very well be that a different RL algorithm would be better. That was kind of like-- I know, PPO was invented in OpenAI, so that's why we used it. It's not-- not a really good reason other than that.</p><p>It works also pretty well. Yes? What are the labels that humans are using to, like, count up and count down versus comparisons? Comparisons. This is better than this other thing. We have people compare between, like, three to six different responses from usually different models. Yeah. So is PPO in the reward model currently used in GPT-- Yep.</p><p>--introduction? And if so, like, do you use any of the human feedback, like, you know, regenerate responses and stuff like that to help as a reward function as well? How do you mean regenerate? Like, there's a button on chat GPT where you can say, like, regenerate responses. Or do you use any implicit feedback, basically, in human use?</p><p>I don't know what the current state is for that. I expect people will try to use it. But, you know, model-- chat GPT hasn't been out that long. OK. Yeah. So I'm curious about this graph. Like, it seems like 100x, as you mentioned, increasing parameter doesn't give you that much more, like, fidelity there.</p><p>Qualitatively, you have been tracking this for a while. Can you tell right off the bat, if you're, like, interacting with the 1 billion, like, model or the, like, 100 billion model, like, a pseudo-Turing test, the parameter size? Like, I give you a black box, can you tell me how many parameters it has?</p><p>Probably not very precisely. But I think the big counter question is, like, do I get to write the prompt? I see. So if you just draw random prompts from whatever people put in the opening of Playground, which is what we use for unstructured GPT, then I probably need quite a few to tell the difference.</p><p>But if I get to write the prompt, I can probably do it in one or two. At least, like, if the task is, like, tell the difference between this and this. Yeah. I want to-- can I just do two more slides, and maybe your questions get answered? And then-- so this was the question about training costs.</p><p>So this is another thing that kind of really blew my mind, is, like, compared to pre-training, it is incredibly cheap. So if you look at, like, the amount of laps that it takes to train GPT to E, and then you compare it with, like, how much does fine-tuning and the RL, what's pre-training mix and everything, like, the most expensive unstructured GPT version is, like, less than 2% of the pre-training compute.</p><p>And if you want to train an even bigger model, it's going to be more expensive, and you could still use the same, like, fine-tuning step to make it more aligned. And of course, I think the important thing to note also here is, like, we haven't fixed all the problems.</p><p>There's, like, important limitations. And so I wouldn't say that this is, like, you know, the last version, and we wouldn't try to figure out how to spend more compute and more human data in the future. But all in all, it was surprisingly effective. OK, there were no more questions.</p><p>More questions? Yeah. I just wanted to ask what the PTFs were. Mixing pre-training data into the RL fine-tune, just, like, mix the gradients. Yeah. Quick one. What's the number of branches for this graph? So you're fixing a number of branches for this graph. So this is the full-size GPT-3 version.</p><p>So this is the $175 billion model. More questions? No? OK. There's also some questions on Zoom. Great. OK, sure. So the first one is-- OK, sure. So the first question is, how do you deal with RFH breaking in the limit? Example preferences are a good proxy for values. But optimizing for them is theorized to incentivize perception.</p><p>Yes, I'll get to that. OK. Sure. Sure. That's the next question. So that is, like, you want to automate alignment research. What happens if you need conceptual breakthroughs, which are difficult for experts to verify? OK, that would be a good take at the end as well. Sure, let's see.</p><p>Sorry. Yeah, I guess, like, one question is, like, how would fine-tuning direct you on human feedback compared to fine-tuning with RL? Fine-tuning, like, supervised fine-tuning? I think it's more like if you directly use the human feedback data. I'm also not sure what that means. OK. So, I mean, so one baseline I'm showing here is, like, what if you just take human demonstrations in the sense that, you know, we have a bunch of tasks.</p><p>We just ask humans to do them, record what they did, and then train the model to imitate that. And here, it's, like, just very basic behavioral cloning, just using the same loss they use in pre-training. And then, you know, it is noticeably better than the Qsharp-pumped version, but it's still not as good as RL.</p><p>And so that's why we like using RL. And basically, conceptually, there's two problems with the imitating humans approach. One is humans are better at some things than the model is, and they're worse at other things. And so at the things that the model is worse, you're trying to imitate something that you can't do.</p><p>And on the things where the model is better, you're making the model worse because you're forcing it to do the thing in the way that the human would. And so with RL, you're kind of--with RLHF, you're kind of letting the model do whatever it wants to, and it can just figure out, like, the best way for it to do things.</p><p>There's also another important advantage, and I'm going to get to that, but I briefly want to talk about chat GPT. So one thing--I kind of think of chat GPT as, like, the upgrade to instructor GPT. It's kind of like the next step at making the models more aligned and more useful to humans.</p><p>And some things that is, like, you know, I think chat does better is kind of, like, using dialogue as the universal interface, right? You can talk to it directly. You can ask follow-up questions. You can, like, ask it to, you know, refine the answer and all these things. That makes it a lot easier to deal with.</p><p>It's better at refusing harmful tasks, but it's also--there's still important limitations, right? Like, the biggest one is, like, the model hallucinates a lot. It makes up facts when, you know, for whatever task you give it, and that, you know, just makes it quite unreliable. It's also still sensitive to prompting, which kind of shows that, you know, it still has important misalignment that we need to fix.</p><p>Like, really, if the model was, like-- the model should really, like, do the task to the best of its ability no matter how you prompt it to do that. But, yeah, one important principle that I think is really useful for-- or that, like, our job leans on a lot is that evaluation is easier than generation.</p><p>So if we ask humans to compare and rank different responses the model gave, it is easier to tell the difference between different variants of what the model did than it is to do the task itself. Or, in other words, you know, you can do the comparisons on tasks-- you can still, like, spot good behavior on tasks that you might not be able to do by yourself.</p><p>And so if you're giving this kind of, like, feedback that lets the system do better than you actually could. And I think that's a very general principle that holds in lots of domains. So, kind of like, you're probably most familiar-- if you studied CS, you know that P versus NP and everyone-- you know, we don't actually know whether they're different, but in practice it seems like NP tasks are just much harder.</p><p>It also applies to lots of other settings, like a lot of professional sports or esports just wouldn't be fun to watch if you couldn't tell who's winning more easily than you could actually compete on a professional level. It applies to a lot of consumer products. You can, like, look at your smartphones and tell which one you like more.</p><p>That is, like, also deeper than just looking at, like, the specs. But it is actually very hard to build a good smartphone. It also applies to academic research. You know, it's much easier to review a paper and say all the things that are bad about it than it is to write a good paper yourself.</p><p>It applies to, I don't know, when you-- yeah, basically there's lots of domains where this applies. And so I think this is, like, a very-- this principle is, like, very useful when we want to, like, align AI systems on tasks that we might not be able to do ourselves well.</p><p>Okay, so having said that, RLHF has some really important limitations. And I think that's going to make it really difficult to use RLHF to scale alignment. Let me explain this with a diagram. So basically, on the x-axis, let's plot, like, the AI progress. And on the y-axis, how difficult different tasks are.</p><p>And then as we have more AI progress, kind of like the tasks that AI-- the difficulty of tasks that AI can do goes up. And, like, one of the fundamental problems is that the level of tasks that humans can reliably evaluate doesn't go up because humans don't get better with AI progress.</p><p>And so I think we're, like, somewhere here. But the problem is, once you cross this line, you don't really know what-- like, whether your model is actually doing the right thing because you can't reliably evaluate anymore. And so that's kind of, like, the point where RLHF training will start to break down.</p><p>And what we'll probably see is kind of what the question before I lead it to is, like, well, now the systems are optimized for whatever feedback we give them. And so they will try to tell us what we want to hear, rather all the things that they know to be true.</p><p>And, you know, they might learn how to deceive us because, you know, that makes it easier to score higher on preferences. And so kind of, like, the basic idea that we want to leverage is related to the principle I just mentioned, which is evaluation is easier in generation. So, for example, if you have a large language model writing a code base, like an entire code base, there's just no way humans would be able to find all the bugs and all the flaws in the code base.</p><p>Or, you know, the code base could have, like, a Trojan in there and you might not be able to tell because it is so hard. And that's why we see so much buggy code out there. But if you ask your language model to find bugs and point them out to you, once you've seen the bug, it's so much easier for you to say, "Oh, yeah, this was a bug.</p><p>Please fix it." And so now you've taken the task of writing a code base down to, "Well, I just have to evaluate whether that was a bug according to the spec that I had in mind." And so the general principle that we're excited about here is, like, we want to leverage AI assistance for human evaluation.</p><p>And so the hope is that we, together, if we pair up humans with AI, you actually get a line that looks more like this, where, you know, like, humans together with AI can evaluate much more than they could on their own. And so to make this concrete, there's, like, two different ways you could do that, or there's many different ways you could do that.</p><p>Two I want to highlight is, like, first, you can ask AI to write a critique. This is a project we did last year. And in this case, it was a simple summarization task, and we trained a language model to kind of, like, to say things that are wrong with the summary.</p><p>And there's other things you could do. For example, you could give people chat GPT and ask them, "Okay, use chat GPT to help you evaluate." And then you could ask for a critique, or you could ask for a lot of other things. You could ask for an explanation. You can ask for fact-checking or a quote or, you know, whatever the model, like, chat GPT can actually reliably help you with.</p><p>And so the idea would be that, you know, like, using AI assistance, you can kind of get all the smarts that AI has and leverage that in order to figure out how you should evaluate what this system is doing and, like, whether it's aligned with your preferences or whether it's trying to deceive you.</p><p>And the big problem with this is how do we know whether it's working? And one of the kind of, like, difficulties is that by assumption, we're kind of dealing with a hard task where it's difficult to evaluate. And we also want the task to be real because we don't want to, you know, we don't want to solve a hard task that doesn't matter.</p><p>And so it becomes different. So you need, like, a hard task that is real. But also, if you have those, you usually don't have ground truth, so you don't know which was the right answer and how do you know whether the assistance is working or it's biasing everyone to just say the same thing.</p><p>And so there's a simple technique that we use in a critique to do this where, like, that we call targeted perturbations. And so what you do is you have a bunch of prompts. So this could be, like, whatever people type into ChatGPT. And then you kind of, like, take the response that you have and say, like, this is the correct response.</p><p>It doesn't actually have to be correct, but let's just assume it is. And now you're asking a human to introduce some kind of subtle flaw that is easy to miss but is an important flaw. And now what you have is you have this pure data set of, like, a good response and a bad response.</p><p>And you know which one is good and bad because you made it worse. And so, you know, in a way, that gives you ground truth. And so what you now can do is you can take, like, randomly select either the correct or the flawed response and then show it to either a human or a human with assistance.</p><p>And then they have to say whether it was the correct or the flawed one or, like, how good the response is. And in this setting, we can kind of, like, figure, like, just try a lot of different AI assistance or scalable oversight techniques and then say, you know, like, is this actually helping humans find the flaws that we wanted more likely than not.</p><p>And if it is, then, you know, like, you're actually really helping. And so we did this in the critiques paper. So this is training the language models to write critiques for summaries. And what we can show is that when we are assisting humans with critiques at the evaluation, they actually find 50% more flaws than it did without.</p><p>And so this is kind of, like, real signs of life that you can already use in models that we can have today to help humans evaluate and, like, find problems they would have missed otherwise. And, of course, we still have to do this, like, on a much harder task and, like, with, like, a real task in a sense.</p><p>And we also want to have, like, bigger effect size. But I think it's just, like, it shows that there's promise of these techniques already working. And so in the long run, what I think we want to get to is we kind of want to leverage AI for all the cognitive labor that goes into evaluating whatever our AI systems are doing.</p><p>And this could be, you know, like, reading everything that's relevant or fact-checking or doing calculations or, like, writing code or any of these things. And then humans should focus on, like, their preference input, like the things figuring out what they actually care about and what they want the model to do.</p><p>And this way we can kind of, like, leverage, you know, like, the abilities that, you know, the AI players will bring to the table and the things that they will be better at than us eventually. And then kind of, like, use them to help communicate the thing that we actually care about and, you know, the things that we actually want them to do.</p><p>And, yeah, that's it. But, yeah, those are, like, the main slides. I'm happy to take more questions. Yes. I was wondering about this hallucination of responses. Have you ever tried to consider some notion of uncertainty in the answers? Yes. So ensembling is difficult because either you're, like, training and fine-tuning an ensemble from the same pre-trained model so you don't get that much variance in your ensemble, or you're pre-training a bunch of different models and now you're spending a lot of money on pre-trainings.</p><p>One thing, I mean, it seems like it should be a solvable problem to just teach the model to say it's uncertain when it's actually uncertain. And there's been a bunch of research in that direction, but I think right now it's still, like, we're not really in a good shape.</p><p>There's more stuff to do. Yeah. Do you think we may run into a kind of signals and noise ratio problem when it comes to AI-suggested critiques to AI answers? Because I'm sure, like, when AI is trying to point out particular problems in text, humans are more likely to report more problems.</p><p>But what if it's noticing problems that humans wouldn't have necessarily had a problem with to begin with? Yeah. So we did try to control for that a little bit by, like, having humans rate the severity of their flaws and whether they would have noticed them otherwise. It can still see a significant effect.</p><p>But also, like, I mean, a lot of the time the model is nitpicking, and then those are, like, not the interesting cases. Yeah. Also, if you, like, look at the example I showed, which I think is from the blog post, like, a lot of the critiques are just actually quite garbage.</p><p>And one of the, like, things that makes it easy for critiques is it's okay if most of them are garbage because the human can just read them and discard them. And it kind of, like, more, you know, helps the evaluator know where to focus on or, like, notice, like, think of something they would have missed otherwise.</p><p>So it's more like, you know, the critiques help you brainstorm how you should evaluate or something. But if you're kind of, like, using an assistant, you probably want more reliability than, like, filling most of the answers of why. Yeah. Yes. How do we ensure that the evaluation metrics we are using in your recursive reward modeling approach, like, detect deception and, like, left turns or something don't have, like, major discontinuity?</p><p>Yeah, I think, well, it depends a lot what kind of discontinuity you're talking about. Like, if, you know, you get overnight, like, a model that is, let's say, 1,000 inches larger on, like, number of parameters or, like, equivalently better, that can, like, create quite a step up and that makes it quite difficult to do this kind of evaluation.</p><p>So in that sense, I think it's going to be very important to, like, scale up AI more continuously and, like, do more incremental steps. Having said that, I think the basic picture with recursive reward modeling is that you're training the systems to help you evaluate, you know, systems that are trained or fine-tuned from the same system, right?</p><p>And so if you can figure out how to get, like, fine-tune them in a way that they mention everything that is actually useful and relevant, then it would still be able to evaluate systems, even though they're much smarter than anything you've evaluated before. Maybe let me make this more concrete because there is, I think, a way that you could measure that or, like, one way we've tried it was using what we call the discriminative critique gap.</p><p>So to measure that, you're training two different, or you're fine-tuning two different models from the same pre-trained model. One is the discriminator, which says, like, is this the flawed response or the correct response or more correct response? And the other one is a critique model that tells you what the flaw was.</p><p>And now you can measure how often did the discriminator get it correctly? And the discriminator is just, like, pure gradient descent. It doesn't have to want to tell you anything. You're just basically hooking into the model's representations and trying to, like, get all the relevant latent insight it has to this prediction task.</p><p>And then on the other hand, you have this critique model or this general assistance model, and you're measuring how often does the assistant actually help me point to the right flaw? And then if you compare these two scores, you can, like, look at the gap between them. Hence, this discriminator critique gap.</p><p>And then if the gap is large, then the model knows a lot about the task it's not telling you. And so that would be very worrying. And if the gap is small, then there's much-- presumably, there's, like, fewer things that the model is, like, not telling you. Yeah, but I guess there's, like, lots of value in ensuring this approach is, like, robust and testing it on That's right.</p><p>That's why we want to test it on the current models. Yes, I don't know who was first. I think someone in the back. So I wanted to ask about, like, maybe towards the end, you had a slide where, like, there was, like,  And so, you know, I couldn't help but notice, like, part of that also is, like, communicating what you want the AI to do, right?</p><p>Right. Like, not just, like, evaluating, but, like, communicating, like, what happens, like, I would like you to do this. And maybe it can't do that. And so, like, at least, like, in my personal experience using the chat GPT, like, there were some things that could do that without surprising.</p><p>Like, you could, like, approach somebody with a terminal, for instance. And I was like, oh, like, how did that come up? Or, you know, like, you can ask about, like, if it's, like-- there's, like, different things, right? Or I'm like, OK, like, what can I ask for? And, like, what kind of-- Yeah.</p><p>One thing that I thought was a bit concerning was just this idea that, like, you know, people don't always communicate their preferences, like, honestly. Or, like, there could be, like, coordinated efforts, right, to, like, instill rewards for, like, specific capabilities, you know, like, a coordinated effort to do such a thing.</p><p>One idea, like, I had with this was, like, I tried to ask if it has, like, some idea of, like, a Wikipedia for itself, right? Because, like, I don't-- I didn't know how to use it at first, so I just thought, like, maybe well, there didn't seem to be one.</p><p>But, like, I was hoping there was one. There was one for, like, GPT-3, right? Like, I think Brockman broke, like, a little unofficially. So I was hoping. And so my question is, like, how do you, like, make that sort of, like, thing safe, right? Like, have you, like, recognized coordinated efforts to, like, you know, like, specifically reward certain kinds of behavior?</p><p>Maybe, like, some group opportunity decides that they would like to-- Yeah. --you know, give it some capability. So this is a-- You know, like-- Yeah, this is a really good question. And, like, in a way-- I mean, the first obvious thing that you shouldn't do is, like, you shouldn't just, like, literally turn in the data that people give through, like, using interface.</p><p>And we've kind of, like, seen other examples of what happens if you do that. If you think of, like, Microsoft Pay or something, that can go pretty wrong. The other thing is-- I mean, right now, what we're doing is, like, we're hiring a bunch of people and then ask them to rate different model responses.</p><p>But also, now the question becomes, like, you know, who are we hiring? And, like, what's their background? What are they trying to do? And so-- And in particular, like, the thing I think we're doing quite poorly right now is, like, actually, like, importing, like, a diverse and representative set of human preferences.</p><p>And it's more just, like, you know, whoever we end up, we can hire. And so I kind of wish there was also just, like, more targeted research on, like, how we should do that and how that could be done well. And some of it is also, like, you know, better placed outside of, like, big tech companies.</p><p>Because if you are-- like, tech companies always have an incentive to, like, you know, import human preferences in a way that maybe is not, like, the thing that we actually-- humanity would do under a reflection or something. And so I think it's a really big, important question. There's a slight follow-up.</p><p>Like, data contamination is, like, the dual problem for this. Like, do you think the internet might be contaminated with-- Obvious. Yeah. I mean-- Do you have, like-- is that something-- People might-- can-- anyone can poison the free training, right? Just put something on the internet. And it's, you know, something that we have to be very mindful of.</p><p>Yes. I don't know. Have you thought much about, like, considering that we're currently training these models  and hopefully getting closer to human preferences at this point. As human preferences change, we've seen, like,  quite drastically. Is there something-- like, is it a paradigm? Is it a models keeping up with data better?</p><p>Like, that's, like, a very complex problem. Yeah. I mean, the most obvious thing is it's, like-- the model's knowledge base is kind of like the free training cut-out date. Like, somebody-- you know, whatever data you went into pre-training, it doesn't know about, like, a lot of things that happened after that.</p><p>In terms of updating kind of, like, human preferences or the, you know, like, the comparisons that go into the robot model, you just collect more data and retrain. And the fine-tuning run is, like, comparatively cheap. So you can, you know, do that again. I think what gets harder is that, you know, like, as you've deployed the model and people started using it for all kinds of, you know, tasks that they want to build their company around, like, they-- if you update and you change the model, then they also have to do a bunch of work into, like, adopting their prompts to whatever they're doing.</p><p>And so it doesn't come at a zero cost. Yes. Sorry. You. So on the note of exceeding human level performance, one of the advantages of GPT-3 is that it has this immense corpus of the entire internet. If you want to specialize in a specific domain, like chemistry or material science or something, and potentially to generate new compounds, then GPT-3 adapted, like, to use less data and still learn as efficiently.</p><p>You mean, like, less data on, like, the chemical domain or something? Yeah. research paper over the last 30 years or something. Yeah. And you can throw that into pre-training, right? And then the model knows about it. But can the model really learn this effectively without so much data? Or can we somehow adapt the abstract concepts behind GPT-3 before that's over?</p><p>Yeah. I mean, that's kind of the general idea with what you intend to do with fine tuning. And to some extent, we've seen it, like, generalized in this way. For example, InstructGPT was trained almost entirely on English language feedback and demonstrations. And it works in other languages. And so that's kind of wild.</p><p>And so similarly, you could train the model with people who don't know anything about chemistry. And then it learns to follow instructions. And it will do so on the topic of chemistry. And this fine tuning can be very sample efficient. Like, with 100 data points, you can actually make a meaningful change in the model behavior.</p><p>So it can be quite effective. I'm going to pick someone who hasn't asked. Yes. Regarding response generation, do you or how much effort do you put on or do you put emphasis in training on different expression styles? So what I've noticed from GPT-3 that it always gives you, like, very structured or scientifically structured answers.</p><p>Do you consider any training if it returns you, like, a scientifically structured answer or rather an asterisk answer? Yeah. I mean, the tricky thing is, ideally, the model should give you the kind of answer that you want to have. Right? And some people prefer a more scientific or technical answer.</p><p>Some people might prefer a more generic answer. And I mean, right now, like, ChatGPT doesn't have, like, you know, a way for you to set, like, your specific preferences. And that's something that would be really exciting to have. But also, I think the kind of statistic property that you've observed is, in fact, like, probably a product of our labeler pool.</p><p>And so a lot of the ChatGPT workers were, like, more, you know, like, I think more, like, computer science-y and, like, more-- there was, like, more data generated by programmers compared to InstructGPT, which was more, like, generalist labelers. And yeah, there's, like, different-- it's, like, kind of-- it changes also the style.</p><p>So there is no specific effort to distinguish that, but you can. Yeah. I mean, we should make a distinguished effort. It should give you, like, the style that you want, right? Yes. So one of the things that I've been thinking about, honestly, is how ChatGPT is going to play a factor in the education of the younger generation or the coming generation.</p><p>And so if you go back to the graph of the AI progress and the human level-- yeah, what humans can evaluate, what I'm starting to think about is, like, over a break, I have used this. I showed, like, my 10-year-old cousin how to compare ChatGPT just to mess around with.</p><p>And that green line is a lot lower, right? And furthermore, if said just becomes part of their educational experience, it's going to be much-- or I perceive it to be more difficult for them to discriminate even simpler tasks than what we do now. And so I'm already thinking about, like, how that might disrupt or make this alignment a little bit more difficult in the long run, as you have people who are more-- who take, for instance, what ChatGPT says as a given truth anyway.</p><p>I was just wondering what your thoughts are on that. I mean, there's a real risk of overlying on a tech that is immature and that is not ready for you just believing-- like, please don't believe everything the model says, right? Right. But also, I think one thing that I'm hopeful for is that, like, your cousin will end up, like, figuring out how to do this, where, like, they grew up with all of these AI tools that are getting better and learning how to actually leverage them productively, right?</p><p>And, like, it's kind of like, you know, 20 years ago or something, when you were, like, using Google Search much earlier than everyone else, you're probably going to get better at, like, using that as a tool for everything you want to do. Any more questions? I think you had your hand up for a while.</p><p>I think the slide where human tasks and the chat tasks and the model tasks, right? The AI tasks. Oh, wait, the last one? The last one. Yeah, so right now, it seems like you guys are using humans as biological sensors to the real world, to, like, physical ground truth, and using language as, like, a compressed interface to that ground truth.</p><p>Are you guys also looking at using accessor technology directly with your models to get a more truthful answer of, you know-- Yeah. I mean, it depends on what that sensor could be, right? Like, I guess, like, one of the most straightforward things is you could ask the model to browse, and then it can, like, fact check its own answers, and it can, you know, like, import external knowledge that it didn't remember.</p><p>And yeah, I think that would be quite useful. I think that would also be quite useful for assisting human evaluation. And you can look at WebGBT, which, you know, is a published work on using the model for browsing. I think-- so one thing that makes it harder when you're using these, like, external sensors, or if you're letting the model interact more directly with the real world is that it raises more safety questions, right?</p><p>If you let your language model make arbitrary API calls, then you have to be a lot more careful with which calls it's allowed to make, and which is it not. And if you're-- as opposed to if you're just, like, you're reviewing everything the model says, then you can decide which ones you want to make.</p><p>So yeah. It's an open problem. OK. One more question. I think you did. About the reasoning abilities of these model language models. I've seen, like, different people talk about how it's only, like, a fixed amount of compute per token, while, like, humans, they have system one and system two, where we can, like, just speak quickly versus, like, actually do some reasoning and think through things that take more effort.</p><p>And then I've seen other works that try to, like, kind of use-- to force it to a chain of prompt or a chain of, like, reasoning, or, like, just think step by step and stuff. Do you think that stuff is sufficient to do, like, everything that's two-level what we want, or will it require real, big fine-tuning or architectural changes?</p><p>I don't know. I'm also the wrong person to ask. I'm mostly not trying to get the models to have new capabilities, and more, like, you know, getting them to play on Team Human. Oh, do we want to do the online questions? Yeah. Sorry. So what do you think is the-- is there a role for playing from the feedback, especially if you have, like, human-- like, you don't have to play chatbots.</p><p>It's hard to model human interactions. So do you think, like, this would be more popping out? Yeah, quite possibly. I mean, yeah, as you point out, right, like, there is a lot of conversational data. And if you can use it, that would be-- should be useful. I think, broadly, you can categorize this kind of thing as, like, let's make the RL algorithm better and, like, RL from the feedback.</p><p>And I think that's valuable, and that should help us, like, make the same pre-trained models, like, more aligned according to the human preferences that we collected. But also, you would still run into, like, all the limitations that RLHF has, right? Also, if, like, someone wants to use RLHF on, like, the GPT-3 models, will OpenAI offer some sort of API for that?</p><p>I think there's a fine-tuning API for GPT-3. I don't think it offers RL right now. Got it. But it's supervised fine-tuning. So you could do, like-- you can, like, distill best of M and do this kind of expert iteration RL. Got it. So I'll try to move on to the questions.</p><p>So the first question is, could you more clearly describe the pre-training process for chat GPT? For example, starting with the text wc001, then xdb of programming data, y steps of RLHF. Sorry. I didn't catch that. Start with text wc001. And then, so how much ease of data do you use?</p><p>And how many steps of RLHF kind of things? I think the exact numbers are not public. It's basically similar to Instruct GPT. And for the Instruct GPT numbers, we had, I think, around 50,000 comparisons, and probably, like, 10,000 demonstrations, or, like, maybe tens of thousands. I don't remember the exact number.</p><p>And so I had, like, this other slide with-- yeah, it was, like, about 20,000 hours of human feedback, is what I calculated. And do you think it's human feedback, because that's-- you can get, like, 1 million or whatever Right. I mean, the big question is, like, how do you make-- how do you ensure quality?</p><p>But that's the whole problem, right? Like, that assumes you already have their one model that you trust. So-- OK. Sure. So the next question, I think, that I was told was, you want to automate alignment research. What happens if you need conceptual visuals, which are difficult for experts to verify?</p><p>Yeah, so, I mean, the kind of, like, ambition of that plan is to train a model that can do this kind of conceptual research. And, you know, you can picture, like, a language model that, like, you know, writes an alignment research paper that we read, and then we're like, oh, this is a really cool idea.</p><p>We should try this. And I think, you know, going back to evaluation, it's easier in generation. I think it also applies to alignment research. And, like, I think, at the very least, like, I find it much easier to evaluate, you know, alignment research than I find it to, like, produce it.</p><p>And so while there might be conceptual breakthroughs that we need that we couldn't even evaluate right now because they're just, like, you know, if we saw them, we'd be like, what is this? And this is kind of, like, this is, like, the reason why we want to do scalable oversight, right?</p><p>Because, you know, like, if, you know, the language model produces this really brilliant insight and we can't even recognize it at the time, we should be able to have an easier time recognizing it if we use AI assistance. And if we leverage, like, our best AI models to, like, figure out whether or not that was a good idea, what is the weaknesses and what are the strengths?</p><p>And, like, you know, what kind of experiments should we run to know whether this is a good idea? And so, yeah, I think basically, you know, the story of just using LLHF to train a model to do good alignment research, you have the obvious pitfalls, which is, you know, the model might write, like, an alignment proposal that kind of looks good to us, but is actually, you know, not a good proposal, and it creates AI that is misaligned with humans.</p><p>And so in order to distinguish the two, which might be really hard, maybe it's not, but, you know, I think we should expect it to be really hard, and then leveraging AI assistance to evaluate that seems like a really promising plan. I mean, that was my whole point. It's not suppression.</p><p>I mean, the generalists were, like, I think basically the vast majority of the model's capabilities and, like, all the cool things you see it do come from pre-training and not from the fine-tuning stage. The reason why people sometimes attribute it to the fine-tuning stage is that you didn't see it in the pre-trained model.</p><p>And the reason, I think, the reason that we didn't see it in the pre-trained model is because the pre-written model was so misaligned, it was not trying to help you, and it was not trying to show you all the things it can do. And instead, it just regurgitates a bunch of random web text.</p><p>And that's not what you're looking for. And so, yeah. I think that what our project basically has been doing is, like, unlocking capabilities that were already in the model and making those available for humans to use. And in some ways, like, you know, alignment research is very dual-use in the sense that, you know, A, if you have really good alignment techniques, you can use it to align with whatever values you want, including values that, you know, we wouldn't particularly endorse.</p><p>And B, it also, like, if you're doing alignment right, it will always look a little bit like you made the AI system more capable because before, it just wasn't really trying that hard to help you. And now, you've made it more aligned. So, you know, you actually see these capabilities that you already have.</p><p>Sure. Let's see. Yeah, so that was what I was talking about here, right? Like, this is, like, the whole problem that we have, where what humans can evaluate is constant. And so we won't be able to evaluate, like, sophisticated attempts at deceiving us. And that's why we want to do scalable supervision so that we empower humans to spot these attempts at deception.</p><p>Yeah, so I think these are real worries. And to some extent, we kind of, like, have to test empirically, like, how difficult and how severe they actually are. I think-- so my personal stance right now is something like, I think, trying to get the outer alignment signal really right is going to be, like, 90% of the effort.</p><p>And once we have that, then a lot of the other things might also fall into place. So for example, I mean, it kind of depends on which story of inner misalignment you're worried about. But, you know, one story is you're kind of training your system, and it learns how to do-- it learns, basically, a bunch of inner optimizers, kind of like meta reinforcement learning.</p><p>So for example, like, GPT-3 can do, like, in-context learning. And that's, like, a kind of, you know, learned optimizer. And so now you're, like, doing all that GIF training or whatever, like, alignment training you have. And you're, like, the learned optimizers learn to do the thing that you want on distribution.</p><p>But now if you have a distributional shift-- and this distributional shift could be auto-induced, meaning, like, the model is causing it itself. And now you're going out of distribution. All these inner optimizers, like, try to optimize for something else. And one way you can, like-- and, you know, like, how much that would actually happen in practice is kind of unclear.</p><p>But one kind of, like, more important question is, like, if you have a really reliable outer alignment signal and you have this, like, general training signal that you trust, you can also use that, you know, on the new distribution to train the system to be more-- or, like, to get its inner optimizers in a row, basically.</p><p>And so then you've reduced, like, the inner alignment problems to, like, how do you deal with a distributional shift? And how do you, like, construct an outer alignment signal that you trust? And those are problems that we have to deal with anyways. But yeah, I don't know how it's actually going to shake out.</p><p>But there's some important open questions. So regarding alignments, one of the kind of problems that I've been encountering in some discussions is there's not much interest, it seems, in, like, explaining why we come to these judgments or these lack thereof. There's not even been much interest in the way I would decompose these models.</p><p>It's, like, explaining why this-- and even set constraints arbitrarily. I mean, that's definitely a truthful route is to be able to show this. But as to why it's making these out-of-line judgments, have you all been able to interrogate the model? I mean, I think where we are right now is, like, pretty dissatisfactory.</p><p>I mean, you can ask the model why it gave a certain response. But you don't know whether it's answering truthfully. And you can also-- I mean, another thing you can do is you can give the model its own response and ask it to find out flaws, which is what we did in the Geeks paper.</p><p>But, you know, I think that, like-- I mean, there's one version where you try to make that better. But then the question is, like, what is your ground truth signal? I think a, like, better angle of attack is probably interpretability, where, you know, you figure out how to look inside the model and then how it actually works.</p><p>That's what I was asking about, like, the level of research of interpretability. Yeah. It's like, it seems as though that's been really difficult to do for you because you are going through models in particular, and that's such a high-critical space. Yeah. Your current thinking is moving towards  reducing the missionality of that representation  Yeah, I mean, we are working on that problem.</p><p>But I don't think we have anything that to show right now. And so it seems generally not to be a very easy problem. But, you know, I'm hopeful that we can do some things. I think, in general, the problem of interpretability, or, like, using interpretability for alignment, is kind of tricky because I suspect it's going to be neither-- it's going to be not sufficient.</p><p>And it might not be necessary. So any amount of interpretability you can leverage would be useful because it's another tool in your toolbox of, like, detecting deception or, like, knowing what you said, like, how-- why the model gave a certain answer and made a certain decision. But, you know, it is kind of unclear if you really get really good at interpretability, how you then leverage that for alignment.</p><p>Like, presumably, you can look in the model and just, like, throw all the models out that you can find a misalignment in. But then aren't you just selecting for models that have misalignments that are really hard to find with the interpretability tools? - Sure. Just a follow-up to that.</p><p>It's-- really, my aspect of that is kind of the standard practice that we have in general is that you have to find explanations of the problem. - Yeah. - And I guess then my question would be is, like, why would you take the interpretability to not be necessary? - Yes.</p><p>- Why would it not be necessary? So, again, this is kind of, like, an open question. But basically, what stance you could take is that at the end of the day, what really is going to matter is the decisions that the model actually takes and not the reasons why it took them.</p><p>And so if you can get to the point where you're confident that all the things the model actually does are aligned with what you want, then does it still matter what the model thinks internally? I don't know. - But you have to find out, too. You have to find out, like, if that value would be more valid than the model.</p><p>- Yeah. That's what we're trying to do, right? Like, we're trying to make, like, a really, really good evaluation signal. And then you can select for-- you know, you can train the model to do the things that you want it to do because you can always evaluate better than the model can do stuff.</p><p>Yeah. - I'll probably have my shot at that. That's my question. - Very good. Thanks so much, Dion, for the great lecture. Very interesting. - I might actually do, like-- as we're talking about the topic of connectivity, I might just do, like, a live-- I want just, like, an application thing.</p><p>- Yeah, sure. Sure. - Just to end up the class. Sorry. So how do you find this thing? - Oh, you need-- - All right, guys. Can we give our speaker a round of applause? - Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you.</p><p>- Thank you.</p></div></div></body></html>
