I wish I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQVxv4ha8AY&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">were that kind of person.

John Bloom is like that. He just seems to be singing. I don't do that. I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQVxv4ha8AY&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.200</a></span> | <span class="t">have to say, "Oh, it would be good to sing. Let's sing." So I'm kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQVxv4ha8AY&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.560</a></span> | <span class="t">preaching to myself here.

I don't like it. I don't like having to be told</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQVxv4ha8AY&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to sing. I wish I were the kind of person who just sang. So anyway, I'm not, and I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQVxv4ha8AY&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.480</a></span> | <span class="t">talking to me and anybody like me. It seems to me that the psalmists sang and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQVxv4ha8AY&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">encouraged us to sing, not just in the great congregation. They did all the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQVxv4ha8AY&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Sing in the great congregation. But I think when they got up in the morning,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQVxv4ha8AY&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.600</a></span> | <span class="t">here's Psalm 57, "I will sing and make melody. Awake, my glory. Awake, O harp and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQVxv4ha8AY&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">lyre. I will awake the dawn." So he's like, wakes up in the morning, "I'm gonna sing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQVxv4ha8AY&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">the sun up." Or Psalm 108, same thing, "My heart is steadfast, O God. I will sing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQVxv4ha8AY&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and make melody with all my being. Awake, awake, O harp and lyre. I will awake the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQVxv4ha8AY&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">dawn." That seems to be like, I haven't gone to church. I haven't gone to the temple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQVxv4ha8AY&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.640</a></span> | <span class="t">or to the synagogue. I'm just bringing up the sun with my song. Or Psalm 59,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQVxv4ha8AY&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">"I will sing of your strength. I will sing aloud of your steadfast love in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQVxv4ha8AY&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.640</a></span> | <span class="t">morning, for you have been to me a fortress." He just seems to be overwhelmed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQVxv4ha8AY&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.480</a></span> | <span class="t">by God's strength in his life, and he wants to wake up the morning with it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQVxv4ha8AY&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.280</a></span> | <span class="t">It's the overflow of joy. "My heart shall rejoice in your salvation. I will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQVxv4ha8AY&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">sing to the Lord because he has dealt bountifully with me." So has the Lord</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQVxv4ha8AY&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">dealt bountifully with you? Well, the response of the psalmist was, "I will sing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQVxv4ha8AY&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">to the Lord." That would be maybe a good response to add to whatever your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQVxv4ha8AY&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.520</a></span> | <span class="t">responses are to the bounty of the Lord. And he seemed to sing to the Lord when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQVxv4ha8AY&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">he woke up at night. Psalm 63, "When I remember you upon my bed and meditate on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQVxv4ha8AY&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">you in the watches of the night, for you have been my help and in the shadow of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQVxv4ha8AY&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.520</a></span> | <span class="t">your wings I will sing for joy." So he's not just singing at church. It seems to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQVxv4ha8AY&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">be something that he just considered part of his being. He said, "I will sing to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQVxv4ha8AY&t=302" target="_blank">00:05:02.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Lord as long as I live.

And Paul, I mean, if you leave the Psalms</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQVxv4ha8AY&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.440</a></span> | <span class="t">behind and go over to Paul, here's an amazing thing he said in 1 Corinthians</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQVxv4ha8AY&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.440</a></span> | <span class="t">14, "What am I to do? I will pray with my spirit and I will pray with my mind also.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQVxv4ha8AY&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I will sing praise with my spirit and I will sing with my mind also." He's talking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQVxv4ha8AY&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.640</a></span> | <span class="t">about tongues there, and sometimes he's in the spirits singing in tongues and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQVxv4ha8AY&t=338" target="_blank">00:05:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">sometimes he's not. And so it seems like part of Paul's personal devotions was he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQVxv4ha8AY&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.120</a></span> | <span class="t">sang by himself. And James said this, "Is anyone among you suffering?" James 5, "Let</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQVxv4ha8AY&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.680</a></span> | <span class="t">him pray." Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing praise. So that probably didn't mean</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQVxv4ha8AY&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.120</a></span> | <span class="t">wait till you get to church.
