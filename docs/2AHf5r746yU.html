here?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=960" target="_blank">00:16:00.460</a></span> | <span class="t">What am I missing?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=961" target="_blank">00:16:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't, I don't know that I'd say you're missing anything, but I think to emphasize a few of your points, I mean, you mentioned having a document for your systems, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=969" target="_blank">00:16:09.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So that you can do much more deliberate experimentation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=972" target="_blank">00:16:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=972" target="_blank">00:16:12.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that is absolutely a theme with a lot of people that I researched is that they have one way or another, their experimentation is, is very deliberate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=981" target="_blank">00:16:21.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=981" target="_blank">00:16:21.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So like when I was writing about generalists, like you can become someone who just pinballs around and is kind of trying things intuitively at all times.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=987" target="_blank">00:16:27.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Sure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=988" target="_blank">00:16:28.260</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think the people who became productive through this experiments had some system where it was like, here's the thing I'm going to try.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=995" target="_blank">00:16:35.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=995" target="_blank">00:16:35.460</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to come back and reflect on did that meet my expectations or not?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=998" target="_blank">00:16:38.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And where do I pivot next from that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=999" target="_blank">00:16:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's a whole literature about what's called self regulatory learning that has to do with this, where, you know, you say it basically, if I had to boil down this massive, uh, body of literature comes down to reflection, like having a deliberate system for reflection.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=1014" target="_blank">00:16:54.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So like when I was trying to write my first book, I'd never written a piece of anything longer than like 7000 words and suddenly after 90,000 or 100,000 and I actually talked to a researcher, this woman named Mariah Elfrink Gemser, who does self regulatory learning research.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=1029" target="_blank">00:17:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And she said, start your journal, say, you know, what do I need to learn next?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=1035" target="_blank">00:17:15.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Why do I need to learn it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=1038" target="_blank">00:17:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Am I sure I need to learn it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=1039" target="_blank">00:17:19.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=1039" target="_blank">00:17:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Who do I need to help me learn it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=1041" target="_blank">00:17:21.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=1041" target="_blank">00:17:21.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Then you make a hypothesis about how you're going to learn about it, run an experiment, come back, reflect on what worked, what didn't, and then make your next experiment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=1048" target="_blank">00:17:28.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And that that sort of system of deliberate experimentation, I think, is like ubiquitous.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=1053" target="_blank">00:17:33.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=1053" target="_blank">00:17:33.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's what, if we're thinking about generalist, which your book talks about the advantage of that approach, what makes generalism, if I can invent a term successful, is it has to be coupled to structure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=1064" target="_blank">00:17:44.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=1065" target="_blank">00:17:45.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Otherwise it could just become an, I'm sure people use it as an excuse for like, let me just bounce to what's interesting to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=1071" target="_blank">00:17:51.060</a></span> | <span class="t">That's right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=1071" target="_blank">00:17:51.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you don't have a structure to actually capture the, the feedback, what's working, what's not working.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=1077" target="_blank">00:17:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, in my old days, when I would do student advice, used to have this phrase we would use, which was study like Darwin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=1083" target="_blank">00:18:03.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And it particularly just looking at studying, we would say like the number one thing you can do, forget any particular system is after you try a way for studying for a test, after you try a particular method for writing a paper, et cetera, go back and say, how did this work?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=1104" target="_blank">00:18:24.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Did this work?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=1105" target="_blank">00:18:25.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, could something work better?</span></div><div

evolve.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=1109" target="_blank">00:18:29.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Totally.</span></div><div

have something I call my, my book of small experiments also where like at least every other month I forced myself to come up with some hypothesis about something I think I'm interested in that usually has to do with expanding my own skill or knowledge base.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=1179" target="_blank">00:19:39.560</a></span>

everything like it doesn't spending a little more time reflecting on the stuff they're doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=1534" target="_blank">00:25:34.260</a></span> | <span class="t">There's like whether you're looking at athletes or like I was just reading a paper about surgical teams that one team spends a hundred percent

everything yes, because I think I think this this again this body of literature on self regulatory learning suggests that we don't get all of the learning signal out of the things we do purely just by doing it living through them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=1581" target="_blank">00:26:21.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And in

herself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=2429" target="_blank">00:40:29.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Exactly.</span></div><div

home.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=2444" target="_blank">00:40:44.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, that's the

suppose you have self regulatory journaling, which is about tracking things you're doing and how it went.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=2486" target="_blank">00:41:26.060</a></span> | <span class="t">It's about journal as a feedback mechanism.</span></div><div class="c"><span

capture, getting ideas out of your head so that you don't have to hold onto them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=2498"

in the terms of a more experimental sense, but just where am I, your emotions out?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=2510"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=2514" target="_blank">00:41:54.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I think so.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=2515" target="_blank">00:41:55.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's the, I don't know to what degree that dovetails with like the morning words.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=2519" target="_blank">00:41:59.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you know that that routine that a lot of writers have?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=2521" target="_blank">00:42:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, you do a 15 minute do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=2523" target="_blank">00:42:03.560</a></span> | <span

the idea there is it sort of gets you out of perfectionism, like you're just going and letting your letting your thoughts flow up, flow out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=2531" target="_blank">00:42:11.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's also this course sort of warming up aspect to it.</span></div><div

we're underappreciating is that smartphones with ubiquitous high-speed wireless internet has created this incredibly novel environment in the history of the human species in which you can banish every

is, um, if you want the benefits of self-reflective journalism, journaling, like one of the simplest things you could do has nothing to do with a physical journal.</span></div><div class="c"><span

you're in line and you're forced to be alone with your own thoughts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=2630"

target="_blank">00:43:52.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Human instinct is wired to basically self-reflect and try to make sense of the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=2636" target="_blank">00:43:56.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's almost like getting rid of the thing that prevents self-reflection could be just as important as having the right tool to actually direct your self-reflection.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=2646"

think about what things we can add to be better stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=2660" target="_blank">00:44:20.360</a></span> |

wants to be a millionaire.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=2882" target="_blank">00:48:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And because he had studied semantic network and memory, he knew that like, if you picture a spider web, if memories are sort of attached by different threads of the web, if you can bring up one that's related, it'll shake the web and you might, it might bring up the others that are connected.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=2896" target="_blank">00:48:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So he said, when you go on who wants to be a millionaire, what they don't show you is that you can like talk to the host as long as you want before you have to guess.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=2901" target="_blank">00:48:21.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And they

keep talking, talking, talking, talking in the hope that the conversation would trigger some semantic association.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

correct, but it already decided to walk with a half million.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=2914"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=2917" target="_blank">00:48:37.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And it would come up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=2918" target="_blank">00:48:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It would trigger his own semantic network.</span></div><div class="c"><span

Correct. And so if that's your take on it, I think you look at, well, how does this thing work as a job? What are like the skills and tools that I need?

Like nothing happy that's going New York Daily News happens to be midnight and 10 a.m.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=3407" target="_blank">00:56:47.960</a></span> | <span class="t">As you can imagine, but that gave me this great ability to do street reporting, right?

Now I'm around people who do long form writing who are way better than me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=3427" target="_blank">00:57:07.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Every day I'm around people who are way, way better than me. So now I'm getting this these skills of even though I'm not doing the writing. Yeah. I'm having to go through their writing in fine detail and sort of understanding how that works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=3438" target="_blank">00:57:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">How did you figure out that's the way in? I had I had wanted to get into Sports Illustrated. I had this specific interest in writing about sudden cardiac death and athletes basically.

And it took me like two years of doing that before they said somebody's going on maternity leave. We have a temp opening for a fact checker. Would you like to leave your real job and come do this? So you were saying, great, I'm just looking for a way to get in that door.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=3465" target="_blank">00:57:45.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Absolutely, because I was looking for a way to get around the people that were doing the kind of things that I wanted to learn how to do.

And then and then once I got that skill set and I felt like my learning curve was tapering off, I left to become an I had like a office on the 32nd floor of a building above Sixth Avenue, big window door and everything at Sports Illustrated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=3483" target="_blank">00:58:03.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I became a senior writer and then I left to be an intern at then startup ProPublica doing investigative stuff because I said, how do I learn how do I get around people who know how to do this thing that I don't know how to do? So I just looked at it as what are instead of this whole big insurmountable, how do I just get to that place? Yeah. What are like the tools I need to put in the toolbox and how do I start going about that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=3502" target="_blank">00:58:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">What was the jump from fact checking to writing within Sports Illustrated? I mean, I guess I'm assuming once you're once you're there and you know people and you're fact checking, you've been sending them stuff for years. It's a much smaller leap to say, hey, can I pitch this or pitch that? I mean, you're in the building, but I got when I started pitching stuff, I was getting shot down. I mean, I was like, you know, just a temp, but then but they would hear it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=3522" target="_blank">00:58:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">They would hear it and it turned out I had this oddball background, right? I came in with this science background. I had a crime reporting background. And so all of a sudden I realized that those were huge assets because I was different than the other people I was around. Yeah. So whereas I was like shaping up to be, I would say like a pretty normal scientist. You take those like typical science skills and you put them in a sports magazine. Yeah. Now you're like a Nobel laureate, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=3544" target="_blank">00:59:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so you had to figure out also how can I fit in what I can do to what they're looking for? Yeah, and that's where they're like, okay. Yeah, you can try this art. What was the first article that they accepted from you to go right? The first article I ever wrote was and really I was just sent out to report on it. Give that reporting to someone else for the magazine. But I then wrote my own version on the website and it was where the backup kicker at the University of Northern Colorado had stabbed the starter in his kicking leg to try and get me to write a book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=3572" target="_blank">00:59:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">to the starter in his kicking leg to try to take his job being driven crazy by his like football</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=3577" target="_blank">00:59:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">obsessed mom. Yeah and they're like, don't you have some crime reporting experience? Get out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=3582" target="_blank">00:59:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">there and so I'm like it was very New York scene. I give like a cabby a hundred bucks like take me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=3585" target="_blank">00:59:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">to the airport, you know right away. Yeah, and and so I was just supposed to give that reporting to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=3589" target="_blank">00:59:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">one of the more senior writers. So, he could write his like essay on it and then I did like sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=3592" target="_blank">00:59:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the more normal version online and they were like, huh? Like I guess if crime stuff comes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=3597" target="_blank">00:59:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">up like you're pretty useful, huh? Yeah, because you've been doing it so they're like oh we'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=3600" target="_blank">01:00:00.240</a></span> | <span class="t">just post like the facts thing. Yeah. Yeah and the reason why they were saying we need that research</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=3605" target="_blank">01:00:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">for our senior writer to do a long-form piece, but as long as you're doing that, let's get in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=3609" target="_blank">01:00:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">just an article. I said, let me do because he because he was he was like an essay writer. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=3613" target="_blank">01:00:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So he did this essay version and I did like the feature story online. Yeah, right and then I would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=3617" target="_blank">01:00:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">look for other things with their whole so I had fact-checking so I had a I had a job like a day</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=3621" target="_blank">01:00:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">job. Yeah, so I could pay rent or whatever but then I would use any of my extra time to look for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=3626" target="_blank">01:00:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">things that I could pitch or that other things that people weren't weren't covering. I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=3629" target="_blank">01:00:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">that can be really helpful like getting something that's kind of in the industry, but is not nearly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=3635" target="_blank">01:00:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">your dream job, but it it gives you the flexibility to sort of broadens your network. Yeah, right and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=3640" target="_blank">01:00:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">so you can start to look for opportunities and not like be hinging everything on like one project</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=3646" target="_blank">01:00:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">where I'm like, did I get the dream or did I not like step step step step forward? Yeah, right,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=3649" target="_blank">01:00:49.520</a></span> | <span class="t">right. So it's not just you sending like massive long-form pieces of Sports Illustrated. I did try</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=3653" target="_blank">01:00:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">that. Yeah, but it doesn't work didn't work. Yeah, at some point like this is great. I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=3657" target="_blank">01:00:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">it's like, you know, the New Yorker gets a lot of this of like John McPhee</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=3660" target="_blank">01:01:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">the bees.

Yeah, just didn't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=3666" target="_blank">01:01:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, didn't work. Yeah. Yeah. It's interesting. Okay. So if I'm going to summarize this as it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=3670" target="_blank">01:01:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">like it's an evidence-based concrete plan. Yeah. Okay. It's evidence-based like I'm learning about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=3675" target="_blank">01:01:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">this industry and I want to concrete let's say evidence-based concrete feasible plan like this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=3680" target="_blank">01:01:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">is pragmatic that I could maybe get a foot in the door job and then you know, I'm going to find my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=3687" target="_blank">01:01:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">should take me a year or two. I'm going to find my advantage and here's I'm going to try to like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=3690" target="_blank">01:01:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">get my first things published. So it's very pragmatic. It's very evidence-based. There's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=3695" target="_blank">01:01:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">a flip to this though to write which is when the evidence-based concrete plan doesn't work. Yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=3701" target="_blank">01:01:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">then it's probably easier to rip cord and it might not be rip cording on the entire dream,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=3706" target="_blank">01:01:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">but it might be okay. This is not working. I'm not getting the fact-checking job or I have the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=3710" target="_blank">01:01:50.560</a></span> | <span class="t">fact-checking job and I'm just I'm not finding an angle to actually get something published.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=3715" target="_blank">01:01:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">The clarity of the plan maybe gives you the clarity of this is not working. Yeah, I totally I mean</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=3719" target="_blank">01:01:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">again, this is this has been like a theme I think in our conversation today, which is if you have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=3724" target="_blank">01:02:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">something a plan whatever it is the plan doesn't have to be right. Yeah experiment doesn't have to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=3728" target="_blank">01:02:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">be right. Yep, but it gives you something to evaluate your learning and your model of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=3732" target="_blank">01:02:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">world against yeah and to learn to get the maximum amount of learning signal you can make your next</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=3736" target="_blank">01:02:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">move and it could become clear like this vision I had or this plan I had for breaking the magazine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=3739" target="_blank">01:02:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">writing didn't work right like I did I tried sending in the like I did this masterpiece</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=3744" target="_blank">01:02:24.240</a></span> | <span class="t">thousands of words. Yeah, that was the first plan. I'm like, yeah, okay that didn't and in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=3747" target="_blank">01:02:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">retrospect. I'm like, well, obviously that plan wasn't going to work, but I had to learn that by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=3751" target="_blank">01:02:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">trying it. Yeah, so then you get a more detailed plan and yeah, so that's good. So the flip side</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=3755" target="_blank">01:02:35.520</a></span> | <span class="t">then is it also teaches you like, okay, this is not working. So maybe I need to try something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=3758" target="_blank">01:02:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">different.

I think that's oftentimes what a lot of people learn that it's not what they thought</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=3767" target="_blank">01:02:47.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and maybe there's some aspect of it.

I'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=4411" target="_blank">01:13:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">show a little bit of the video here on the screen for those who are watching. So who you're seeing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=4416" target="_blank">01:13:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">on the screen here, this is Louis Van Aan, A-H-A-N, from Guatemala, who is talking about,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=4424" target="_blank">01:13:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I believe he's the founder of Duolingo, which is software that helps you learn foreign languages.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=4433" target="_blank">01:13:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know if you've used it before. A little bit. A little bit. And so the point of this talk,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=4437" target="_blank">01:13:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">here's his title, "How to Make Learning as Addictive as Social Media." All right,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=4445" target="_blank">01:14:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">so what's going on here is he's saying, "Look, I designed Duolingo in a way to use some of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=4450" target="_blank">01:14:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">same mechanisms that attention economy platforms use to try to keep you using their apps all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=4455" target="_blank">01:14:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">time. We should use these same ideas when it comes to productive learning, like learning a new</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=4459" target="_blank">01:14:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">language.

So it's an interesting idea that is sparking debate, both in favor of this and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=4472" target="_blank">01:14:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">both people who have some concerns about it. So I thought it would be worth talking a little bit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=4476" target="_blank">01:14:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">here on the show. So I'll give you my thought and then Dave, you can give me your reaction</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=4482" target="_blank">01:14:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">to how you're thinking about it. To me, I think we're talking about two different motivational</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=4488" target="_blank">01:14:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">centers. I don't necessarily mean literally in terms of these are distinct in the brain,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=4492" target="_blank">01:14:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">but just from a cognitive science abstraction point of view. There's two different motivational</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=4497" target="_blank">01:14:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">centers that are relevant here. So there's a motivational center that's going to offer you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=4502" target="_blank">01:15:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">in the moment, it responds to, I'm going to be offered in the moment, some sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=4506" target="_blank">01:15:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">immediately gratifying stimulus. So that's the motivational center. That's like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=4511" target="_blank">01:15:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to grab these potato chips or I'm going to just load up Twitter because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=4515" target="_blank">01:15:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">immediately it's going to show me people yelling about things that I kind of care about. I'm going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=4519" target="_blank">01:15:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">to feel good or righteous or upset.

So if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=5078" target="_blank">01:24:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">play a game in arcade today, it's like, if I take my kids to Dave and busters or something like this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=5082" target="_blank">01:24:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and like you're playing at the arcade games, they've engineered out.

They've minimized what you actually try to do. There's,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=5110" target="_blank">01:25:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">there's no friction into it. Or like I was in the computers as a kid, there was so much friction</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=5114" target="_blank">01:25:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">being in the computers in like 1991.

Oh, okay. Cause I have this, this is my theory. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=5141" target="_blank">01:25:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's been borne out is like, you can games that cost a lot of money are typically games that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=5146" target="_blank">01:25:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">are designed for a closed gameplay experience. It's a certain number of hours and then you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=5151" target="_blank">01:25:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">done like Zelda or something like this. And they're hard. And so you play for a little while</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=5156" target="_blank">01:25:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and it's fun and then it's tough and you get kind of bored with it. It's very, if a game is cheap,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=5160" target="_blank">01:26:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">then their entire business model, if it's free or cost a dollar, the entire business model is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=5164" target="_blank">01:26:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">we want you to play this as long as possible. Right. So like if I give my kid a Nintendo switch,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=5168" target="_blank">01:26:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">like they'll play for a while, Zelda or whatever, a world war II simulation, aviation game. And you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=5174" target="_blank">01:26:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">get kind of bored. It's kind of hard. But if one of my kids gets their hands, we learned this the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=5177" target="_blank">01:26:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">hard way on an iPad with games, they'll just like obsessively just switch from thing to thing. It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=5183" target="_blank">01:26:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">this weird sort of a stimulation trance because most of the iPad games are designed around</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=5190" target="_blank">01:26:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">engagement.

Right. Whereas when I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=5229" target="_blank">01:27:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">in the environment where there was like always something happening, I never had to come up with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=5232" target="_blank">01:27:12.720</a></span> | <span class="t">that. You have to think about it. So I did. Yeah. Yeah. So so we a similar effect could be going on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=5236" target="_blank">01:27:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">now with people where I never have to actually like think of what I want to do to get rid of my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AHf5r746yU&t=5240" target="_blank">01:27:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">boredom.
