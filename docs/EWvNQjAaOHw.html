So in this video, I would like to continue our general audience series on large</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=5" target="_blank">00:00:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">language models like Chatsheepd. Now, in the previous video, "Deep Dive into LLMs" that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=10" target="_blank">00:00:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">can find on my YouTube, we went into a lot of the under the hood fundamentals of how these models</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=14" target="_blank">00:00:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">are trained and how you should think about their cognition or psychology. Now, in this video,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=20" target="_blank">00:00:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to go into more practical applications of these tools. I want to show you lots of examples,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=25" target="_blank">00:00:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to take you through all the different settings that are available, and I want to show</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=29" target="_blank">00:00:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">you how I use these tools and how you can also use them in your own life and work. So let's dive in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=35" target="_blank">00:00:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so first of all, the web page that I have pulled up here is chatsheepd.com. Now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=40" target="_blank">00:00:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">as you might know, Chatsheepd was developed by OpenAI and deployed in 2022. So this was the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=46" target="_blank">00:00:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">first time that people could actually just kind of like talk to a large language model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=49" target="_blank">00:00:49.760</a></span> | <span class="t">through a text interface, and this went viral and all over the place on the internet,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=54" target="_blank">00:00:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and this was huge. Now, since then though, the ecosystem has grown a lot. So I'm going to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=59" target="_blank">00:00:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">showing you a lot of examples of Chatsheepd specifically, but now in 2025, there's many</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=65" target="_blank">00:01:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">other apps that are kind of like Chatsheepd-like, and this is now a much bigger and richer ecosystem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=70" target="_blank">00:01:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So in particular, I think Chatsheepd by OpenAI is this original gangster incumbent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=76" target="_blank">00:01:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">It's most popular and most feature-rich also, because it's been around the longest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=80" target="_blank">00:01:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But there are many other kinds of clones available, I would say. I don't think it's too unfair to say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=85" target="_blank">00:01:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">but in some cases, there are kind of like unique experiences that are not found in Chatsheepd,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=89" target="_blank">00:01:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and we're going to see examples of those. So for example, Big Tech has followed with a lot of kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.920</a></span> | <span class="t">of Chatsheepd-like experiences. So for example, Gemini, Meta.ai, and Copilot from Google, Meta,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=100" target="_blank">00:01:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and Microsoft respectively. And there's also a number of startups. So for example, Anthropic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">has Claude, which is kind of like a Chatsheepd equivalent. XAI, which is Elon's company,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">has Grok. And there's many others. So all of these here are from the United States</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">companies, basically. DeepSeek is a Chinese company, and Le Chat is a French company, Mistral.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=123" target="_blank">00:02:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, where can you find these and how can you keep track of them? Well, number one,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">on the internet somewhere. But there are some leaderboards, and in the previous video,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I've shown you Chatbot Arena is one of them. So here you can come to some ranking of different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">models, and you can see sort of their strength or ELO score. And so this is one place where you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">can keep track of them. I would say another place maybe is this SEAL leaderboard from Scale. And so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">here you can also see different kinds of evals, and different kinds of models, and how well they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">rank. And you can also come here to see which models are currently performing the best on a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">wide variety of tasks. So understand that the ecosystem is fairly rich, but for now I'm going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to start with OpenAI because it is the incumbent and is most feature-rich, but I'm going to show</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you others over time as well. So let's start with ChatGPT. What is this text box and what do we put</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">in here? Okay, so the most basic form of interaction with a language model is that we give</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">a text and then we get some text back in response. So as an example, we can ask to get a haiku about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">what it's like to be a large language model. So this is a good kind of example task for a language</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">model because these models are really good at writing. So writing haikus, or poems, or cover</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">letters, or resumes, or email replies, they're just good at writing. So when we ask for something like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">this, what happens looks as follows. The model basically responds, "Words flow like a stream,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">endless echoes nevermind, ghost of thought unseen." Okay, it's pretty dramatic. But what we're seeing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">here in ChatGPT is something that looks a bit like a conversation that you would have with a friend.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">These are kind of like chat bubbles. Now we saw in the previous video is that what's going on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">under the hood here is that this is what we call a user query, this piece of text. And this piece</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">of text and also the response from the model, this piece of text is chopped up into little text</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">chunks that we call tokens. So this sequence of text is under the hood, a token sequence,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">one-dimensional token sequence. Now the way we can see those tokens is we can use an app like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">for example, TickTokenizer. So making sure that GPT-40 is selected, I can paste my text here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is actually what the model sees under the hood. My piece of text to the model looks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">like a sequence of exactly 15 tokens. And these are the little text chunks that the model sees.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Now there's a vocabulary here of 200,000 roughly of possible tokens. And then these are the token</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">IDs corresponding to all these little text chunks that are part of my query. And you can play</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">with this and update it. And you can see that, for example, this is case sensitive. You would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">get different tokens. And you can kind of edit it and see live how the token sequence changes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So our query was 15 tokens. And then the model response is right here. And it responded back to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">us with a sequence of exactly 19 tokens. So that haiku is this sequence of 19 tokens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, so we said 15 tokens and it said 19 tokens back. Now, because this is a conversation and we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">want to actually maintain a lot of the metadata that actually makes up a conversation object,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">this is not all that's going on under the hood. And we saw in the previous video a little bit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">about the conversation format. So it gets a little bit more complicated in that we have to take our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">user query. And we have to actually use this chat format. So let me delete the system message. I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">don't think it's very important for the purposes of understanding what's going on. Let me paste my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">message as the user. And then let me paste the model response as an assistant. And then let me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">crop it here properly. The tool doesn't do that properly. So here we have it as it actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">happens under the hood. There are all these special tokens that basically begin a message</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">from the user. And then the user says, and this is the content of what we said. And then the user</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=355" target="_blank">00:05:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">ends. And then the assistant begins and says this, et cetera. Now, the precise details of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">conversation format are not important. What I want to get across here is that what looks to you and I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=367" target="_blank">00:06:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">as little chat bubbles going back and forth under the hood, we are collaborating with the model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=372" target="_blank">00:06:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and we're both writing into a token stream. And these two bubbles back and forth were in a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">sequence of exactly 42 tokens under the hood. I contributed some of the first tokens and then the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=386" target="_blank">00:06:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">model continued the sequence of tokens with its response. And we could alternate and continue</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=392" target="_blank">00:06:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">adding tokens here. And together we're building out a token window, a one-dimensional sequence</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=398" target="_blank">00:06:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">of tokens. Okay, so let's come back to chatGPT now. What we are seeing here is kind of like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">little bubbles going back and forth between us and the model. Under the hood, we are building</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=407" target="_blank">00:06:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">out a one-dimensional token sequence. When I click new chat here, that wipes the token window.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=414" target="_blank">00:06:54.720</a></span> | <span class="t">That resets the tokens to basically zero again and restarts the conversation from scratch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=420" target="_blank">00:07:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, the cartoon diagram that I have in my mind when I'm speaking to a model looks something like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=424" target="_blank">00:07:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">this. When we click new chat, we begin a token sequence. So this is a one-dimensional sequence</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=431" target="_blank">00:07:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">of tokens. The user, we can write tokens into this stream. And then when we hit enter, we transfer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=439" target="_blank">00:07:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">control over to the language model. And the language model responds with its own token streams.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=444" target="_blank">00:07:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the language model has a special token that basically says something along the lines of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=449" target="_blank">00:07:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">"I'm done." So when it emits that token, the chatGPT application transfers control back to us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=455" target="_blank">00:07:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">and we can take turns. Together, we are building out the token stream, which we also call the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=461" target="_blank">00:07:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">context window. So the context window is kind of like this working memory of tokens and anything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=468" target="_blank">00:07:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that is inside this context window is kind of like in the working memory of this conversation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=472" target="_blank">00:07:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and is very directly accessible by the model. Now, what is this entity here that we are talking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=479" target="_blank">00:07:59.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to and how should we think about it? Well, this language model here, we saw that the way it is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=484" target="_blank">00:08:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">trained in the previous video, we saw there are two major stages, the pre-training stage and the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=489" target="_blank">00:08:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">post-training stage. The pre-training stage is kind of like taking all of internet, chopping</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=496" target="_blank">00:08:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">it up into tokens, and then compressing it into a single kind of like zip file. But the zip file is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=502" target="_blank">00:08:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">not exact. The zip file is lossy and probabilistic zip file because we can't possibly represent all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=508" target="_blank">00:08:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">of internet than just one sort of like, say, terabyte of zip file because there's just way</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=515" target="_blank">00:08:35.920</a></span> | <span class="t">too much information. So we just kind of get the gestalt or the vibes inside this zip file.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=522" target="_blank">00:08:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, what's actually inside the zip file are the parameters of a neural network.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=528" target="_blank">00:08:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, for example, a one terabyte zip file would correspond to roughly, say, one trillion</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=534" target="_blank">00:08:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">parameters inside this neural network. And what this neural network is trying to do is it's trying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=540" target="_blank">00:09:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">to basically take tokens, and it's trying to predict the next token in a sequence. But it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=545" target="_blank">00:09:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">doing that on internet documents. So it's kind of like this internet document generator, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=550" target="_blank">00:09:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And in the process of predicting the next token in a sequence on internet,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=555" target="_blank">00:09:15.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the neural network gains a huge amount of knowledge about the world. And this knowledge</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=561" target="_blank">00:09:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">is all represented and stuffed and compressed inside the one trillion parameters, roughly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=566" target="_blank">00:09:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">of this language model. Now, this pre-training stage also we saw is fairly costly. So this can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=572" target="_blank">00:09:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">be many tens of millions of dollars, say like three months of training and so on. So this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=577" target="_blank">00:09:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">a costly long phase. For that reason, this phase is not done that often. So for example, GPT-4.0,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=585" target="_blank">00:09:45.520</a></span> | <span class="t">this model was pre-trained probably many months ago, maybe like even a year ago by now. And so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=592" target="_blank">00:09:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that's why these models are a little bit out of date. They have what's called a knowledge cutoff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=596" target="_blank">00:09:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Because that knowledge cutoff corresponds to when the model was pre-trained.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=600" target="_blank">00:10:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And its knowledge only goes up to that point. Now, some knowledge can come into the model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=609" target="_blank">00:10:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">through the post-training phase, which we'll talk about in a second. But roughly speaking,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=613" target="_blank">00:10:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">you should think of these models as kind of like a little bit out of date, because pre-training is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=617" target="_blank">00:10:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">way too expensive and happens infrequently. So any kind of recent information, like if you wanted to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=624" target="_blank">00:10:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">talk to your model about something that happened last week or so on, we're going to need other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=627" target="_blank">00:10:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">ways of providing that information to the model, because it's not stored in the knowledge of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=631" target="_blank">00:10:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">model. So we're going to have various tool use to give that information to the model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=636" target="_blank">00:10:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, after pre-training, there's the second stage called post-training. And the post-training stage</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=642" target="_blank">00:10:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">is really attaching a smiley face to this zip file. Because we don't want to generate internet</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=647" target="_blank">00:10:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">documents, we want this thing to take on the persona of an assistant that responds to user</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=653" target="_blank">00:10:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">queries. And that's done in the process of post-training, where we swap out the dataset</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=658" target="_blank">00:10:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">for a dataset of conversations that are built out by humans. So this is basically where the model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=664" target="_blank">00:11:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">takes on this persona, so that we can ask questions and it responds with answers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=669" target="_blank">00:11:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So it takes on the style of an assistant, that's post-training, but it has the knowledge</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=676" target="_blank">00:11:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">of all of internet, and that's by pre-training. So these two are combined in this artifact.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=683" target="_blank">00:11:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, the important thing to understand here, I think, for this section, is that what you are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=688" target="_blank">00:11:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">talking to is a fully self-contained entity by default. This language model, think of it as a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=694" target="_blank">00:11:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">one terabyte file on a disk. Secretly, that represents one trillion parameters and their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=700" target="_blank">00:11:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">precise settings inside the neural network that's trying to give you the next token in a sequence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=705" target="_blank">00:11:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But this is the fully self-contained entity. There's no calculator, there's no computer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=710" target="_blank">00:11:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and Python interpreter, there's no worldwide web browsing, there's none of that. There's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=714" target="_blank">00:11:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">no tool use yet in what we've talked about so far. You're talking to a zip file. If you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=719" target="_blank">00:11:59.120</a></span> | <span class="t">stream tokens to it, it will respond with tokens back. And the zip file has the knowledge from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=725" target="_blank">00:12:05.040</a></span> | <span class="t">pre-training and it has the style and form from post-training. And so that's roughly how you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=732" target="_blank">00:12:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">think about this entity. Okay, so if I had to summarize what we talked about so far, I would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=737" target="_blank">00:12:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">probably do it in the form of an introduction of ChatGPT in a way that I think you should think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=741" target="_blank">00:12:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">about it. So the introduction would be, "Hi, I'm ChatGPT. I'm a one terabyte zip file. My knowledge</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=747" target="_blank">00:12:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">comes from the internet, which I read in its entirety about six months ago and I only remember</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=754" target="_blank">00:12:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">vaguely. Okay? And my winning personality was programmed, by example, by human labelers at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=759" target="_blank">00:12:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">OpenAI." So the personality is programmed in post-training and the knowledge comes from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=766" target="_blank">00:12:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">compressing the internet during pre-training. And this knowledge is a little bit out of date</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=771" target="_blank">00:12:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and it's probabilistic and slightly vague. Some of the things that probably are mentioned very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=776" target="_blank">00:12:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">frequently on the internet, I will have a lot better recollection of than some of the things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=781" target="_blank">00:13:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">that are discussed very rarely, very similar to what you might expect with a human. So let's now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=786" target="_blank">00:13:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">talk about some of the repercussions of this entity and how we can talk to it and what kinds</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=791" target="_blank">00:13:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">of things we can expect from it. Now I'd like to use real examples when we actually go through this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=795" target="_blank">00:13:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So for example, this morning I asked ChatGPT the following, "How much caffeine is in one shot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=799" target="_blank">00:13:19.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Americana?" And I was curious because I was comparing it to matcha. Now ChatGPT will tell</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=804" target="_blank">00:13:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">me that this is roughly 63 milligrams of caffeine or so. Now the reason I'm asking ChatGPT this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=809" target="_blank">00:13:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">question that I think this is okay is, number one, I'm not asking about any knowledge that is very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=815" target="_blank">00:13:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">recent. So I do expect that the model has sort of read about how much caffeine there is in one shot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=820" target="_blank">00:13:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think this information has changed too much. And number two, I think this information</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=824" target="_blank">00:13:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">is extremely frequent on the internet. This kind of a question and this kind of information has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=828" target="_blank">00:13:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">occurred all over the place on the internet. And because there were so many mentions of it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=833" target="_blank">00:13:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I expect the model to have good memory of it and its knowledge. So there's no tool use and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=838" target="_blank">00:13:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the model, the zip file, responded that there's roughly 63 milligrams. Now I'm not guaranteed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=843" target="_blank">00:14:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">that this is the correct answer. This is just its vague recollection of the internet. But I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=850" target="_blank">00:14:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">can go to primary sources and maybe I can look up, okay, caffeine and Americano and I could verify</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=856" target="_blank">00:14:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">that, yeah, it looks to be about 63 is roughly right. And you can look at primary sources to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=860" target="_blank">00:14:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">decide if this is true or not. So I'm not strictly speaking guaranteed that this is true, but I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=865" target="_blank">00:14:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">probably this is the kind of thing that ChatGPT would know. Here's an example of a conversation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=869" target="_blank">00:14:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I had two days ago, actually. And there's another example of a knowledge-based conversation and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=874" target="_blank">00:14:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">things that I'm comfortable asking of ChatGPT with some caveats. So I'm a bit sick, I have runny nose</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=879" target="_blank">00:14:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and I want to get meds that help with that. So it told me a bunch of stuff. And I want my nose to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=887" target="_blank">00:14:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">not be runny. So I gave it a clarification based on what it said. And then it kind of gave me some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=892" target="_blank">00:14:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">of the things that might be helpful with that. And then I looked at some of the meds that I have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=896" target="_blank">00:14:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">at home. And I said, does DayQuil or NightQuil work? And it went off and it kind of like went</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=901" target="_blank">00:15:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">over the ingredients of DayQuil and NightQuil and whether or not they help mitigate runny nose.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=907" target="_blank">00:15:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, when these ingredients are coming here, again, remember, we are talking to a zip file</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=912" target="_blank">00:15:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that has a recollection of the internet. I'm not guaranteed that these ingredients are correct.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=916" target="_blank">00:15:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And in fact, I actually took out the box and I looked at the ingredients and I made sure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=920" target="_blank">00:15:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">that NightQuil ingredients are exactly these ingredients. And I'm doing that because I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=926" target="_blank">00:15:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">always fully trust what's coming out here, right? This is just a probabilistic statistical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=930" target="_blank">00:15:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">recollection of the internet. But that said, conversations of DayQuil and NightQuil, these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=935" target="_blank">00:15:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">are very common meds. Probably there's tons of information about a lot of this on the internet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=940" target="_blank">00:15:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is the kind of things that the model have pretty good recollection of. So actually,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=945" target="_blank">00:15:45.600</a></span> | <span class="t">these were all correct. And then I said, okay, well, I have NightQuil. How fast would it act</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=951" target="_blank">00:15:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">roughly? And it kind of tells me. And then is acetaminophen basically a Tylenol? And it says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=956" target="_blank">00:15:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">yes. So this is a good example of how ChachAPT was useful to me. It is a knowledge-based query.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=962" target="_blank">00:16:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This knowledge sort of isn't recent knowledge. This is all coming from the knowledge of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=966" target="_blank">00:16:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">model. I think this is common information. This is not a high-stakes situation. I'm checking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=971" target="_blank">00:16:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">ChachAPT a little bit. But also, this is not a high-stakes situation, so no big deal. So I popped</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=976" target="_blank">00:16:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">a NightQuil and indeed it helped. But that's roughly how I'm thinking about what's coming</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=981" target="_blank">00:16:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">back here. Okay, so at this point, I want to make two notes. The first note I want to make is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=986" target="_blank">00:16:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">naturally as you interact with these models, you'll see that your conversations are growing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=991" target="_blank">00:16:31.040</a></span> | <span class="t">longer, right? Anytime you are switching topic, I encourage you to always start a new chat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=997" target="_blank">00:16:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">When you start a new chat, as we talked about, you are wiping the context window of tokens</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1002" target="_blank">00:16:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and resetting it back to zero. If it is the case that those tokens are not anymore useful to your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1007" target="_blank">00:16:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">next query, I encourage you to do this because these tokens in this window are expensive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1012" target="_blank">00:16:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And they're expensive in kind of like two ways. Number one, if you have lots of tokens here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1018" target="_blank">00:16:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">then the model can actually find it a little bit distracting. So if this was a lot of tokens,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1024" target="_blank">00:17:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">this is kind of like the working memory of the model. The model might be distracted by all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1029" target="_blank">00:17:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">tokens in the past when it is trying to sample tokens much later on. So it could be distracting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1035" target="_blank">00:17:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and it could actually decrease the accuracy of the model and of its performance. And number two,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1040" target="_blank">00:17:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the more tokens are in the window, the more expensive it is by a little bit, not by too much,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1045" target="_blank">00:17:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">but by a little bit to sample the next token in the sequence. So your model is actually slightly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1050" target="_blank">00:17:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">slowing down. It's becoming more expensive to calculate the next token and the more tokens</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1055" target="_blank">00:17:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">there are here. And so think of the tokens in the context window as a precious resource.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1061" target="_blank">00:17:41.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Think of that as the working memory of the model and don't overload it with irrelevant information</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1067" target="_blank">00:17:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and keep it as short as you can. And you can expect that to work faster and slightly better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1073" target="_blank">00:17:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Of course, if the information actually is related to your task, you may want to keep it in there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1077" target="_blank">00:17:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But I encourage you to, as often as you can, basically start a new chat whenever you are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1082" target="_blank">00:18:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">switching topic. The second thing is that I always encourage you to keep in mind what model you are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1087" target="_blank">00:18:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">actually using. So here on the top left, we can drop down and we can see that we are currently</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1091" target="_blank">00:18:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">using GPT 4.0. Now, there are many different models of many different flavors, and there are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1097" target="_blank">00:18:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">too many actually, but we'll go through some of these over time. So we are using GPT 4.0 right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1102" target="_blank">00:18:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">now. And in everything that I've shown you, this is GPT 4.0. Now, when I open a new incognito</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1107" target="_blank">00:18:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">window, so if I go to chatgpt.com and I'm not logged in, the model that I'm talking to here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1113" target="_blank">00:18:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">so if I just say hello, the model that I'm talking to here might not be GPT 4.0. It might be a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1118" target="_blank">00:18:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">smaller version. Now, unfortunately, OpenAI does not tell me when I'm not logged in what model I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1123" target="_blank">00:18:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">using, which is kind of unfortunate. But it's possible that you are using a smaller, kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1128" target="_blank">00:18:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">dumber model. So if we go to the chatgpt pricing page here, we see that they have three basic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1134" target="_blank">00:18:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">tiers for individuals, the free, plus, and pro. And in the free tier, you have access to what's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1141" target="_blank">00:19:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">called GPT 4.0 mini. And this is a smaller version of GPT 4.0. It is a smaller model with a smaller</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1148" target="_blank">00:19:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">number of parameters. It's not going to be as creative, like its writing might not be as good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1152" target="_blank">00:19:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Its knowledge is not going to be as good. It's going to probably hallucinate a bit more, etc.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1156" target="_blank">00:19:16.640</a></span> | <span class="t">But it is kind of like the free offering, the free tier. They do say that you have limited access to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1161" target="_blank">00:19:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">4.0 and 3.0 mini, but I'm not actually 100% sure. Like, it didn't tell us which model we were using,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1166" target="_blank">00:19:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">so we just fundamentally don't know. Now, when you pay for $20 per month, even though it doesn't say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1172" target="_blank">00:19:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">this, I think basically, like, they're screwing up on how they're describing this. But if you go to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1177" target="_blank">00:19:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">fine print, limit supply, we can see that the plus users get 80 messages every three hours for GPT 4.0.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1186" target="_blank">00:19:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's the flagship biggest model that's currently available as of today. That's available</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1192" target="_blank">00:19:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and that's what we want to be using. So if you pay $20 per month, you have that with some limits.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1196" target="_blank">00:19:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And then if you pay for $200 per month, you get the pro, and there's a bunch of additional goodies</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1201" target="_blank">00:20:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">as well as unlimited GPT 4.0. And we're going to go into some of this because I do pay for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1206" target="_blank">00:20:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">pro subscription. Now, the whole takeaway I want you to get from this is be mindful of the models</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1212" target="_blank">00:20:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">that you're using. Typically, with these companies, the bigger models are more expensive to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1216" target="_blank">00:20:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">calculate. And so therefore, the companies charge more for the bigger models. And so make those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1223" target="_blank">00:20:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">trade-offs for yourself, depending on your usage of LLMs. Have a look at if you can get away with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1229" target="_blank">00:20:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the cheaper offerings. And if the intelligence is not good enough for you and you're using this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1232" target="_blank">00:20:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">professionally, you may really want to consider paying for the top tier models that are available</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1236" target="_blank">00:20:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">from these companies. In my case, in my professional work, I do a lot of coding and a lot of things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1240" target="_blank">00:20:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">like that. And this is still very cheap for me. So I pay this very gladly because I get access to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1246" target="_blank">00:20:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">some really powerful models that I'll show you in a bit. So yeah, keep track of what model you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1251" target="_blank">00:20:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">using and make those decisions for yourself. I also want to show you that all the other LLM</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1256" target="_blank">00:20:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">providers will all have different pricing tiers with different models at different tiers that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1261" target="_blank">00:21:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">you can pay for. So for example, if we go to Claude from Anthropic, you'll see that I am</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1266" target="_blank">00:21:06.240</a></span> | <span class="t">paying for the professional plan and that gives me access to Claude 3.5 Sonnet. And if you are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1271" target="_blank">00:21:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">not paying for a pro plan, then probably you only have access to maybe Haiku or something like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1275" target="_blank">00:21:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And so use the most powerful model that kind of like works for you. Here's an example of me using</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1282" target="_blank">00:21:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Claude a while back. I was asking for just travel advice. So I was asking for a cool city to go to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1288" target="_blank">00:21:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and Claude told me that Zermatt in Switzerland is really cool. So I ended up going there for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1293" target="_blank">00:21:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">a New Year's break following Claude's advice. But this is just an example of another thing that I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1297" target="_blank">00:21:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">find these models pretty useful for is travel advice and ideation and getting pointers that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1302" target="_blank">00:21:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">you can research further. Here we also have an example of Gemini.google.com. So this is from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1309" target="_blank">00:21:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Google. I got Gemini's opinion on the matter and I asked it for a cool city to go to, and it also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1314" target="_blank">00:21:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">recommended Zermatt. So that was nice. So I like to go between different models and asking them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1320" target="_blank">00:22:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">similar questions and seeing what they think about. And for Gemini also on the top left,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1324" target="_blank">00:22:04.640</a></span> | <span class="t">we also have a model selector. So you can pay for the more advanced tiers and use those models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1330" target="_blank">00:22:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Same thing goes for Grok, just released. We don't want to be asking Grok 2 questions because we know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1336" target="_blank">00:22:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that Grok 3 is the most advanced model. So I want to make sure that I pay enough and such that I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1342" target="_blank">00:22:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">have Grok 3 access. So for all these different providers, find the one that works best for you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1348" target="_blank">00:22:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">experiment with different providers, experiment with different pricing tiers for the problems</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1351" target="_blank">00:22:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">that you are working on. And that's kind of, and often I end up personally just paying for a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1357" target="_blank">00:22:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">of them and then asking all of them the same question. And I kind of refer to all these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1362" target="_blank">00:22:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">models as my LLM council. So they're kind of like the council of language models. If I'm trying to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1367" target="_blank">00:22:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">figure out where to go on a vacation, I will ask all of them. And so you can also do that for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1372" target="_blank">00:22:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">yourself if that works for you. Okay, the next topic I want to now turn to is that of thinking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1377" target="_blank">00:22:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">models, quote unquote. So we saw in the previous video that there are multiple stages of training.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1382" target="_blank">00:23:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Pre-training goes to supervised fine-tuning, goes to reinforcement learning. And reinforcement</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1388" target="_blank">00:23:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">learning is where the model gets to practice on a large collection of problems that resemble</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1393" target="_blank">00:23:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the practice problems in the textbook. And it gets to practice on a lot of math and code problems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1399" target="_blank">00:23:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And in the process of reinforcement learning, the model discovers thinking strategies that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1406" target="_blank">00:23:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">lead to good outcomes. And these thinking strategies, when you look at them,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1410" target="_blank">00:23:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">they very much resemble kind of the inner monologue you have when you go through problem solving.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1414" target="_blank">00:23:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So the model will try out different ideas, it will backtrack, it will revisit assumptions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1420" target="_blank">00:23:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and it will do things like that. Now, a lot of these strategies are very difficult to hard code</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1424" target="_blank">00:23:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">as a human labeler, because it's not clear what the thinking process should be. It's only in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1428" target="_blank">00:23:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">reinforcement learning that the model can try out lots of stuff. And it can find the thinking process</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1433" target="_blank">00:23:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">that works for it with its knowledge and its capabilities. So this is the third stage of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1439" target="_blank">00:23:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">training these models. This stage is relatively recent, so only a year or two ago. And all of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1446" target="_blank">00:24:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">different LLM labs have been experimenting with these models over the last year. And this is kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1450" target="_blank">00:24:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">of like seen as a large breakthrough recently. And here we looked at the paper from DeepSeek</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1457" target="_blank">00:24:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">that was the first to basically talk about it publicly. And they had a nice paper about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1462" target="_blank">00:24:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">incentivizing reasoning capabilities in LLMs via reinforcement learning. So that's the paper that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1466" target="_blank">00:24:26.720</a></span> | <span class="t">we looked at in the previous video. So we now have to adjust our cartoon a little bit, because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1470" target="_blank">00:24:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">basically what it looks like is our emoji now has this optional thinking bubble. And when you are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1478" target="_blank">00:24:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">using a thinking model, which will do additional thinking, you are using the model that has been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1483" target="_blank">00:24:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">additionally tuned with reinforcement learning. And qualitatively, what does this look like?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1489" target="_blank">00:24:49.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, qualitatively, the model will do a lot more thinking. And what you can expect is that you will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1494" target="_blank">00:24:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">get higher accuracies, especially on problems that are, for example, math, code, and things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1498" target="_blank">00:24:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">that require a lot of thinking. Things that are very simple might not actually benefit from this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1504" target="_blank">00:25:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">but things that are actually deep and hard might benefit a lot. And so, but basically what you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1511" target="_blank">00:25:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">paying for it is that the models will do thinking, and that can sometimes take multiple minutes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1516" target="_blank">00:25:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">because the models will emit tons and tons of tokens over a period of many minutes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1520" target="_blank">00:25:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and you have to wait, because the model is thinking just like a human would think.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1523" target="_blank">00:25:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">But in situations where you have very difficult problems, this might translate to higher accuracy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1529" target="_blank">00:25:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's take a look at some examples. So here's a concrete example when I was stuck on a programming</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1534" target="_blank">00:25:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">problem recently. So something called the gradient check fails, and I'm not sure why,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1538" target="_blank">00:25:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and I copy pasted the model, my code. So the details of the code are not important,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1544" target="_blank">00:25:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">but this is basically an optimization of a multi-layer perceptron, and details are not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1550" target="_blank">00:25:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">important. It's a bunch of code that I wrote, and there was a bug because my gradient check</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1553" target="_blank">00:25:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">didn't work, and I was just asking for advice. And GPT-4.0, which is the flagship, most powerful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1559" target="_blank">00:25:59.200</a></span> | <span class="t">model for open AI, but without thinking, just kind of like went into a bunch of things that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1565" target="_blank">00:26:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">it thought were issues or that I should double check, but actually didn't really solve the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1569" target="_blank">00:26:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">problem. Like all the things that it gave me here are not the core issue of the problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1575" target="_blank">00:26:15.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So the model didn't really solve the issue, and it tells me about how to debug it and so on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1580" target="_blank">00:26:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But then what I did was, here in the dropdown, I turned to one of the thinking models. Now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1586" target="_blank">00:26:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">for open AI, all of these models that start with O are thinking models. O1, O3 mini, O3 mini high,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1595" target="_blank">00:26:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and O1 pro, pro mode, are all thinking models. And they're not very good at naming their models,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1601" target="_blank">00:26:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">but that is the case. And so here they will say something like, "Uses advanced reasoning," or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1607" target="_blank">00:26:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">"Good at coding logics," and stuff like that. But these are basically all tuned with reinforcement</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1613" target="_blank">00:26:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">learning. And because I am paying for $200 per month, I have access to O1 pro mode,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1619" target="_blank">00:26:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">which is best at reasoning. But you might want to try some of the other ones depending on your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1626" target="_blank">00:27:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">pricing tier. And when I gave the same model, the same prompt to O1 pro, which is the best</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1633" target="_blank">00:27:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">at reasoning model, and you have to pay $200 per month for this one,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1637" target="_blank">00:27:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">then the exact same prompt, it went off and it thought for one minute. And it went through a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1643" target="_blank">00:27:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">sequence of thoughts, and open AI doesn't fully show you the exact thoughts. They just kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1648" target="_blank">00:27:28.560</a></span> | <span class="t">give you a little summaries of the thoughts. But it thought about the code for a while,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1653" target="_blank">00:27:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and then it actually came back with the correct solution. It noticed that the parameters are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1657" target="_blank">00:27:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">mismatched in how I pack and unpack them, and et cetera. So this actually solved my problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1661" target="_blank">00:27:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And I tried out giving the exact same prompt to a bunch of other LLMs. So for example, Claude,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1668" target="_blank">00:27:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I gave Claude the same problem, and it actually noticed the correct issue and solved it. And it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1675" target="_blank">00:27:55.520</a></span> | <span class="t">did that even with Sonnet, which is not a thinking model. So Claude 3.5 Sonnet, to my knowledge,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1682" target="_blank">00:28:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">is not a thinking model. And to my knowledge, Anthropic, as of today, doesn't have a thinking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1687" target="_blank">00:28:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">model deployed, but this might change by the time you watch this video. But even without thinking,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1693" target="_blank">00:28:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">this model actually solved the issue. When I went to Gemini, I asked it, and it also solved the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1700" target="_blank">00:28:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">issue, even though I also could have tried the thinking model, but it wasn't necessary.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1704" target="_blank">00:28:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I also gave it to Grok, Grok 3 in this case, and Grok 3 also solved the problem after a bunch of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1710" target="_blank">00:28:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">stuff. So it also solved the issue. And then finally, I went to Perplexity.ai. And the reason</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1719" target="_blank">00:28:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I like Perplexity is because when you go to the model dropdown, one of the models that they host</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1723" target="_blank">00:28:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">is this DeepSeq R1. So this has the reasoning with the DeepSeq R1 model, which is the model that we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1730" target="_blank">00:28:50.560</a></span> | <span class="t">saw over here. This is the paper. So Perplexity just hosts it and makes it very easy to use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1738" target="_blank">00:28:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So I copy pasted it there and I ran it. And I think they render, they like really render it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1744" target="_blank">00:29:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">terribly. But down here, you can see the raw thoughts of the model, even though you have to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1752" target="_blank">00:29:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">expand them. But you see like, okay, the user is having trouble with the gradient check, and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1757" target="_blank">00:29:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">it tries out a bunch of stuff. And then it says, but wait, when they accumulate the gradients,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1761" target="_blank">00:29:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">they're doing the thing incorrectly. Let's check the order. The parameters are packed as this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1766" target="_blank">00:29:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and then it notices the issue. And then it kind of like says, that's a critical mistake.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1771" target="_blank">00:29:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it kind of like thinks through it and you have to wait a few minutes and then also comes up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1775" target="_blank">00:29:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">with the correct answer. So basically, long story short, what do I want to show you?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1780" target="_blank">00:29:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">There exists a class of models that we call thinking models. All the different providers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1784" target="_blank">00:29:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">may or may not have a thinking model. These models are most effective for difficult problems in math</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1790" target="_blank">00:29:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and code and things like that. And in those kinds of cases, they can push up the accuracy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1795" target="_blank">00:29:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">of your performance. In many cases, like if you're asking for travel advice or something like that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1800" target="_blank">00:30:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you're not going to benefit out of a thinking model. There's no need to wait for one minute</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1804" target="_blank">00:30:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">for it to think about some destinations that you might want to go to. So for myself, I usually try</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1810" target="_blank">00:30:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">out the non-thinking models because their responses are really fast. But when I suspect the response</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1815" target="_blank">00:30:15.040</a></span> | <span class="t">is not as good as it could have been, and I want to give the opportunity to the model to think a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1819" target="_blank">00:30:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">bit longer about it, I will change it to a thinking model, depending on whichever one you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1824" target="_blank">00:30:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">available to you. Now, when you go to Grok, for example, and when I start a new conversation with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1830" target="_blank">00:30:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Grok, when you put the question here, like, "Hello," you should put something important here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1837" target="_blank">00:30:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">you see here, "Think." So let the model take its time. So turn on "Think," and then click "Go."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1843" target="_blank">00:30:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And when you click "Think," Grok, under the hood, switches to the thinking model. And all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1849" target="_blank">00:30:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">different OLLM providers will kind of like have some kind of a selector for whether or not you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1852" target="_blank">00:30:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">want the model to think, or whether it's okay to just like go with the previous kind of generation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1859" target="_blank">00:30:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">of the models. Okay, now the next section I want to continue to is to tool use. So far, we've only</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1866" target="_blank">00:31:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">talked to the language model through text. And this language model is, again, this zip file in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1872" target="_blank">00:31:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">a folder, it's inert, it's closed off, it's got no tools, it's just a neural network that can emit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1878" target="_blank">00:31:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">tokens. So what we want to do now, though, is we want to go beyond that. And we want to give the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1882" target="_blank">00:31:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">model the ability to use a bunch of tools. And one of the most useful tools is an internet search.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1888" target="_blank">00:31:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so let's take a look at how we can make models use internet search. So for example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1894" target="_blank">00:31:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">again, using concrete examples from my own life, a few days ago, I was watching White Lotus season</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1900" target="_blank">00:31:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">three. And I watched the first episode. And I love this TV show, by the way. And I was curious when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1905" target="_blank">00:31:45.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the episode two was coming out. And so in the old world, you would imagine you go to Google or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1911" target="_blank">00:31:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">something like that, you put in like new episodes of White Lotus season three, and then you start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1916" target="_blank">00:31:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">clicking on these links. And maybe open a few of them. Or something like that, right? And you start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1922" target="_blank">00:32:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">like searching through it and trying to figure it out. And sometimes you luck out and you get a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1927" target="_blank">00:32:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">schedule. But many times you might get really crazy ads, there's a bunch of random stuff going on,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1933" target="_blank">00:32:13.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and it's just kind of like an unpleasant experience, right? So wouldn't it be great if a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1937" target="_blank">00:32:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">model could do this kind of a search for you, visit all the webpages, and then take all those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1943" target="_blank">00:32:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">webpages, take all their content and stuff it into the context window, and then basically give you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1951" target="_blank">00:32:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the response. And that's what we're going to do now. Basically, we have a mechanism or a way,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1957" target="_blank">00:32:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">we introduce a mechanism for the model to emit a special token that is some kind of a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1963" target="_blank">00:32:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">search the internet token. And when the model emits the search the internet token,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1968" target="_blank">00:32:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the chat GPT application, or whatever LLM application it is you're using, will stop</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1974" target="_blank">00:32:54.720</a></span> | <span class="t">sampling from the model. And it will take the query that the model gave, it goes off, it does</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1979" target="_blank">00:32:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">a search, it visits webpages, it takes all of their text, and it puts everything into the context</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1985" target="_blank">00:33:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">window. So now you have this internet search tool that itself can also contribute tokens into our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1992" target="_blank">00:33:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">context window. And in this case, it would be like lots of internet webpages, and maybe there's 10</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=1997" target="_blank">00:33:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">of them, and maybe it just puts it all together. And this could be thousands of tokens coming from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2001" target="_blank">00:33:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">these webpages, just as we were looking at them ourselves. And then after it has inserted all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2006" target="_blank">00:33:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">those webpages into the context window, it will reference back to your question as to, hey, when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2012" target="_blank">00:33:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">is this season getting released? And it will be able to reference the text and give you the correct</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2017" target="_blank">00:33:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">answer. And notice that this is a really good example of why we would need internet search.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2022" target="_blank">00:33:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Without the internet search, this model has no chance to actually give us the correct answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2027" target="_blank">00:33:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Because like I mentioned, this model was trained a few months ago, the schedule probably was not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2031" target="_blank">00:33:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">known back then. And so when White Lotus Season 3 is coming out is not part of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2036" target="_blank">00:33:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">real knowledge of the model. And it's not in the zip file, most likely, because this is something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2043" target="_blank">00:34:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">that was presumably decided on in the last few weeks. And so the model has to basically go off</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2047" target="_blank">00:34:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and do internet search to learn this knowledge. And it learns it from the webpages, just like you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2051" target="_blank">00:34:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and I would without it. And then it can answer the question once that information is in the context</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2056" target="_blank">00:34:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">window. And remember, again, that the context window is this working memory. So once we load</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2062" target="_blank">00:34:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the articles, once all of these articles think of their text as being copy pasted into the context</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2070" target="_blank">00:34:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">window, now they're in a working memory, and the model can actually answer those questions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2075" target="_blank">00:34:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">because it's in the context window. So basically, long story short, don't do this manually,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2081" target="_blank">00:34:41.280</a></span> | <span class="t">but use tools like Perplexity as an example. So Perplexity.ai had a really nice sort of LLM that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2088" target="_blank">00:34:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">was doing internet search. And I think it was like the first app that really convincingly did this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2093" target="_blank">00:34:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">More recently, Chachibti also introduced a search button. It says search the web. So we're going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2099" target="_blank">00:34:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">take a look at that in a second. For now, when are new episodes of White Lotus Season 3 getting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2104" target="_blank">00:35:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">released? You can just ask. And instead of having to do the work manually, we just hit enter,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2108" target="_blank">00:35:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and the model will visit these web pages, it will create all the queries, and then it will give you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2112" target="_blank">00:35:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">the answer. So it just kind of did a ton of the work for you. And then you can, usually there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2119" target="_blank">00:35:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">will be citations, so you can actually visit those web pages yourself, and you can make sure these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2124" target="_blank">00:35:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">are not hallucinations from the model, and you can actually double check that this is actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2128" target="_blank">00:35:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">correct. Because it's not in principle guaranteed, it's just something that may or may not work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2136" target="_blank">00:35:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">If we take this, we can also go to, for example, Chachibti, say the same thing. But now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2140" target="_blank">00:35:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">when we put this question in, without actually selecting search, I'm not actually 100% sure what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2145" target="_blank">00:35:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the model will do. In some cases, the model will actually know that this is recent knowledge,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2151" target="_blank">00:35:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and that it probably doesn't know, and it will create a search. In some cases, we have to declare</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2155" target="_blank">00:35:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">that we want to do the search. In my own personal use, I would know that the model doesn't know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2160" target="_blank">00:36:00.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and so I would just select search. But let's see first, let's see if what happens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2164" target="_blank">00:36:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, searching the web, and then it prints stuff, and then it cites. So the model actually detected</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2172" target="_blank">00:36:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">itself that it needs to search the web, because it understands that this is some kind of a recent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2176" target="_blank">00:36:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">information, etc. So this was correct. Alternatively, if I create a new conversation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2180" target="_blank">00:36:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I could have also selected search, because I know I need to search. Enter. And then it does the same</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2186" target="_blank">00:36:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">thing, searching the web, and that's the result. So basically, when you're using these LLM,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2191" target="_blank">00:36:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">look for this. For example, Grok. Excuse me. Let's try Grok. Without it, without selecting search.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2203" target="_blank">00:36:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so the model does some search, just knowing that it needs to search,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2206" target="_blank">00:36:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and gives you the answer. So basically, let's see what Claude does.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2212" target="_blank">00:36:52.720</a></span> | <span class="t">You see, so Claude doesn't actually have the search tool available. So we'll say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2220" target="_blank">00:37:00.160</a></span> | <span class="t">as of my last update in April 2024, this last update is when the model went through pre-training.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2226" target="_blank">00:37:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And so Claude is just saying, as of my last update, the knowledge cutoff of April 2024,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2232" target="_blank">00:37:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">it was announced, but it doesn't know. So Claude doesn't have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2237" target="_blank">00:37:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the internet search integrated as an option, and will not give you the answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2242" target="_blank">00:37:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I expect that this is something that Anthropic might be working on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2244" target="_blank">00:37:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's try Gemini, and let's see what it says. Unfortunately, no official release date for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2251" target="_blank">00:37:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">White Lotus Season 3 yet. So Gemini 2.0 Pro Experimental does not have access to internet</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2260" target="_blank">00:37:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">search, and doesn't know. We could try some of the other ones, like 2.0 Flash. Let me try that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2270" target="_blank">00:37:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so this model seems to know, but it doesn't give citations. Oh wait, okay, there we go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2275" target="_blank">00:37:55.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Sources and related content. So you see how 2.0 Flash actually has the internet search tool,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2282" target="_blank">00:38:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">but I'm guessing that the 2.0 Pro, which is the most powerful model that they have,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2289" target="_blank">00:38:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">this one actually does not have access. And in here, it actually tells us,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2293" target="_blank">00:38:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">2.0 Pro Experimental lacks access to real-time info and some Gemini features.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2297" target="_blank">00:38:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So this model is not fully wired with internet search. So long story short, we can get models</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2304" target="_blank">00:38:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to perform Google searches for us, visit the webpages, pull in the information to the context</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2309" target="_blank">00:38:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">window, and answer questions. And this is a very, very cool feature. But different models,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2315" target="_blank">00:38:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">possibly different apps, have different amount of integration of this capability,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2321" target="_blank">00:38:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and so you have to be kind of on the lookout for that. And sometimes the model will automatically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2324" target="_blank">00:38:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">detect that they need to do search, and sometimes you're better off telling the model that you want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2329" target="_blank">00:38:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">it to do the search. So when I'm doing GPT 4.0 and I know that this requires a search,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2335" target="_blank">00:38:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">you probably want to tick that box. So that's search tools. I wanted to show you a few more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2342" target="_blank">00:39:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">examples of how I use the search tool in my own work. So what are the kinds of queries that I use?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2348" target="_blank">00:39:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is fairly easy for me to do because usually for these kinds of cases, I go to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2352" target="_blank">00:39:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Perplexity just out of habit, even though ChatGPT today can do this kind of stuff as well, as do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2358" target="_blank">00:39:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">probably many other services as well. But I happen to use Perplexity for these kinds of search queries.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2364" target="_blank">00:39:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So whenever I expect that the answer can be achieved by doing basically something like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2369" target="_blank">00:39:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Google search and visiting a few of the top links, and the answer is somewhere in those top links,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2374" target="_blank">00:39:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">whenever that is the case, I expect to use the search tool, and I come to Perplexity. So here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2379" target="_blank">00:39:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">are some examples. Is the market open today? And this was on precedence day, I wasn't 100% sure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2386" target="_blank">00:39:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So Perplexity understands what is today, it will do the search and it will figure out that on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2391" target="_blank">00:39:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">precedence day this was closed. Where's White Lotus season three filmed? Again, this is something that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2397" target="_blank">00:39:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I wasn't sure that a model would know in its knowledge. This is something niche, so maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2401" target="_blank">00:40:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">there's not that many mentions of it on the internet. And also this is more recent, so I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2406" target="_blank">00:40:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">don't expect a model to know by default. So this was a good fit for the search tool. Does Vercel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2415" target="_blank">00:40:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">offer PostgreSQL database? So this was a good example of this, because this kind of stuff</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2422" target="_blank">00:40:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">changes over time, and the offerings of Vercel, which is a company, may change over time, and I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2429" target="_blank">00:40:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">want the latest. And whenever something is latest or something changes, I prefer to use the search</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2434" target="_blank">00:40:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">tool, so I come to Perplexity. What is the Apple launch tomorrow, and what are some of the rumors?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2440" target="_blank">00:40:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, this is something recent. Where is the Singles Inferno season four cast? Must know. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2448" target="_blank">00:40:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">this is, again, a good example, because this is very fresh information. Why is the Palantir stock</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2454" target="_blank">00:40:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">going up? What is driving the enthusiasm? When is Civilization VII coming out exactly?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2462" target="_blank">00:41:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">This is an example also. Has Brian Johnson talked about the toothpaste he uses?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2466" target="_blank">00:41:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was curious, basically, about what Brian does. And again, it has the two features. Number</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2471" target="_blank">00:41:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">one, it's a little bit esoteric, so I'm not 100% sure if this is at scale on the internet and would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2476" target="_blank">00:41:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">be part of knowledge of a model. And number two, this might change over time, so I want to know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2481" target="_blank">00:41:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">what toothpaste he uses most recently. And so this is a good fit, again, for a search tool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2485" target="_blank">00:41:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Is it safe to travel to Vietnam? This can potentially change over time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2490" target="_blank">00:41:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I saw a bunch of stuff on Twitter about a USAID, and I wanted to know what's the deal,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2495" target="_blank">00:41:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">so I searched about that. And then you can dive in a bunch of ways here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2500" target="_blank">00:41:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But this use case here is along the lines of, "I see something trending, and I'm curious what's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2506" target="_blank">00:41:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">happening. What is the gist of it?" And so I very often just quickly bring up a search of what's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2511" target="_blank">00:41:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">happening, and then get a model to just give me a gist of roughly what happened. Because a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2516" target="_blank">00:41:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the individual tweets or posts might not have the full context just by itself. So these are examples</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2522" target="_blank">00:42:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">of how I use a search tool. Okay, next up, I would like to tell you about this capability called Deep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2527" target="_blank">00:42:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Research. And this is fairly recent, only as of like a month or two ago. But I think it's incredibly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2532" target="_blank">00:42:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">cool and really interesting, and kind of went under the radar for a lot of people, even though</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2536" target="_blank">00:42:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it shouldn't have. So when we go to Chachapiti Pricing here, we notice that Deep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2541" target="_blank">00:42:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Research is listed here under Pro. So it currently requires $200 per month. So this is the top tier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2547" target="_blank">00:42:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">However, I think it's incredibly cool. So let me show you by example in what kinds of scenarios</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2553" target="_blank">00:42:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">you might want to use it. Roughly speaking, Deep Research is a combination of internet search and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2560" target="_blank">00:42:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">thinking, and rolled out for a long time. So the model will go off, and it will spend tens of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2566" target="_blank">00:42:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">minutes doing with Deep Research. And the first sort of company that announced this was Chachapiti</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2573" target="_blank">00:42:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">as part of its pro offering very recently, like a month ago. So here's an example. Recently,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2580" target="_blank">00:43:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I was on the internet buying supplements, which I know is kind of crazy. But Brian Johnson has this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2585" target="_blank">00:43:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">starter pack, and I was kind of curious about it. And there's the thing called longevity mix, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2589" target="_blank">00:43:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's got a bunch of health actives. And I want to know what these things are, right? And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2595" target="_blank">00:43:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">of course, so like CAKG, like what the hell is this? Boost energy production for sustained</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2600" target="_blank">00:43:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">vitality. What does that mean? So one thing you could of course do is you could open up Google</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2605" target="_blank">00:43:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">search and look at the Wikipedia page or something like that, and do everything that you're kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2609" target="_blank">00:43:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">used to. But Deep Research allows you to basically take an alternate route. And it kind of like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2616" target="_blank">00:43:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">processes a lot of this information for you and explains it a lot better. So as an example, we can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2621" target="_blank">00:43:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">do something like this. This is my example prompt. CAKG is one of the health actives in Brian Johnson's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2627" target="_blank">00:43:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">blueprint at 2.5 grams per serving. Can you do research on CAKG? Tell me about why it might</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2633" target="_blank">00:43:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">be found in the longevity mix. It's possible efficacy in humans or animal models. It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2638" target="_blank">00:43:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">potential mechanism of action, any potential concerns or toxicity or anything like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2642" target="_blank">00:44:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, here I have this button available to me, and you won't unless you pay $200 per month right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2650" target="_blank">00:44:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But I can turn on Deep Research. So let me copy paste this and hit go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2653" target="_blank">00:44:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And now the model will say, "Okay, I'm going to research this." And then sometimes it likes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2659" target="_blank">00:44:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to ask clarifying questions before it goes off. So a focus on human clinical studies,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2664" target="_blank">00:44:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">animal models, or both. So let's say both. Specific sources, all sources, I don't know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2671" target="_blank">00:44:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">A comparison to other longevity compounds, not needed. Comparison, just AKG.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2678" target="_blank">00:44:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">We can be pretty brief. The model understands. And we hit go. And then, okay, I'll research CAKG,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2684" target="_blank">00:44:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">starting research. And so now we have to wait for probably about 10 minutes or so. And if you'd like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2690" target="_blank">00:44:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">to click on it, you can get a bunch of preview of what the model is doing on a high level.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2693" target="_blank">00:44:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So this will go off and it will do a combination of, like I said, thinking and internet search.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2700" target="_blank">00:45:00.160</a></span> | <span class="t">But it will issue many internet searches. It will go through lots of papers. It will look at papers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2705" target="_blank">00:45:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and it will think and it will come back 10 minutes from now. So this will run for a while. Meanwhile,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2710" target="_blank">00:45:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">while this is running, I'd like to show you equivalents of it in the industry. So inspired</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2717" target="_blank">00:45:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">by this, a lot of people were interested in cloning it. And so one example is, for example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2721" target="_blank">00:45:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">perplexity. So perplexity, when you go through the model dropdown, has something called deep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2725" target="_blank">00:45:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">research. And so you can issue the same queries here. And we can give this to the model. And so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2732" target="_blank">00:45:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">you can issue the same queries here. And we can give this to perplexity. And then grok, as well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2738" target="_blank">00:45:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">has something called deep search instead of deep research. But I think that grok's deep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2742" target="_blank">00:45:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">search is kind of like deep research, but I'm not 100% sure. So we can issue grok deep search</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2748" target="_blank">00:45:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">as well. Grok three, deep search, go. And this model is going to go off as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2756" target="_blank">00:45:56.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I think, where's my Chachapiti? So Chachapiti is kind of like maybe a quarter done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2764" target="_blank">00:46:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Perplexity is going to be done soon. Okay, still thinking. And grok is still going as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2771" target="_blank">00:46:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I like grok's interface the most. It seems like, okay, so basically it's looking up all kinds of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2777" target="_blank">00:46:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">papers, WebMD, browsing results, and it's kind of just getting all this. Now, while this is all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2783" target="_blank">00:46:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">going on, of course, it's accumulating a giant context window and it's processing all that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2788" target="_blank">00:46:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">information, trying to kind of create a report for us. So key points, what is CAKG and why is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2797" target="_blank">00:46:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">it in the longevity mix? How is it associated to longevity, et cetera? And so it will do citations</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2803" target="_blank">00:46:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and it will kind of like tell you all about it. And so this is not a simple and short response.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2807" target="_blank">00:46:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">This is kind of like, almost like a custom research paper on any topic you would like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2812" target="_blank">00:46:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this is really cool and it gives a lot of references potentially for you to go off</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2815" target="_blank">00:46:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and do some of your own reading and maybe ask some clarifying questions afterwards. But it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2820" target="_blank">00:47:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">actually really incredible that it gives you all these like different citations and processes the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2823" target="_blank">00:47:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">information for you a little bit. Let's see if Perplexity finished. Okay, Perplexity is still</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2829" target="_blank">00:47:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">researching and Chachapiti is also researching. So let's briefly pause the video and I'll come</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2835" target="_blank">00:47:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">back when this is done. Okay, so Perplexity finished and we can see some of the report</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2839" target="_blank">00:47:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that it wrote up. So there's some references here and some basic description. And then Chachapiti</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2846" target="_blank">00:47:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">also finished and it also thought for five minutes, looked at 27 sources and produced a report.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2852" target="_blank">00:47:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So here it talked about research in worms, Drosophila in mice and in human trials that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2861" target="_blank">00:47:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">are ongoing. And then the proposed mechanism of action and some safety and potential concerns</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2867" target="_blank">00:47:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and references, which you can dive deeper into. So usually in my own work right now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2873" target="_blank">00:47:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I've only used this maybe for like 10 to 20 queries so far, something like that. Usually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2878" target="_blank">00:47:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I find that the Chachapiti offering is currently the best. It is the most thorough, it reads the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2883" target="_blank">00:48:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">best, it is the longest, it makes most sense when I read it. And I think the Perplexity and the Grok</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2889" target="_blank">00:48:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">are a little bit shorter and a little bit briefer and don't quite get into the same detail as the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2897" target="_blank">00:48:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">deep research from Google, from Chachapiti right now. I will say that everything that is given to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2902" target="_blank">00:48:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">you here, again, keep in mind that even though it is doing research and it's pulling stuff in,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2907" target="_blank">00:48:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">there are no guarantees that there are no hallucinations here. Any of this can be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2912" target="_blank">00:48:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">hallucinated at any point in time. It can be totally made up, fabricated, misunderstood by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2916" target="_blank">00:48:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the model. So that's why these citations are really important. Treat this as your first draft.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2921" target="_blank">00:48:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Treat this as papers to look at, but don't take this as definitely true. So here, what I would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2927" target="_blank">00:48:47.520</a></span> | <span class="t">do now is I would actually go into these papers and I would try to understand, is Chachapiti</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2932" target="_blank">00:48:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">understanding it correctly? And maybe I have some follow-up questions, et cetera, so you can do all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2935" target="_blank">00:48:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">that. But still incredibly useful to see these reports once in a while, to get a bunch of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2940" target="_blank">00:49:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">sources that you might want to descend into afterwards. Okay, so just like before,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2944" target="_blank">00:49:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I wanted to show a few brief examples of how I've used deep research. So for example, I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2950" target="_blank">00:49:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">trying to change a browser because Chrome upset me, and so it deleted all my tabs. So I was looking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2959" target="_blank">00:49:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">at either Brave or Arc, and I was most interested in which one is more private. And basically,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2965" target="_blank">00:49:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Chachapiti compiled this report for me, and this was actually quite helpful. And I went into some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2970" target="_blank">00:49:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">of the sources and I understood why Brave is basically TLDR significantly better. And that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2976" target="_blank">00:49:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">why, for example, here, I'm using Brave because I've switched to it now. And so this is an example</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2981" target="_blank">00:49:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">of basically researching different kinds of products and comparing them. I think that's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2985" target="_blank">00:49:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">good fit for deep research. Here, I wanted to know about a life extension in mice. So it kind of gave</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2991" target="_blank">00:49:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">me a very long reading, but basically mice are an animal model for longevity, and different labs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=2998" target="_blank">00:49:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">have tried to extend it with various techniques. And then here, I wanted to explore LLM labs in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3004" target="_blank">00:50:04.240</a></span> | <span class="t">USA, and I wanted a table of how large they are, how much funding they've had, et cetera. So this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3011" target="_blank">00:50:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">is the table that it produced. Now, this table is basically hit and miss, unfortunately. So I wanted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3016" target="_blank">00:50:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to show it as an example of a failure. I think some of these numbers, I didn't fully check them,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3021" target="_blank">00:50:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">but they don't seem way too wrong. Some of this looks wrong. But the big omission I definitely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3026" target="_blank">00:50:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">see is that XAI is not here, which I think is a really major omission. And then also, conversely,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3032" target="_blank">00:50:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Hugging Face should probably not be here because I asked specifically about LLM labs in the USA.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3037" target="_blank">00:50:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And also, Eleuther AI, I don't think should count as a major LLM lab due to mostly its resources.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3045" target="_blank">00:50:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I think it's kind of a hit and miss. Things are missing. I don't fully trust these numbers. I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3050" target="_blank">00:50:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">have to actually look at them. And so again, use it as a first draft. Don't fully trust it. Still</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3056" target="_blank">00:50:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">very helpful. That's it. So what's really happening here that is interesting is that we are providing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3061" target="_blank">00:51:01.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the LLM with additional concrete documents that it can reference inside its context window. So the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3068" target="_blank">00:51:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">model is not just relying on the knowledge, the hazy knowledge of the world through its parameters</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3074" target="_blank">00:51:14.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and what it knows in its brain. We're actually giving it concrete documents. It's as if you and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3079" target="_blank">00:51:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I reference specific documents like on the internet or something like that, while we are kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3085" target="_blank">00:51:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">producing some answer for some question. Now, we can do that through an internet search or like a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3089" target="_blank">00:51:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">tool like this. But we can also provide these LLMs with concrete documents ourselves through a file</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3095" target="_blank">00:51:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">upload. And I find this functionality pretty helpful in many ways. So as an example, let's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3100" target="_blank">00:51:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">look at Clod because they just released Clod 3.7 while I was filming this video. So this is a new</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3105" target="_blank">00:51:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Clod model that is now the state of the art. And notice here that we have thinking mode now as a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3111" target="_blank">00:51:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">3.7. And so normal is what we looked at so far, but they just released extended best for math and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3117" target="_blank">00:51:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">coding challenges. And what they're not saying, but it's actually true under the hood, probably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3121" target="_blank">00:52:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">most likely, is that this was trained with reinforcement learning in a similar way that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3125" target="_blank">00:52:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">all the other thinking models were produced. So what we can do now is we can upload the documents</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3131" target="_blank">00:52:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that we wanted to reference inside its context window. So as an example, there's this paper that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3136" target="_blank">00:52:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">came out that I was kind of interested in. It's from ARC Institute. And it's basically a language</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3143" target="_blank">00:52:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">model trained on DNA. And so I was kind of curious. I mean, I'm not from biology, but I was kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3149" target="_blank">00:52:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">curious what this is. And this is a perfect example of what LLMs are extremely good for because you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3155" target="_blank">00:52:35.520</a></span> | <span class="t">can upload these documents to the LLM and you can load this PDF into the context window and then ask</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3161" target="_blank">00:52:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">questions about it and basically read the documents together with an LLM and ask questions off it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3167" target="_blank">00:52:47.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So the way you do that is you basically just drag and drop. So we can take that PDF and just drop it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3172" target="_blank">00:52:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">here. This is about 30 megabytes. Now, when Claude gets this document, it is very likely that they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3182" target="_blank">00:53:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">actually discard a lot of the images and that kind of information. I don't actually know exactly what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3188" target="_blank">00:53:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">they do under the hood and they don't really talk about it. But it's likely that the images are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3192" target="_blank">00:53:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">thrown away. Or if they are there, they may not be as well understood as you and I would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3199" target="_blank">00:53:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">understand them potentially. And it's very likely that what's happening under the hood is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3203" target="_blank">00:53:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">this PDF is basically converted to a text file and that text file is loaded into the token window.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3209" target="_blank">00:53:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And once it's in the token window, it's in the working memory and we can ask questions off it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3214" target="_blank">00:53:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So typically when I start reading papers together with any of these LLMs, I just ask for,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3219" target="_blank">00:53:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">"Can you give me a summary of this paper?" Let's see what Claude 3.7 says.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3229" target="_blank">00:53:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, I'm exceeding the length limit of this chat. Oh, God. Really? Oh, damn. Okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3240" target="_blank">00:54:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">well, let's try chat GPT. Can you summarize this paper?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3250" target="_blank">00:54:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And we're using GPT 4.0 and we're not using thinking, which is okay. We can start by not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3262" target="_blank">00:54:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">thinking. Reading documents. Summary of the paper, "Genome Modeling and Design Across All</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3271" target="_blank">00:54:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Domains of Life." So this paper introduces Evo 2 large-scale biological foundation model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3276" target="_blank">00:54:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and then key features and so on. So I personally find this pretty helpful. And then we can kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3288" target="_blank">00:54:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">of go back and forth. And as I'm reading through the abstract and the introduction, et cetera,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3292" target="_blank">00:54:52.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I am asking questions of the LLM and it's kind of making it easier for me to understand the paper.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3297" target="_blank">00:54:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Another way that I like to use this functionality extensively is when I'm reading books. It is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3302" target="_blank">00:55:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">rarely ever the case anymore that I read books just by myself. I always involve an LLM to help</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3308" target="_blank">00:55:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">me read a book. So a good example of that recently is The Wealth of Nations, which I was reading</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3313" target="_blank">00:55:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">recently. And it is a book from 1776 written by Adam Smith and it's kind of like the foundation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3317" target="_blank">00:55:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">of classical economics. And it's a really good book. And it's kind of just very interesting to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3322" target="_blank">00:55:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">me that it was written so long ago, but it has a lot of modern day kind of like, it's just got a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3327" target="_blank">00:55:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">lot of insights that I think are very timely even today. So the way I read books now, as an example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3332" target="_blank">00:55:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">is you basically pull up the book and you have to get access to like the raw content of that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3338" target="_blank">00:55:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">information. In the case of Wealth of Nations, this is easy because it is from 1776. So you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3343" target="_blank">00:55:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">just find it on Wealth Project Gutenberg as an example. And then basically find the chapter that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3349" target="_blank">00:55:49.360</a></span> | <span class="t">you are currently reading. So as an example, let's read this chapter from book one. And this chapter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3354" target="_blank">00:55:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I was reading recently, and it kind of goes into the division of labor and how it is limited by the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3361" target="_blank">00:56:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">extent of the market. Roughly speaking, if your market is very small, then people can't specialize.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3367" target="_blank">00:56:07.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And specialization is what is basically huge. Specialization is extremely important for wealth</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3374" target="_blank">00:56:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">creation because you can have experts who specialize in their simple little task. But you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3381" target="_blank">00:56:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">can only do that at scale because without the scale, you don't have a large enough market to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3386" target="_blank">00:56:26.720</a></span> | <span class="t">sell to your specialization. So what we do is we copy paste this book, this chapter, at least.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3394" target="_blank">00:56:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">This is how I like to do it. We go to say Claude and we say something like, "We are reading the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3401" target="_blank">00:56:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Wealth of Nations." Now remember, Claude has knowledge of the Wealth of Nations but probably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3407" target="_blank">00:56:47.520</a></span> | <span class="t">doesn't remember exactly the content of this chapter. So it wouldn't make sense to ask Claude</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3413" target="_blank">00:56:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">questions about this chapter directly because he probably doesn't remember what the chapter is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3416" target="_blank">00:56:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">about. But we can remind Claude by loading this into the context window. So we're reading the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3422" target="_blank">00:57:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Wealth of Nations. "Please summarize this chapter to start." And then what I do here is I copy paste.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3429" target="_blank">00:57:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Now in Claude, when you copy paste, they don't actually show all the text inside the text box.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3435" target="_blank">00:57:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">They create a little text attachment when it is over some size. And so we can click enter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3441" target="_blank">00:57:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And we just kind of like start off. Usually I like to start off with a summary of what this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3447" target="_blank">00:57:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">chapter is about just so I have a rough idea. And then I go in and I start reading the chapter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3452" target="_blank">00:57:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And if at any point we have any questions, then we just come in and just ask our question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3457" target="_blank">00:57:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And I find that basically going hand in hand with LLMs dramatically increases my retention,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3463" target="_blank">00:57:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">my understanding of these chapters. And I find that this is especially the case when you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3467" target="_blank">00:57:47.520</a></span> | <span class="t">reading, for example, documents from other fields, like for example, biology, or for example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3473" target="_blank">00:57:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">documents from a long time ago, like 1776, where you sort of need a little bit of help of even</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3478" target="_blank">00:57:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">understanding what the basics of the language. Or for example, I would feel a lot more courage</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3483" target="_blank">00:58:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">approaching a very old text that is outside of my area of expertise. Maybe I'm reading Shakespeare,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3487" target="_blank">00:58:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">or I'm reading things like that. I feel like LLMs make a lot of reading very dramatically more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3494" target="_blank">00:58:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">accessible than it used to be before, because you're not just right away confused. You can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3498" target="_blank">00:58:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">actually kind of go slowly through it and figure it out together with the LLM in hand. So I use this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3504" target="_blank">00:58:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">extensively, and I think it's extremely helpful.

Today, I do this clunky back and forth. So literally, I will find the book</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3516" target="_blank">00:58:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">somewhere, and I will copy paste stuff around. And I'm going back and forth. And it's extremely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3521" target="_blank">00:58:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">awkward and clunky. And unfortunately, I'm not aware of a tool that makes this very easy for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3526" target="_blank">00:58:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But obviously, what you want is as you're reading a book, you just want to highlight the passage and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3530" target="_blank">00:58:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">ask questions about it.

This is basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3569" target="_blank">00:59:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">saying that whatever I output it here is actually a computer program, please go off and run it and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3575" target="_blank">00:59:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">give me the result of running that computer program. So it is the integration of the language</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3580" target="_blank">00:59:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">model with a programming language here, like Python. So this is extremely powerful. Let's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3586" target="_blank">00:59:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">see the simplest example of where this would be used and what this would look like. So if I go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3592" target="_blank">00:59:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">go to ChachiPT, and I give it some kind of a multiplication problem, let's say 30 times 9,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3597" target="_blank">00:59:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">or something like that, then this is a fairly simple multiplication. And you and I can probably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3603" target="_blank">01:00:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">do something like this in our head, right? Like 30 times 9, you can just come up with the result</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3607" target="_blank">01:00:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">of 270, right? So let's see what happens. Okay, so LLM did exactly what I just did. It calculated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3615" target="_blank">01:00:15.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the result of the multiplication to be 270. But it's actually not really doing math, it's actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3620" target="_blank">01:00:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">more like almost memory work. But it's easy enough to do in your head. So there was no tool use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3627" target="_blank">01:00:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">involved here. All that happened here was just the zip file doing next token prediction and gave the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3634" target="_blank">01:00:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">correct result here in its head. The problem now is what if we want something more, more complicated?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3640" target="_blank">01:00:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So what is this times this? And now of course, this, if I asked you to calculate this, you would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3649" target="_blank">01:00:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">give up instantly because you know that you can't possibly do this in your head. And you would be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3653" target="_blank">01:00:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">looking for a calculator. And that's exactly what the LLM does now too. And OpenAI has trained</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3658" target="_blank">01:00:58.720</a></span> | <span class="t">ChachiPT to recognize problems that it cannot do in its head, and to rely on tools instead. So what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3664" target="_blank">01:01:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I expect ChachiPT to do for this kind of a query is to turn to tool use. So let's see what it looks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3669" target="_blank">01:01:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">like. Okay, there we go. So what's opened up here is what's called the Python interpreter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3676" target="_blank">01:01:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And Python is basically a little programming language. And instead of the LLM telling you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3681" target="_blank">01:01:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">directly what the result is, the LLM writes a program. And then not shown here are special</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3688" target="_blank">01:01:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">tokens that tell the ChachiPT application to please run the program. And then the LLM pauses</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3693" target="_blank">01:01:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">execution. Instead, the Python program runs, creates a result, and then passes this result</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3700" target="_blank">01:01:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">back to the language model as text. And the language model takes over and tells you that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3705" target="_blank">01:01:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the result of this is that. So this is tool use, incredibly powerful. And OpenAI has trained</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3712" target="_blank">01:01:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">ChachiPT to kind of like know in what situations to lean on tools. And they've taught it to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3718" target="_blank">01:01:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that by example. So human labelers are involved in curating datasets that kind of tell the model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3725" target="_blank">01:02:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">by example in what kinds of situations it should lean on tools and how. But basically, we have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3730" target="_blank">01:02:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Python interpreter. And this is just an example of multiplication. But this is significantly more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3736" target="_blank">01:02:16.640</a></span> | <span class="t">powerful. So let's see what we can actually do inside programming languages. Before we move on,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3742" target="_blank">01:02:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I just wanted to make the point that unfortunately, you have to kind of keep track of which LLMs that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3747" target="_blank">01:02:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">you're talking to have different kinds of tools available to them. Because different LLMs might</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3752" target="_blank">01:02:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">not have all the same tools. And in particular, LLMs that do not have access to the Python</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3756" target="_blank">01:02:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">interpreter or programming language, or are unwilling to use it might not give you correct</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3761" target="_blank">01:02:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">results in some of these harder problems. So as an example, here we saw that ChachiPT correctly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3767" target="_blank">01:02:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">used a programming language and didn't do this in its head. Grok3 actually, I believe, does not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3772" target="_blank">01:02:52.720</a></span> | <span class="t">have access to a programming language, like a Python interpreter. And here, it actually does</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3778" target="_blank">01:02:58.560</a></span> | <span class="t">this in its head and gets remarkably close. But if you actually look closely at it, it gets it wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3785" target="_blank">01:03:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">This should be 120 instead of 060. So Grok3 will just hallucinate through this multiplication</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3792" target="_blank">01:03:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and do it in its head and get it wrong. But actually, like remarkably close. Then I tried</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3798" target="_blank">01:03:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Clod. And Clod actually wrote, in this case, not Python code, but it wrote JavaScript code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3803" target="_blank">01:03:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But JavaScript is also a programming language and gets the correct result. Then I came to Gemini</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3809" target="_blank">01:03:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and I asked 2.0 Pro. And Gemini did not seem to be using any tools. There's no indication of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3815" target="_blank">01:03:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And yet, it gave me what I think is the correct result, which actually kind of surprised me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3820" target="_blank">01:03:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So Gemini, I think, actually calculated this in its head correctly. And the way we can tell that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3826" target="_blank">01:03:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">this is, which is kind of incredible, the way we can tell that it's not using tools is we can just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3830" target="_blank">01:03:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">try something harder. What is, we have to make it harder for it. Okay, so it gives us some result.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3839" target="_blank">01:03:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I can use my calculator here, and it's wrong, right? So this is using my MacBook Pro</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3846" target="_blank">01:04:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">calculator. And two, it's not correct, but it's like remarkably close, but it's not correct.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3853" target="_blank">01:04:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">But it will just hallucinate the answer. So I guess like my point is, unfortunately,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3859" target="_blank">01:04:19.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the state of the LLMs right now is such that different LLMs have different tools available</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3864" target="_blank">01:04:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">to them, and you kind of have to keep track of it. And if they don't have the tools available,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3868" target="_blank">01:04:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">they'll just do their best, which means that they might hallucinate a result for you. So that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3873" target="_blank">01:04:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">something to look out for. Okay, so one practical setting where this can be quite powerful is what's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3878" target="_blank">01:04:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">called chatgpt advanced data analysis. And as far as I know, this is quite unique to chatgpt itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3885" target="_blank">01:04:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And it basically gets chatgpt to be kind of like a junior data analyst who you can kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3891" target="_blank">01:04:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">collaborate with. So let me show you a concrete example without going into full detail. So first,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3897" target="_blank">01:04:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">we need to get some data that we can analyze and plot and chart, etc. So here in this case, I said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3903" target="_blank">01:05:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">let's research open AI evaluation as an example. And I explicitly asked chatgpt to use the search</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3908" target="_blank">01:05:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">tool because I know that under the hood, such a thing exists. And I don't want it to be hallucinating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3913" target="_blank">01:05:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">data to me, I want it to actually look it up and back it up and create a table where each year</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3918" target="_blank">01:05:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">we have the valuation. So these are the open AI evaluations over time. Notice how in 2015,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3924" target="_blank">01:05:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">it's not applicable. So the valuation is like unknown. Then I said now plot this use log scale</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3930" target="_blank">01:05:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">for y axis. And so this is where this gets powerful. chatgpt goes off and writes a program</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3936" target="_blank">01:05:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that plots the data over here. So it created a little figure for us, and it sort of ran it and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3943" target="_blank">01:05:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">showed it to us. So this can be quite nice and valuable because it's a very easy way to basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3948" target="_blank">01:05:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">collect data, upload data in a spreadsheet, visualize it, etc. I will note some of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3953" target="_blank">01:05:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">things here. So as an example, notice that we had NA for 2015, but chatgpt when it was writing the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3959" target="_blank">01:05:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">code, and again, I would always encourage you to scrutinize the code, it put in 0.1 for 2015.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3966" target="_blank">01:06:06.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And so basically, it implicitly assumed that it made the assumption here in code</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3972" target="_blank">01:06:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that the valuation of 2015 was 100 million. And because it put in 0.1, and kind of like did it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3979" target="_blank">01:06:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">without telling us. So it's a little bit sneaky. And that's why you kind of have to pay attention</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3983" target="_blank">01:06:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">a little bit to the code. So I'm familiar with the code, and I always read it. But I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3988" target="_blank">01:06:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I would be hesitant to potentially recommend the use of these tools,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3992" target="_blank">01:06:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">if people aren't able to like read it and verify it a little bit for themselves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=3996" target="_blank">01:06:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, fit a trendline and extrapolate until the year 2030. Mark the expected valuation in 2030.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4004" target="_blank">01:06:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So it went off, and it basically did a linear fit. And it's using scipy's curve fit. And it did this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4012" target="_blank">01:06:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and came up with a plot. And it told me that the valuation based on the trend in 2030 is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4019" target="_blank">01:06:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">approximately 1.7 trillion, which sounds amazing, except here, I became suspicious, because I see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4026" target="_blank">01:07:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">that chatgpt is telling me it's 1.7 trillion. But when I look here at 2030, it's printing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4032" target="_blank">01:07:12.720</a></span> | <span class="t">20271.7b. So it's extrapolation when it's printing the variable is inconsistent with 1.7 trillion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4042" target="_blank">01:07:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This makes it look like that valuation should be about 20 trillion. And so that's what I said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4047" target="_blank">01:07:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">print this variable directly by itself, what is it? And then it sort of like rewrote the code</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4052" target="_blank">01:07:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and gave me the variable itself. And as we see in the label here, it is indeed 20271.7b, etc.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4060" target="_blank">01:07:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So in 2030, the true exponential trend extrapolation would be a valuation of 20 trillion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4071" target="_blank">01:07:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So I was like, I was trying to confront chatgpt, and I was like, you lied to me, right? And it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4074" target="_blank">01:07:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">like, yeah, sorry, I messed up. So I guess I like this example, because number one, it shows the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4081" target="_blank">01:08:01.200</a></span> | <span class="t">power of the tool in that it can create these figures for you. And it's very nice. But I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4087" target="_blank">01:08:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">number two, it shows the trickiness of it, where, for example, here, it made an implicit assumption.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4093" target="_blank">01:08:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And here, it actually told me something. It told me just the wrong, it hallucinated 1.7 trillion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4099" target="_blank">01:08:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, it is kind of like a very, very junior data analyst. It's amazing that it can plot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4104" target="_blank">01:08:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">figures. But you have to kind of still know what this code is doing. And you have to be careful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4110" target="_blank">01:08:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and scrutinize it and make sure that you are really watching very closely, because your junior</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4114" target="_blank">01:08:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">analyst is a little bit absent minded, and not quite right all the time. So really powerful,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4122" target="_blank">01:08:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">but also be careful with this. I won't go into full details of advanced data analysis. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4127" target="_blank">01:08:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">there were many videos made on this topic. So if you would like to use some of this in your work,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4133" target="_blank">01:08:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">then I encourage you to look at some of these videos. I'm not going to go into the full detail.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4137" target="_blank">01:08:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So a lot of promise, but be careful. Okay, so I've introduced you to ChachiPT and advanced</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4142" target="_blank">01:09:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">data analysis, which is one powerful way to basically have LLMs interact with code,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4147" target="_blank">01:09:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and add some UI elements like showing of figures and things like that. I would now like to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4152" target="_blank">01:09:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">introduce you to one more related tool. And that is specific to Claude, and it's called artifacts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4158" target="_blank">01:09:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So let me show you by example what this is. So you have a conversation with Claude. And I'm asking,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4165" target="_blank">01:09:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">generate 20 flashcards from the following text. And for the text itself, I just came to the Adam</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4172" target="_blank">01:09:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Smith Wikipedia page, for example, and I copy pasted this introduction here. So I copy pasted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4178" target="_blank">01:09:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">this here and ask for flashcards. And Claude responds with 20 flashcards. So for example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4185" target="_blank">01:09:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">when was Adam Smith baptized on June 16, etc. When did he die? What was his nationality, etc.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4192" target="_blank">01:09:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So once we have the flashcards, we actually want to practice these flashcards. And so this is where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4197" target="_blank">01:09:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I continue the conversation, I say, now use the artifacts feature to write a flashcards app to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4203" target="_blank">01:10:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">test these flashcards. And so Claude goes off and writes code for an app that basically formats all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4213" target="_blank">01:10:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">of this into flashcards. And that looks like this. So what Claude wrote specifically was this core</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4219" target="_blank">01:10:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">code here. So it uses a react library, and then basically creates all these components,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4226" target="_blank">01:10:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">it hardcodes the q&a into this app, and then all the other functionality of it. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4233" target="_blank">01:10:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the cloud interface basically is able to load these react components directly in your browser.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4237" target="_blank">01:10:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you end up with an app. So when was Adam Smith baptized, and you can click to reveal the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4244" target="_blank">01:10:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">answer. And then you can say whether you got it correct or not. When did he die? What was his</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4250" target="_blank">01:10:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">nationality, etc. So you can imagine doing this, and then maybe we can reset the progress or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4254" target="_blank">01:10:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">shuffle the cards, etc. So what happened here is that Claude wrote us a super duper custom app just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4262" target="_blank">01:11:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">for us, right here. And typically, what we're used to is some software engineers write apps,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4270" target="_blank">01:11:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">they make them available, and then they give you maybe some way to customize them, or maybe to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4274" target="_blank">01:11:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">upload flashcards. Like for example, the Anki app, you can import flashcards and all this kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4278" target="_blank">01:11:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">stuff. This is a very different paradigm, because in this paradigm, Claude just writes the app just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4284" target="_blank">01:11:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">for you and deploys it here in your browser. Now keep in mind that a lot of apps you'll find on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4289" target="_blank">01:11:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">internet, they have entire backends, etc. There's none of that here, there's no database or anything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4294" target="_blank">01:11:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">like that. But these are like local apps that can run in your browser. And they can get fairly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4299" target="_blank">01:11:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">sophisticated and useful in some cases. So that's Claude artifacts. Now to be honest, I'm not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4306" target="_blank">01:11:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">actually a daily user of artifacts. I use it once in a while. I do know that a large number of people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4312" target="_blank">01:11:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">are experimenting with it, and you can find a lot of artifacts showcases because they're easy to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4316" target="_blank">01:11:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">share. So these are a lot of things that people have developed, various timers and games and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4321" target="_blank">01:12:01.440</a></span> | <span class="t">things like that. But the one use case that I did find very useful in my own work is basically the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4328" target="_blank">01:12:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">use of diagrams, diagram generation. So as an example, let's go back to the book chapter of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4334" target="_blank">01:12:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Adam Smith that we were looking at. What I do sometimes is we are reading The Wealth of Nations</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4340" target="_blank">01:12:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">by Adam Smith, I'm attaching chapter three and book one, please create a conceptual diagram of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4344" target="_blank">01:12:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">this chapter. And when Claude hears conceptual diagram of this chapter, very often it will write</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4350" target="_blank">01:12:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">code that looks like this. And if you're not familiar with this, this is using the mermaid</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4356" target="_blank">01:12:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">library to basically create or define a graph. And then this is plotting that mermaid diagram.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4365" target="_blank">01:12:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And so Claude analyzed the chapter and figures out that, okay, the key principle that's being</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4370" target="_blank">01:12:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">communicated here is as follows, that basically the division of labor is related to the extent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4375" target="_blank">01:12:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">of the market, the size of it. And then these are the pieces of the chapter. So there's the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4380" target="_blank">01:13:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">comparative example of trade and how much easier it is to do on land and on water, and the specific</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4387" target="_blank">01:13:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">example that's used. And that geographic factors actually make a huge difference here. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4392" target="_blank">01:13:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">the comparison of land transport versus water transport and how much easier water transport is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4398" target="_blank">01:13:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And then here we have some early civilizations that have all benefited from basically the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4404" target="_blank">01:13:24.240</a></span> | <span class="t">availability of water transport and have flourished as a result of it because they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4407" target="_blank">01:13:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">support specialization. So if you're a conceptual kind of like visual thinker,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4413" target="_blank">01:13:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and I think I'm a little bit like that as well, I like to lay out information as like a tree like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4419" target="_blank">01:13:39.040</a></span> | <span class="t">this, and it helps me remember what that chapter is about very easily. And I just really enjoy these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4423" target="_blank">01:13:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">diagrams and like kind of getting a sense of like, okay, what is the layout of the argument? How is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4427" target="_blank">01:13:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">it arranged spatially and so on. And so if you're like me, then you will definitely enjoy this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4432" target="_blank">01:13:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can make diagrams of anything, of books, of chapters, of source codes, of anything really.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4439" target="_blank">01:13:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I specifically find this fairly useful. Okay, so I've shown you that LLMs are quite good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4445" target="_blank">01:14:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">at writing code. So not only can they emit code, but a lot of the apps like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4450" target="_blank">01:14:10.080</a></span> | <span class="t">ChatGPT and Cloud and so on have started to like partially run that code in the browser.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4456" target="_blank">01:14:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So ChatGPT will create figures and show them, and Cloud Artifacts will actually like integrate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4461" target="_blank">01:14:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">your React component and allow you to use it right there in line in the browser.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4465" target="_blank">01:14:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, actually, majority of my time personally and professionally is spent writing code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4471" target="_blank">01:14:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">But I don't actually go to ChatGPT and ask for snippets of code, because that's way too slow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4475" target="_blank">01:14:35.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Like ChatGPT just doesn't have the context to work with me professionally to create code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4481" target="_blank">01:14:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And the same goes for all the other LLMs. So instead of using features of these LLMs in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4488" target="_blank">01:14:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">a web browser, I use a specific app. And I think a lot of people in the industry do as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4492" target="_blank">01:14:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And this can be multiple apps by now, VS Code, Windsurf, Cursor, etc. So I like to use Cursor</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4500" target="_blank">01:15:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">currently.

This is a program you download, and it references the files you have on your computer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4516" target="_blank">01:15:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And then it works with those files and edits them with you. So the way this looks is as follows.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4522" target="_blank">01:15:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Here I have a simple example of a React app that I built over a few minutes with Cursor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4530" target="_blank">01:15:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And under the hood, Cursor is using Cloud 3.7 Sonnet. So under the hood, it is calling the API</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4538" target="_blank">01:15:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">of Anthropic and asking Cloud to do all of this stuff. But I don't have to manually go to Cloud</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4545" target="_blank">01:15:45.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and copy-paste chunks of code around. This program does that for me and has all of the context of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4551" target="_blank">01:15:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">files in the directory and all this kind of stuff. So the app that I developed here is a very simple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4556" target="_blank">01:15:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">tic-tac-toe as an example. And Cloud wrote this in a few, probably a minute. And we can just play.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4564" target="_blank">01:16:04.240</a></span> | <span class="t">X can win. Or we can tie. Oh wait, sorry, I accidentally won. You can also tie.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4574" target="_blank">01:16:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'd just like to show you briefly, this is a whole separate video of how you would use Cursor</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4579" target="_blank">01:16:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to be efficient. I just want you to have a sense that I started from a completely new project,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4585" target="_blank">01:16:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and I asked the Composer app here, as it's called, the Composer feature, to basically set up a new</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4591" target="_blank">01:16:31.520</a></span> | <span class="t">React repository, delete a lot of the boilerplate, please make a simple tic-tac-toe app. And all of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4599" target="_blank">01:16:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">this stuff was done by Cursor. I didn't actually really do anything except for write five sentences.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4603" target="_blank">01:16:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And then it changed everything and wrote all the CSS, JavaScript, etc. And then I'm running it here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4610" target="_blank">01:16:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and hosting it locally and interacting with it in my browser. So that's Cursor. It has the context</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4617" target="_blank">01:16:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">of your apps, and it's using Cloud remotely through an API without having to access the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4623" target="_blank">01:17:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">web page. And a lot of people, I think, develop in this way at this time. And these tools have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4631" target="_blank">01:17:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">become more and more elaborate. So in the beginning, for example, you could only say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4636" target="_blank">01:17:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">change, like, oh, Control-K, please change this line of code to do this or that. And then after</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4643" target="_blank">01:17:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">that, there was a Control-L, Command-L, which is, oh, explain this chunk of code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4647" target="_blank">01:17:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can see that there's going to be an LLM explaining this chunk of code. And what's happening</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4654" target="_blank">01:17:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">under the hood is it's calling the same API that you would have access to if you actually did enter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4658" target="_blank">01:17:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">here. But this program has access to all the files, so it has all the context. And now what we're up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4664" target="_blank">01:17:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">to is not Command-K and Command-L. We're now up to Command-I, which is this tool called Composer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4671" target="_blank">01:17:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And especially with the new agent integration, the Composer is like an autonomous agent on your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4676" target="_blank">01:17:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">codebase. It will execute commands. It will change all the files as it needs to. It can edit across</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4684" target="_blank">01:18:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">multiple files. And so you're mostly just sitting back and you're giving commands. And the name for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4691" target="_blank">01:18:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">this is called Vibe Coding, a name with that I think I probably minted. And Vibe Coding just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4697" target="_blank">01:18:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">refers to giving control to Composer and just telling it what to do and hoping that it works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4705" target="_blank">01:18:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, worst comes to worst, you can always fall back to the good old programming because we have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4710" target="_blank">01:18:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">all the files here, we can go over all the CSS, and we can inspect everything. And if you're a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4716" target="_blank">01:18:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">programmer, then in principle, you can change this arbitrarily. But now you have a very helpful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4720" target="_blank">01:18:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">system that can do a lot of the low-level programming for you. So let's take it for a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4724" target="_blank">01:18:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">spin briefly. Let's say that when either X or O wins, I want confetti or something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4732" target="_blank">01:18:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And let's just see what it comes up with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4735" target="_blank">01:18:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, I'll add a confetti effect when a player wins the game. It wants me to run React Confetti,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4746" target="_blank">01:19:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">which apparently is a library that I didn't know about. So we'll just say okay. It installed it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4752" target="_blank">01:19:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and now it's going to update the app. So it's updating app.tsx, the TypeScript file,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4759" target="_blank">01:19:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">to add the confetti effect when a player wins. And it's currently writing the code,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4763" target="_blank">01:19:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">so it's generating. And we should see it in a bit. Okay, so it basically added this chunk of code,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4771" target="_blank">01:19:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and a chunk of code here, and a chunk of code here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4775" target="_blank">01:19:35.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we'll also add some additional styling to make the winning cell stand out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4781" target="_blank">01:19:41.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, still generating. Okay, and it's adding some CSS for the winning cells.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4789" target="_blank">01:19:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So honestly, I'm not keeping full track of this. It imported React Confetti.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4795" target="_blank">01:19:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">This all seems pretty straightforward and reasonable, but I'd have to actually like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4800" target="_blank">01:20:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">really dig in. Okay, it wants to add a sound effect when a player wins, which is pretty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4807" target="_blank">01:20:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">ambitious, I think. I'm not actually 100% sure how it's going to do that, because I don't know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4812" target="_blank">01:20:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">how it gains access to a sound file like that. I don't know where it's going to get the sound file</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4816" target="_blank">01:20:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">from. But every time it saves a file, we actually are deploying it. So we can actually try to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4826" target="_blank">01:20:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">refresh and just see what we have right now. Also, it added a new effect. You see how it kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4831" target="_blank">01:20:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">of like fades in, which is kind of cool. And now we'll win. Whoa, okay. Didn't actually expect that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4839" target="_blank">01:20:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">to work. This is really elaborate now. Let's play again. Whoa. Okay. Oh, I see. So it actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4855" target="_blank">01:20:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">paused and it's waiting for me. So it wants me to confirm the command. So make public sounds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4860" target="_blank">01:21:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I had to confirm it explicitly. Let's create a simple audio component to play victory sound,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4868" target="_blank">01:21:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">sound/victorymp3. The problem with this will be the victory.mp3 doesn't exist. So I wonder what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4875" target="_blank">01:21:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">it's going to do. It's downloading it. It wants to download it from somewhere. Let's just go along</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4881" target="_blank">01:21:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">with it. Let's add a fallback in case the sound file doesn't exist. In this case, it actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4892" target="_blank">01:21:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">does exist. And yep, we can git add and we can basically create a git commit out of this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4902" target="_blank">01:21:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So the composer thinks that it is done. So let's try to take it for a spin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4909" target="_blank">01:21:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So yeah, pretty impressive. I don't actually know where it got this sound file from.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4915" target="_blank">01:21:55.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know where this URL comes from, but maybe this just appears in a lot of repositories and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4921" target="_blank">01:22:01.600</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of cloud kind of like knows about it. But I'm pretty happy with this. So we can accept all. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4928" target="_blank">01:22:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">that's it. And then we, as you can get a sense of, we could continue to play the sound file.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4935" target="_blank">01:22:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And worst comes to worst, if we can't debug anything, we can always fall back to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4939" target="_blank">01:22:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">standard programming instead of vibe coding. Okay. So now I would like to switch gears again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4944" target="_blank">01:22:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Everything we've talked about so far had to do with interacting with the model via text. So we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4950" target="_blank">01:22:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">type text in and it gives us text back. What I'd like to talk about now is to talk about different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4956" target="_blank">01:22:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">modalities. That means we want to interact with the model via text. So we want to interact with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4961" target="_blank">01:22:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">these models in more native human formats. So I want to speak to it and I want it to speak back</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4966" target="_blank">01:22:46.560</a></span> | <span class="t">to me and I want to give images or videos to it and vice versa. I want it to generate images and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4972" target="_blank">01:22:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">videos back. So it needs to handle the modalities of speech and audio and also of images and video.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4978" target="_blank">01:22:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first thing I want to cover is how can you very easily just talk to these models?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4985" target="_blank">01:23:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So I would say roughly in my own news, 50% of the time I type stuff out on the keyboard and 50% of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4992" target="_blank">01:23:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">the time I'm actually too lazy to do that. And I just prefer to speak to the model. And when I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=4997" target="_blank">01:23:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">on mobile, on my phone, that's even more pronounced. So probably 80% of my queries are just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=5004" target="_blank">01:23:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">speech because I'm too lazy to type it out on the phone. Now, on the phone, things are a little bit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=5008" target="_blank">01:23:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">easy. So right now the Chatshubpt app looks like this.

And there's this new biological foundation model called EVO2</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=5924" target="_blank">01:38:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that is really at the forefront of all this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=5926" target="_blank">01:38:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">EVO2, OK.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=5927" target="_blank">01:38:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's trained on a massive data set called OpenGenome2, which covers over nine--</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=5933" target="_blank">01:38:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">OK, I think you get the rough idea. So there's a few things here. You can customize the podcast</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=5938" target="_blank">01:38:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and what it is about with special instructions. You can then regenerate it. And you can also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=5943" target="_blank">01:39:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">enter this thing called interactive mode, where you can actually break in and ask a question</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=5946" target="_blank">01:39:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">while the podcast is going on, which I think is kind of cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=5950" target="_blank">01:39:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So I use this once in a while when there are some documents or topics or papers that I'm not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=5955" target="_blank">01:39:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">usually an expert in. And I just kind of have a passive interest in. And I'm going out for a walk</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=5960" target="_blank">01:39:20.560</a></span> | <span class="t">or I'm going out for a long drive. And I want to have a custom podcast on that topic. And so I find</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=5966" target="_blank">01:39:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that this is good in niche cases like that, where it's not going to be covered by another podcast</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=5972" target="_blank">01:39:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that's actually created by humans. It's kind of like an AI podcast about any arbitrary niche</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=5977" target="_blank">01:39:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">topic you'd like. So that's Notebook Column. And I wanted to also make a brief pointer to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=5984" target="_blank">01:39:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">this podcast that I generated. It's like a season of a podcast called Histories of Mysteries.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=5989" target="_blank">01:39:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And I uploaded this on Spotify. And here I just selected some topics that I'm interested in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=5997" target="_blank">01:39:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And I generated a deep dive podcast on all of them. And so if you'd like to get a sense of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6001" target="_blank">01:40:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">what this tool is capable of, then this is one way to just get a qualitative sense. Go on this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6006" target="_blank">01:40:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">find this on Spotify and listen to some of the podcasts here and get a sense of what it can do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6012" target="_blank">01:40:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And then play around with some of the documents and sources yourself. So that's the podcast</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6017" target="_blank">01:40:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">generation interaction using Notebook Column. Okay, next up, what I want to turn to is images.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6022" target="_blank">01:40:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So just like audio, it turns out that you can re-represent images in tokens. And we can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6029" target="_blank">01:40:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">represent images as token streams. And we can get language models to model them in the same way as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6035" target="_blank">01:40:35.920</a></span> | <span class="t">we've modeled text and audio before. The simplest possible way to do this, as an example, is you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6041" target="_blank">01:40:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">take an image and you can basically create like a rectangular grid and chop it up into little patches.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6046" target="_blank">01:40:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And then image is just a sequence of patches. And every one of those patches you quantize.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6051" target="_blank">01:40:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So you basically come up with a vocabulary of say 100,000 possible patches. And you represent each</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6057" target="_blank">01:40:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">patch using just the closest patch in your vocabulary. And so that's what allows you to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6062" target="_blank">01:41:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">take images and represent them as streams of tokens. And then you can put them into context</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6066" target="_blank">01:41:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">windows and train your models with them. So what's incredible about this is that the language model,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6071" target="_blank">01:41:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">the transformer neural network itself, it doesn't even know that some of the tokens happen to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6075" target="_blank">01:41:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">text, some of the tokens happen to be audio, and some of them happen to be images. It just models</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6081" target="_blank">01:41:21.280</a></span> | <span class="t">statistical patterns of token streams. And then it's only at the encoder and at the decoder that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6086" target="_blank">01:41:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">we secretly know that, okay, images are encoded in this way, and then streams are decoded in this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6092" target="_blank">01:41:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">way back into images or audio. So just like we handled audio, we can chop up images into tokens</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6098" target="_blank">01:41:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and apply all the same modeling techniques and nothing really changes, just the token streams</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6103" target="_blank">01:41:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">change and the vocabulary of your tokens changes. So now let me show you some concrete examples of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6108" target="_blank">01:41:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">how I've used this functionality in my own life. Okay, so starting off with the image input,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6113" target="_blank">01:41:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to show you some examples that I've used LLMs where I was uploading images.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6120" target="_blank">01:42:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you go to your favorite ChassisPT or other LLM app, you can upload images usually and ask</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6126" target="_blank">01:42:06.240</a></span> | <span class="t">questions of them. So here's one example where I was looking at the nutrition label of Brian</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6131" target="_blank">01:42:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Johnson's longevity mix. And basically, I don't really know what all these ingredients are,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6135" target="_blank">01:42:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">right? And I want to know a lot more about them and why they are in the longevity mix.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6138" target="_blank">01:42:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is a very good example where first I want to transcribe this into text. And the reason I like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6144" target="_blank">01:42:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">to first transcribe the relevant information into text is because I want to make sure that the model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6149" target="_blank">01:42:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">is seeing the values correctly. Like I'm not 100% certain that it can see stuff. And so here when it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6156" target="_blank">01:42:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">puts it into a table, I can make sure that it saw it correctly. And then I can ask questions of this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6160" target="_blank">01:42:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">text. And so I like to do it in two steps whenever possible. And then for example, here I asked it to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6166" target="_blank">01:42:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">group the ingredients, and I asked it to basically rank them in how safe probably they are. Because I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6172" target="_blank">01:42:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">want to get a sense of, okay, which of these ingredients are, you know, super basic ingredients</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6177" target="_blank">01:42:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that are found in your multivitamin? And which of them are a bit more kind of like suspicious or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6183" target="_blank">01:43:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">strange or not as well studied or something like that. So the model was very good in helping me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6188" target="_blank">01:43:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">think through basically what's in the longevity mix and what may be missing on like why it's in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6193" target="_blank">01:43:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">there, et cetera. And this is again, a good first draft for my own research afterwards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6198" target="_blank">01:43:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">The second example I want to show is that of my blood test. So very recently I did like a panel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6204" target="_blank">01:43:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">of my blood test. And what they sent me back was this like 20 page PDF, which is super useless.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6209" target="_blank">01:43:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">What am I supposed to do with that? So obviously I want to know a lot more information. So what I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6213" target="_blank">01:43:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">did here is I uploaded all my results. So first I did the lipid panel as an example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6220" target="_blank">01:43:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and I uploaded little screenshots of my lipid panel. And then I made sure that ChachiPT sees</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6224" target="_blank">01:43:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">all the correct results. And then it actually gives me an interpretation. And then I kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6229" target="_blank">01:43:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">iterated and you can see that the scroll bar here is very low because I uploaded piece by piece all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6233" target="_blank">01:43:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">of my blood test results, which are great by the way. I was very happy with this blood test.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6240" target="_blank">01:44:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what I wanted to say is number one, pay attention to the transcription and make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6245" target="_blank">01:44:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">sure that it's correct. And number two, it is very easy to do this because on MacBook,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6249" target="_blank">01:44:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">for example, you can do control shift command four, and you can draw a window and it copy pastes that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6258" target="_blank">01:44:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">window into a clipboard. And then you can just go to your ChachiPT and you can control V or command</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6263" target="_blank">01:44:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">V to paste it in. And you can ask about that. So it's very easy to like take chunks of your screen</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6268" target="_blank">01:44:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and ask questions about them using this technique. And then the other thing I would say about this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6274" target="_blank">01:44:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">is that of course this is medical information and you don't want it to be wrong. I will say that in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6278" target="_blank">01:44:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">the case of blood test results, I feel more confident trusting ChachiPT a bit more because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6283" target="_blank">01:44:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">this is not something esoteric. I do expect there to be like tons and tons of documents about blood</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6287" target="_blank">01:44:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">test results. And I do expect that the knowledge of the model is good enough that it kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6291" target="_blank">01:44:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">understands these numbers, these ranges, and I can tell it more about myself and all this kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6295" target="_blank">01:44:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">of stuff. So I do think that it is quite good. But of course you probably want to talk to an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6301" target="_blank">01:45:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">actual doctor as well. But I think this is a really good first draft and something that maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6305" target="_blank">01:45:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">gives you things to talk about with your doctor, etc. Another example is I do a lot of math and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6311" target="_blank">01:45:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">code. I found this tricky question in a paper recently. And so I copy pasted this expression</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6318" target="_blank">01:45:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and I asked for it in text because then I can copy this text and I can ask a model what it thinks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6325" target="_blank">01:45:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the value of x is evaluated at pi or something like that. It's a trick question. You can try it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6330" target="_blank">01:45:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">yourself. Next example, here I had a Colgate toothpaste and I was a little bit suspicious</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6335" target="_blank">01:45:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">about all the ingredients in my Colgate toothpaste. And I wanted to know what the hell is all this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6339" target="_blank">01:45:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is Colgate. What the hell is all these things? So it transcribed it and then it told me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6343" target="_blank">01:45:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">a bit about these ingredients and I thought this was extremely helpful. And then I asked it, okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6349" target="_blank">01:45:49.360</a></span> | <span class="t">which of these would be considered safest and also potentially less safe? And then I asked it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6355" target="_blank">01:45:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">okay, if I only care about the actual function of the toothpaste and I don't really care about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6359" target="_blank">01:45:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">other useless things like colors and stuff like that, which of these could we throw out?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6363" target="_blank">01:46:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And it said that, okay, these are the essential functional ingredients and this is a bunch of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6366" target="_blank">01:46:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">random stuff you probably don't want in your toothpaste. And basically, spoiler alert,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6373" target="_blank">01:46:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">most of the stuff here shouldn't be there. And so it's really upsetting to me that companies</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6378" target="_blank">01:46:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">put all this stuff in your food or cosmetics and stuff like that when it really doesn't need to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6385" target="_blank">01:46:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">there. The last example I wanted to show you is, so this is a meme that I sent to a friend and my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6393" target="_blank">01:46:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">friend was confused like, oh, what is this meme? I don't get it. And I was showing them that Chachi</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6398" target="_blank">01:46:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Petit can help you understand memes. So I copy pasted this meme and asked explain. And basically,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6406" target="_blank">01:46:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">this explains the meme that, okay, multiple crows, a group of crows is called a murder.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6413" target="_blank">01:46:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And so when this crow gets close to that crow, it's like an attempted murder.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6416" target="_blank">01:46:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So yeah, Chachi Petit was pretty good at explaining this joke. Okay, now vice versa,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6423" target="_blank">01:47:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">you can get these models to generate images. And the OpenAI offering of this is called DALI,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6429" target="_blank">01:47:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and we're on the third version. And it can generate really beautiful images on basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6434" target="_blank">01:47:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">given arbitrary prompts. Is this the Golden Temple in Kyoto, I think? I visited, so this is really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6439" target="_blank">01:47:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">beautiful. And so it can generate really stylistic images and can ask for any arbitrary style of any</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6446" target="_blank">01:47:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">arbitrary topic, et cetera. Now, I don't actually personally use this functionality way too often.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6450" target="_blank">01:47:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So I cooked up a random example just to show you. But as an example, what are the big headlines</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6455" target="_blank">01:47:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">news today? There's a bunch of headlines around politics, health, international entertainment,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6461" target="_blank">01:47:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and so on. And I used search tool for this. And then I said, generate an image that summarizes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6466" target="_blank">01:47:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">today. And so having all of this in the context, we can generate an image like this, that kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6471" target="_blank">01:47:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">like summarizes today, just as an example. And the way I use this functionality is usually for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6480" target="_blank">01:48:00.160</a></span> | <span class="t">arbitrary content creation. So as an example, when you go to my YouTube channel, then this video,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6485" target="_blank">01:48:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's Reproduce GPT-2, this image over here was generated using a competitor actually to DALI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6492" target="_blank">01:48:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">called ideogram.ai. And the same for this image that's also generated by an AI. And this image</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6499" target="_blank">01:48:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">as well was generated, I think, also by ideogram, or this may have been Chachapiti, I'm not sure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6504" target="_blank">01:48:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So I use some of the tools interchangeably. So I use it to generate icons and things like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6508" target="_blank">01:48:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can just kind of like ask for whatever you want. Now, I will note that the way that this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6514" target="_blank">01:48:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">actually works, the image output, it's not done fully in the model currently with DALI 3. With</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6522" target="_blank">01:48:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">DALI 3, this is a separate model that takes text and creates image. And what's actually happening</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6528" target="_blank">01:48:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">under the hood here, in the current iteration of Chachapiti, is when I say generate an image that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6533" target="_blank">01:48:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">summarizes today, this will actually, under the hood, create a caption for that image. And that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6539" target="_blank">01:48:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">caption is sent to a separate model that is an image generator model. And so it's kind of like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6544" target="_blank">01:49:04.640</a></span> | <span class="t">stitched up in this way. But it's not like super important to, I think, fully understand at this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6549" target="_blank">01:49:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">point. So that is image output. Now, next up, I want to show you an extension where the model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6557" target="_blank">01:49:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">can actually like see video. And this is included in what I showed you previously called advanced</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6563" target="_blank">01:49:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">voice. It's not available on the web app, but it's available on the mobile app. So if we go to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6569" target="_blank">01:49:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">advanced voice, and we connect. So hello, I'm demonstrating the video capabilities. And I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6575" target="_blank">01:49:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">showing to the camera that there is a little video icon over there. And when you press it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6580" target="_blank">01:49:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">you can basically see, you can basically show the model different things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6584" target="_blank">01:49:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I can see the camera feed. It looks like you've got some black acoustic foam panels on the wall.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6591" target="_blank">01:49:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Are you testing out how well they reduce echo in the room?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6593" target="_blank">01:49:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I was testing out the acoustic foam. That's right. But it's not actually that helpful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6598" target="_blank">01:49:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes placement can make a big difference. Have you tried covering more corners or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6603" target="_blank">01:50:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">experimenting with different layouts? Okay, well, let's let's look at this. What book is this? Do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6608" target="_blank">01:50:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you know? Yes, that's Genghis Khan and the making of the modern world by Jack Weatherford. It's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6614" target="_blank">01:50:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">fascinating book about the impact of Genghis Khan on world history. Yeah, pretty good. Do you see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6619" target="_blank">01:50:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">this other book? What is it? That's surely you're joking, Mr. Feynman by Richard Feynman.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6626" target="_blank">01:50:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a collection of humorous anecdotes from the physicist's life. It's really entertaining.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6630" target="_blank">01:50:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And what is this? That's an Aeronet 4, a portable CO2 monitor. It measures carbon dioxide levels,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6640" target="_blank">01:50:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">temperature, humidity, and air pressure. It's quite useful for monitoring indoor air quality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6645" target="_blank">01:50:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're currently at 713, right? Do you think that's good or what?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6650" target="_blank">01:50:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">A CO2 level of 713 ppm is generally okay. It's normal for indoor spaces.

If it goes above 1000, you might need more ventilation. Got it. And how about this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6662" target="_blank">01:51:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">map? Do you know what this map is? Yes, that looks like a map of Middle Earth from J.R.R. Tolkien's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6670" target="_blank">01:51:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The Lord of the Rings. It's a great piece for any fan of the series. Yeah, good job.

You basically have the camera running, you can point it at stuff,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6685" target="_blank">01:51:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and you can just talk to the model. It is quite magical, super simple to use. I don't personally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6691" target="_blank">01:51:31.120</a></span> | <span class="t">use it in my daily life because I'm kind of like a power user of all the chat GPT apps,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6695" target="_blank">01:51:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and I don't kind of just like go around pointing at stuff and asking the model for stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6700" target="_blank">01:51:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I usually have very targeted queries about code and programming, etc. But I think if I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6704" target="_blank">01:51:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">demonstrating some of this to my parents or my grandparents and have them interact in a very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6708" target="_blank">01:51:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">natural way, this is something that I would probably show them, because they can just point</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6713" target="_blank">01:51:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the camera at things and ask questions. Now, under the hood, I'm not actually 100% sure that they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6717" target="_blank">01:51:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">currently consume the video. I think they actually still just take image sections, like for example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6725" target="_blank">01:52:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">they take one image per second or something like that. But from your perspective as a user of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6730" target="_blank">01:52:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">tool, it definitely feels like you can just stream it video and have it make sense. So I think that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6736" target="_blank">01:52:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">pretty cool as a functionality. And finally, I want to briefly show you that there's a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6741" target="_blank">01:52:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">tools now that can generate videos, and they are incredible, and they're very rapidly evolving.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6745" target="_blank">01:52:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not going to cover this too extensively because I don't...

I don't personally use them that much in my work, but that's just because I'm not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6754" target="_blank">01:52:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">in a kind of a creative profession or something like that. So this is a tweet that compares a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6758" target="_blank">01:52:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">number of AI video generation models as an example. This tweet is from about a month ago,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6763" target="_blank">01:52:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">so this may have evolved since. But I just wanted to show you that all of these models were asked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6770" target="_blank">01:52:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">to generate, I guess, a tiger in a jungle. And this is a tweet from a month ago, so this may</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6775" target="_blank">01:52:55.440</a></span> | <span class="t">have evolved since.

I think right now, VO2, I think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6786" target="_blank">01:53:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">is really near state-of-the-art and really good. Yeah, that's pretty incredible, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6794" target="_blank">01:53:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">This is OpenAI Sora,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6802" target="_blank">01:53:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">etc. And you can compare and contrast and use some of these tools that are dedicated to this problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6807" target="_blank">01:53:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, and the final topic I want to turn to is some quality of life features that I think are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6813" target="_blank">01:53:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">quite worth mentioning. So the first one I want to talk about is ChatGPT memory feature.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6818" target="_blank">01:53:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So say you're talking to ChatGPT, and you say something like, "When roughly do you think we'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6825" target="_blank">01:53:45.520</a></span> | <span class="t">speak Hollywood?" Now, I'm actually surprised that ChatGPT gave me an answer here because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6830" target="_blank">01:53:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I feel like very often, these models are very averse to actually having any opinions. And they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6834" target="_blank">01:53:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">say something along the lines of, "Oh, I'm just an AI. I'm here to help. I don't have any opinions,"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6838" target="_blank">01:53:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and stuff like that. So here, actually, it seems to have an opinion and say it says that the last</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6844" target="_blank">01:54:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">true peak before franchises took over was 1990s to early 2000s. So I actually happen to really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6850" target="_blank">01:54:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">agree with ChatGPT here. And I really agree, so totally agreed. Now, I'm curious what happens</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6859" target="_blank">01:54:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">here. Okay, so nothing happened. So what you can, basically, every single conversation like we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6868" target="_blank">01:54:28.560</a></span> | <span class="t">talked about begins with empty token window and goes until the end. The moment I do new conversation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6875" target="_blank">01:54:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">or a new chat, everything gets wiped clean. But ChatGPT does have an ability to save information</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6881" target="_blank">01:54:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">from chat to chat, but it has to be invoked. So sometimes ChatGPT will trigger it automatically,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6887" target="_blank">01:54:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">but sometimes you have to ask for it. So basically, say something along the lines of,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6892" target="_blank">01:54:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">"Can you please remember this?" Or like, "Remember my preference," or whatever,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6900" target="_blank">01:55:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">something like that. So what I'm looking for is, I think it's going to work. There we go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6908" target="_blank">01:55:08.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So you see this memory updated, believes that late 1990s and early 2000s was the greatest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6915" target="_blank">01:55:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">peak of Hollywood, et cetera. Yeah. And then it also went on a bit about 1970.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6923" target="_blank">01:55:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And then it allows you to manage memories. So we'll look into that in a second. But what's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6928" target="_blank">01:55:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">happening here is that ChatGPT wrote a little summary of what it learned about me as a person</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6932" target="_blank">01:55:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and recorded this text in its memory bank. And a memory bank is basically a separate piece of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6940" target="_blank">01:55:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">ChatGPT that is kind of like a database of knowledge about you. And this database of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6945" target="_blank">01:55:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">knowledge is always prepended to all the conversations so that the model has access to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6950" target="_blank">01:55:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">it. And so I actually really like this because every now and then the memory updates whatever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6956" target="_blank">01:55:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">you have conversations with ChatGPT. And if you just let this run and you just use ChatGPT</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6960" target="_blank">01:56:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">naturally, then over time, it really gets to know you to some extent. And it will start to make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6966" target="_blank">01:56:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">references to the stuff that's in the memory. And so when this feature was announced, I wasn't 100%</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6971" target="_blank">01:56:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">sure if this was going to be helpful or not. But I think I'm definitely coming around. And I've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6976" target="_blank">01:56:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">used this in a bunch of ways. And I definitely feel like ChatGPT is knowing me a little bit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6981" target="_blank">01:56:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">better over time and is being a bit more relevant to me. And it's all happening just by sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6987" target="_blank">01:56:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">natural interaction and over time through this memory feature. So sometimes it will trigger it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6993" target="_blank">01:56:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">explicitly. And sometimes you have to ask for it. Okay, now I thought I was going to show you some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=6998" target="_blank">01:56:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">of the memories and how to manage them. But actually, I just looked and it's a little too</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7001" target="_blank">01:56:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">personal, honestly. So it's just a database, it's a list of little text strings, those text strings,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7007" target="_blank">01:56:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">just make it to the beginning. And you can edit the memories, which I really like. And you can,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7013" target="_blank">01:56:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, add memories, delete memories, manage your memories database. So that's incredible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7018" target="_blank">01:56:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I will also mention that I think the memory feature is unique to ChatGPT. I think that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7023" target="_blank">01:57:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">other LLMs currently do not have this feature. And I will also say that, for example, ChatGPT is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7030" target="_blank">01:57:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">very good at movie recommendations. And so I actually think that having this in its memory</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7035" target="_blank">01:57:15.040</a></span> | <span class="t">will help it create better movie recommendations for me. So that's pretty cool. The next thing I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7039" target="_blank">01:57:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">wanted to briefly show is custom instructions. So you can, to a very large extent, modify your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7045" target="_blank">01:57:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">ChatGPT and how you like it to speak to you. And so I quite appreciate that as well. You can come</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7052" target="_blank">01:57:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to settings, customize ChatGPT. And you see here, it says, what traits should ChatGPT have?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7059" target="_blank">01:57:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And I just kind of like told it, just don't be like an HR business partner, just talk to me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7063" target="_blank">01:57:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">normally. And also just give me, I just love explanations, educations, insights, et cetera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7068" target="_blank">01:57:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So be educational whenever you can. And you can just probably type anything here and you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7072" target="_blank">01:57:52.560</a></span> | <span class="t">experiment with that a little bit. And then I also experimented here with telling it my identity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7080" target="_blank">01:58:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm just experimenting with this, et cetera. And I'm also learning Korean. And so here I'm kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7086" target="_blank">01:58:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">telling it that when it's giving me Korean, it should use this tone of formality. Otherwise,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7091" target="_blank">01:58:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">sometimes, or this is like a good default setting. Because otherwise, sometimes it might give me the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7096" target="_blank">01:58:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">informal or it might give me the way too formal and sort of tone. And I just want this tone by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7101" target="_blank">01:58:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">default. So that's an example of something I added. And so anything you want to modify about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7105" target="_blank">01:58:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">ChatGPT globally between conversations, you would kind of put it here into your custom instructions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7110" target="_blank">01:58:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I quite welcome this. And this, I think you can do with many other LLMs as well. So look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7116" target="_blank">01:58:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">for it somewhere in the settings. Okay. And the last feature I wanted to cover is custom GPTs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7121" target="_blank">01:58:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">which I use once in a while. And I like to use them specifically for language learning the most.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7126" target="_blank">01:58:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So let me give you an example of how I use these. So let me first show you maybe,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7131" target="_blank">01:58:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">they show up on the left here. So let me show you this one, for example, Korean Detailed Translator.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7136" target="_blank">01:58:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So no, sorry, I want to start with this one, Korean Vocabulary Extractor. So basically,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7144" target="_blank">01:59:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the idea here is I give it, this is a custom GPT, I give it a sentence, and it extracts vocabulary</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7152" target="_blank">01:59:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">in dictionary form. So here, for example, given this sentence, this is the vocabulary. And notice</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7158" target="_blank">01:59:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">that it's in the format of Korean, semicolon, English. And this can be copy pasted into Anki</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7166" target="_blank">01:59:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">flashcards app. And basically, this kind of, this means that it's very easy to turn a sentence</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7174" target="_blank">01:59:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">into flashcards. And now the way this works is basically, if we just go under the hood,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7179" target="_blank">01:59:39.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and we go to edit GPT, you can see that you're just kind of like, this is all just done via</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7185" target="_blank">01:59:45.920</a></span> | <span class="t">prompting. Nothing special is happening here. The important thing here is instructions. So when I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7190" target="_blank">01:59:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">pop this open, I just kind of explain a little bit of, okay, background information, I'm learning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7194" target="_blank">01:59:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Korean, I'm beginner, instructions. I will give you a piece of text, and I want you to extract</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7200" target="_blank">02:00:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the vocabulary. And then I give it some example output. And basically, I'm being detailed. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7207" target="_blank">02:00:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">when I give instructions to LLMs, I always like to number one, give it sort of the description,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7213" target="_blank">02:00:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">but then also give it examples. So I like to give concrete examples. And so here are four concrete</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7219" target="_blank">02:00:19.360</a></span> | <span class="t">examples. And so what I'm doing here really is I'm constructing what's called a few shot prompt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7223" target="_blank">02:00:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm not just describing a task, which is kind of like asking for performance in a zero shot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7228" target="_blank">02:00:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">manner, just like do it without examples. I'm giving it a few examples. And this is now a few</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7232" target="_blank">02:00:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">shot prompt. And I find that this always increases the accuracy of LLMs. So kind of, that's a,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7237" target="_blank">02:00:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I think, a general good strategy. And so then when you update and save this LLM, then just given a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7245" target="_blank">02:00:45.840</a></span> | <span class="t">single sentence, it does that task. And so notice that there's nothing new and special going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7250" target="_blank">02:00:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">All I'm doing is I'm saving myself a little bit of work, because I don't have to basically start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7256" target="_blank">02:00:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">from scratch, and then describe the whole setup in detail. I don't have to tell ChachiPT all of this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7264" target="_blank">02:01:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">each time. And so what this feature really is, is that it's just saving you prompting time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7270" target="_blank">02:01:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If there's a certain prompt that you keep reusing, then instead of reusing that prompt and copy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7275" target="_blank">02:01:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">pasting it over and over again, just create a custom Chachi, custom GPT, save that prompt a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7280" target="_blank">02:01:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">single time. And then what's changing per sort of use of it is the different sentence. So if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7286" target="_blank">02:01:26.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I give it a sentence, it always performs this task. And so this is helpful if there are certain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7291" target="_blank">02:01:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">prompts or certain tasks that you always reuse. The next example that I think transfers to every</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7297" target="_blank">02:01:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">other language would be basic translation. So as an example, I have this sentence in Korean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7302" target="_blank">02:01:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and I want to know what it means. Now many people will go to just Google Translate or something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7306" target="_blank">02:01:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">like that. Now famously, Google Translate is not very good with Korean. So a lot of people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7311" target="_blank">02:01:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">use Naver or Papago and so on. So if you put that here, it kind of gives you a translation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7318" target="_blank">02:01:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, these translations often are okay as a translation. But I don't actually really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7323" target="_blank">02:02:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">understand how this sentence goes to this translation. Like where are the pieces I need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7327" target="_blank">02:02:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">to like I want to know more and I want to be able to ask clarifying questions and so on. And so here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7331" target="_blank">02:02:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">it kind of breaks it up a little bit, but it's just like not as good because a bunch of it gets</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7336" target="_blank">02:02:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">omitted, right? And those are usually particles and so on. So I basically built a much better</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7340" target="_blank">02:02:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">translator in Chachi, PT, and I think it works significantly better. So I have a Korean detailed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7345" target="_blank">02:02:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">translator. And when I put that same sentence here, I get what I think is a much, much better</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7350" target="_blank">02:02:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">translation. So it's three in the afternoon now, and I want to go to my favorite cafe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7354" target="_blank">02:02:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is how it breaks up. And I can see exactly how all the pieces of it translate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7360" target="_blank">02:02:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">part by part into English. So chigumin, afternoon, etc. So all of this. And what's really beautiful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7368" target="_blank">02:02:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">about this is not only can I see all the little detail of it, but I can ask clarifying questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7375" target="_blank">02:02:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Right here. And we can just follow up and continue the conversation. So this is, I think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7379" target="_blank">02:02:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">significantly better, significantly better in translation than anything else you can get. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7384" target="_blank">02:03:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">if you're learning different language, I would not use a different translator other than Chachi,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7388" target="_blank">02:03:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">PT. It understands a ton of nuance. It understands slang. It's extremely good. And I don't know why</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7396" target="_blank">02:03:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">translators even exist at this point. And I think GPT is just so much better. Okay. And so the way</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7401" target="_blank">02:03:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">this works, if we go to here is if we edit this GPT, just so we can see briefly, then these are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7408" target="_blank">02:03:28.560</a></span> | <span class="t">the instructions that I gave it, you'll be giving a sentence a Korean, your task is to translate the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7413" target="_blank">02:03:33.280</a></span> | <span class="t">whole sentence into English first, and then break up the entire translation in detail. And so here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7419" target="_blank">02:03:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">again, I'm creating a few shot prompt. And so here's how I kind of gave it the examples because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7423" target="_blank">02:03:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">they're a bit more extended. So I used kind of like an XML like language, just so that the model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7428" target="_blank">02:03:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">understands that the example one begins here and ends here. And I'm using XML kind of tags.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7434" target="_blank">02:03:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so here's the input, I gave it, and here's the desired output. And so I just give it a few</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7440" target="_blank">02:04:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">examples, and I kind of like specify them in detail. And then I have a few more instructions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7447" target="_blank">02:04:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">here. I think this is actually very similar to human, how you might teach a human a task,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7452" target="_blank">02:04:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">like you can explain in words what they're supposed to be doing. But it's so much better if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7456" target="_blank">02:04:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you show them by example, how to perform the task. And humans, I think, can also learn in a few shot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7460" target="_blank">02:04:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">manner significantly more efficiently. And so you can program this in whatever way you like. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7466" target="_blank">02:04:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">then you get a custom translator that is designed just for you, and is a lot better than what you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7471" target="_blank">02:04:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">would find on the internet. And empirically, I find that ChachiPT is quite good at translation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7476" target="_blank">02:04:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">especially for like a basic beginner like me right now. Okay, maybe the last one that I'll show you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7481" target="_blank">02:04:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">just because I think it ties a bunch of functionality together is as follows. Sometimes I'm,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7486" target="_blank">02:04:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">for example, watching some Korean content. And here we see we have the subtitles, but the subtitles</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7491" target="_blank">02:04:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">are baked into video, into the pixels. So I don't have direct access to the subtitles. And so what I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7497" target="_blank">02:04:57.120</a></span> | <span class="t">can do here is I can just screenshot this. And this is a scene between Jinyoung and Seulgi in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7502" target="_blank">02:05:02.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Singles Inferno. So I can just take it, and I can paste it here. And then this custom GPT I called</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7510" target="_blank">02:05:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">KoreanCAP, first OCRs it, then it translates it, and then it breaks it down. And so basically it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7517" target="_blank">02:05:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">does that. And then I can continue watching, and anytime I need help, I will copy-paste the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7522" target="_blank">02:05:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">screenshot here, and this will basically do that translation. And if we look at it under the hood,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7527" target="_blank">02:05:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">in Edit GPT, you'll see that in the instructions, it just simply gives out, it just breaks down the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7537" target="_blank">02:05:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">instructions. So you'll be given an image crop from a TV show, Singles Inferno, but you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7541" target="_blank">02:05:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">change this, of course. And it shows a tiny piece of dialogue. So I'm giving the model sort of a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7546" target="_blank">02:05:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">heads up and a context for what's happening. And these are the instructions. So first OCR it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7551" target="_blank">02:05:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">then translate it, and then break it down. And then you can do whatever format you like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7556" target="_blank">02:05:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can play with this and improve it, but this is just a simple example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7560" target="_blank">02:06:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and this works pretty well. So yeah, these are the kinds of custom GPTs that I've built for myself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7566" target="_blank">02:06:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">A lot of them have to do with language learning, and the way you create these is you come here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7571" target="_blank">02:06:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and you click My GPTs, and you basically create a GPT, and you can configure it arbitrarily here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7577" target="_blank">02:06:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And as far as I know, GPTs are fairly unique to ChatGPT, but I think some of the other LLM apps</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7584" target="_blank">02:06:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">probably have a similar kind of functionality, so you may want to look for it in the project</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7589" target="_blank">02:06:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">settings. Okay, so I could go on and on about covering all the different features that are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7594" target="_blank">02:06:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">available in ChatGPT and so on, but I think this is a good introduction and a good bird's-eye view</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7599" target="_blank">02:06:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">of what's available right now, what people are introducing, and what to look out for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7603" target="_blank">02:06:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So in summary, there is a rapidly growing, changing, and shifting, and thriving ecosystem</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7611" target="_blank">02:06:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">of LLM apps like ChatGPT. ChatGPT is the first and the incumbent, and it's probably the most</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7618" target="_blank">02:06:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">feature-rich out of all of them, but all of the other ones are very rapidly growing and becoming</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7623" target="_blank">02:07:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">either reaching feature parity or even overcoming ChatGPT in some specific cases. As an example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7630" target="_blank">02:07:10.080</a></span> | <span class="t">ChatGPT now has internet search, but I still go to Perplexity, because Perplexity was doing search</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7636" target="_blank">02:07:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">for a while, and I think their models are quite good. Also, if I want to kind of prototype some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7642" target="_blank">02:07:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">simple web apps, and I want to create diagrams and stuff like that, I really like Cloud Artifacts,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7647" target="_blank">02:07:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">which is not a feature of ChatGPT. If I just want to talk to a model, then I think ChatGPT</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7653" target="_blank">02:07:33.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Advanced Voice is quite nice today, and if it's being too cagey with you, then you can switch to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7658" target="_blank">02:07:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Grok, things like that. So basically, all the different apps have some strengths and weaknesses,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7662" target="_blank">02:07:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">but I think ChatGPT by far is a very good default and the incumbent and most feature-rich.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7667" target="_blank">02:07:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, what are some of the things that we are keeping track of when we're thinking about these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7672" target="_blank">02:07:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">apps and between their features? So the first thing to realize, and that we looked at, is you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7676" target="_blank">02:07:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">talking basically to a zip file.

If you are using a model that is very large, that model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7690" target="_blank">02:08:10.080</a></span> | <span class="t">is going to have basically a lot of world knowledge, and it's going to be able to answer complex</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7695" target="_blank">02:08:15.040</a></span> | <span class="t">questions, it's going to have very good writing, it's going to be a lot more creative in its writing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7699" target="_blank">02:08:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and so on. If the model is very small, then probably it's not going to be as creative,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7703" target="_blank">02:08:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">it has a lot less world knowledge, and it will make mistakes. For example, it might hallucinate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7707" target="_blank">02:08:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">On top of that, a lot of people are very interested in these models that are thinking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7715" target="_blank">02:08:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and trained with reinforcement learning, and this is the latest frontier in research today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7718" target="_blank">02:08:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So in particular, we saw that this is very useful and gives additional accuracy in problems like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7724" target="_blank">02:08:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">math, code, and reasoning. So try without reasoning first, and if your model is not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7730" target="_blank">02:08:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">solving that kind of a problem, try to switch to a reasoning model and look for that in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7735" target="_blank">02:08:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">user interface. On top of that, then we saw that we are rapidly giving the models a lot more tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7741" target="_blank">02:09:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So as an example, we can give them an internet search. So if you're talking about some fresh</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7745" target="_blank">02:09:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">information or knowledge that is probably not in the zip file, then you actually want to use an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7749" target="_blank">02:09:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">internet search tool, and not all of these apps have it. In addition, you may want to give it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7755" target="_blank">02:09:15.600</a></span> | <span class="t">access to a Python interpreter so that it can write programs. So for example, if you want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7760" target="_blank">02:09:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">generate figures or plots and show them, you may want to use something like advanced data analysis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7764" target="_blank">02:09:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're prototyping some kind of a web app, you might want to use artifacts, or if you are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7768" target="_blank">02:09:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">generating diagrams, because it's right there and in line inside the app. Or if you're programming</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7773" target="_blank">02:09:33.280</a></span> | <span class="t">professionally, you may want to turn to a different app like Cursor and Composer. On top of all this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7779" target="_blank">02:09:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a layer of multi-modality that is rapidly becoming more mature as well, and that you may</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7784" target="_blank">02:09:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">want to keep track of. So we were talking about both the input and the output of all the different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7789" target="_blank">02:09:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">modalities, not just text, but also audio, images, and video. And we talked about the fact that some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7794" target="_blank">02:09:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">of these modalities can be sort of handled natively inside the language model. Sometimes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7799" target="_blank">02:09:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">these models are called omni-models or multi-modal models, so they can be handled natively by the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7804" target="_blank">02:10:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">language model, which is going to be a lot more powerful, or they can be tacked on as a separate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7809" target="_blank">02:10:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">model that communicates with the main model through text or something like that. So that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7814" target="_blank">02:10:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">a distinction to also sometimes keep track of. And on top of all this, we also talked about quality</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7818" target="_blank">02:10:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">of life features. So for example, file uploads, memory features, instructions, GPTs, and all this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7823" target="_blank">02:10:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of stuff. And maybe the last sort of piece that we saw is that all of these apps have usually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7830" target="_blank">02:10:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">a web kind of interface that you can go to on your laptop, or also a mobile app available on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7835" target="_blank">02:10:35.520</a></span> | <span class="t">your phone. And we saw that many of these features might be available on the app in the browser, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7840" target="_blank">02:10:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">not on the phone, and vice versa. So that's also something to keep track of. So all of this is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7845" target="_blank">02:10:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">little bit of a zoo. It's a little bit crazy, but these are the kinds of features that exist that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7849" target="_blank">02:10:49.360</a></span> | <span class="t">you may want to be looking for when you're working across all of these different apps.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7852" target="_blank">02:10:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And you probably have your own favorite in terms of personality or capability or something like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7857" target="_blank">02:10:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">that, but these are some of the things that you want to be thinking about and looking for and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7861" target="_blank">02:11:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">experimenting with over time. So I think that's a pretty good intro for now. Thank you for watching.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw&t=7867" target="_blank">02:11:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I hope my examples were interesting or helpful to you, and I will see you next time.</span></div></div></body></html>
