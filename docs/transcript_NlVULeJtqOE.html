And contrary to what most people say, they're like, we don't have the attention span. It's like if you took TikTok to someone in the 1800s, they would still watch it, right? It's not the human attention span that got shorter. It's just that we are better at telling stories quicker.</p><p>I don't need 400 pages to explain to you how to cook an egg. I could probably do it in 20 seconds with a YouTube short. Similarly, I think some people take way too long to get to the damn point. Even like an Instagram post, it's like a picture and like a paragraph of text is about as much as you need to explain a lot of different concepts.</p><p>I use what I call like a caveman voice. That's my little hack. We're like in my head, I'm like this dumb caveman. I barely pay attention to what I'm reading, which is how most people are reading your stuff. I try to think with that person just scrolling by, find this interesting or not.</p><p>And if it's too long, if it looks like a big block of text, that's kind of boring. And even I'm having trouble staying awake and reading it, that I just absolutely ax it, just ruthless. So the shortification of everything, can you say all of this stuff in one page or even one paragraph rather than 10?</p></div></div></body></html>
