It might be helpful first to give the context for the quote in "Let the Nations Be Glad"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXazG1PEpGg&t=67" target="_blank">00:01:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and explain what I was getting at there.

All of history is moving toward one great goal, the white,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXazG1PEpGg&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">hot worship of God and his son among all the peoples of the world.

So now the question is whether preaching the gospel to an unreached people group</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXazG1PEpGg&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">at the risk of your life is in some sense a greater activity than teaching algebra or pastoring a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXazG1PEpGg&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">local church like I did. That's still the question. My bias is to rank risk-taking missions among</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXazG1PEpGg&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">unreached peoples above my ministry, but let's think about it. Greg asked this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXazG1PEpGg&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">"Does this not posit a kind of hierarchy of human action which puts ordinary work lower on the rung</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXazG1PEpGg&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">of human activity? For example, being an artist or a janitor is not as great as being in mission</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXazG1PEpGg&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">work and therefore not as great in God's eyes." So the question in front of us is, should we ever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXazG1PEpGg&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">ascribe a kind of greatness to one human activity over another? And if so, in what sense and why?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXazG1PEpGg&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So to answer that, let's put a couple of Bible verses in front of us. 1 Timothy 5, 17, "Let the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXazG1PEpGg&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXazG1PEpGg&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">preaching and teaching." Another one, 1 Thessalonians 5, 12, "We ask you, brothers, to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXazG1PEpGg&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">respect or honor, recognize those who labor among you and are over you in the Lord and admonish you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXazG1PEpGg&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and to esteem them very highly in love because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXazG1PEpGg&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So it seems to me that at least in some sense it is fitting and right to describe some roles or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXazG1PEpGg&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">activities or vocations as having a certain kind of honor or esteem that other roles or activities</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXazG1PEpGg&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">don't have. For example, if the President of the United States comes to visit you in your house,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXazG1PEpGg&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">you will probably think of some ways of showing a special regard that you would not have thought of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXazG1PEpGg&t=305" target="_blank">00:05:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">if one of your friends drops by or even say the city councilman who lives in the neighborhood.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXazG1PEpGg&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think what we need to do is start making some distinctions and ask, okay, in what sense</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXazG1PEpGg&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">is one vocation or one human activity greater than another? Because we know from the Bible</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXazG1PEpGg&t=328" target="_blank">00:05:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">that there is an evil way to make distinctions. There is an evil ranking of people. James 1:9,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXazG1PEpGg&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">"Let the lowly brother boast in his exaltation and the rich in his humiliation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXazG1PEpGg&t=347" target="_blank">00:05:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">because like a flower of the grass he will pass away. For the sun rises with its scorching heat</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXazG1PEpGg&t=353" target="_blank">00:05:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and withers the grass. Its flower falls, its beauty perishes. So will the rich man fade away</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXazG1PEpGg&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.640</a></span> | <span class="t">in the midst of his pursuits." And Galatians 3:28, "There's neither Jew nor Greek. There's neither</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXazG1PEpGg&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">slave nor free." Those are pretty radical distinctions in role. "There is no male or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXazG1PEpGg&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">female. You're all one in Christ." Now that's the truth that Greg has taken hold of and wants to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXazG1PEpGg&t=383" target="_blank">00:06:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">make sure that we don't lose. And you add to the equality that we have in Christ, equally adopted,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXazG1PEpGg&t=392" target="_blank">00:06:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">fellow heirs of God, which is astonishing. You add to that the truth that a task, nevertheless,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXazG1PEpGg&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">can be measured in various ways. So example, "Compare the preparation and delivery of a sermon</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXazG1PEpGg&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to unbelievers in a hostile missionary setting. Compare that with the preparation and delivery</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXazG1PEpGg&t=417" target="_blank">00:06:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">of an algebra lesson to a class of compliant teenagers in a Christian school." Now, how do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXazG1PEpGg&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">we compare those two activities?

Or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXazG1PEpGg&t=447" target="_blank">00:07:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">there may be more faithfulness, more trust, more devotion, more humility in the preparation and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXazG1PEpGg&t=454" target="_blank">00:07:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">delivery of the algebra lesson than in the preparation and delivery of the sermon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXazG1PEpGg&t=459" target="_blank">00:07:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">There's the crucial truth that no activity in and of itself is a greater activity in the measure of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXazG1PEpGg&t=468" target="_blank">00:07:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">its worship and devotion and faith than any other if you just consider that, the devotion,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXazG1PEpGg&t=478" target="_blank">00:07:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the worship, the faithfulness.
