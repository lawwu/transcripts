On a daily basis I work on designing of small molecules with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=26" target="_blank">00:00:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">generative AI.

And this is a joint work with my colleague Derek Lowe,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=46" target="_blank">00:00:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">who is a medicinal chemist.

Probably I'm going to leave you with more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=56" target="_blank">00:00:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">questions than responses, more problems than solutions, but I think it's worthwhile.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=60" target="_blank">00:01:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So first I'm going to show you an interesting paradox in biology which led to a Nobel Prize</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=67" target="_blank">00:01:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">discovery. Then I'm going to be talking about reasoning with rags. And you've seen many different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=73" target="_blank">00:01:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">themes of rags and agentic rags during this conference, so I think it's fitting really nicely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">to all of the other topics. Scientific discovery framework which is how we can really build something,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=88" target="_blank">00:01:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">how we can build the system or rags specifically, which would help us in those scientific discoveries.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=93" target="_blank">00:01:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And in the end I'll show you a few examples of the experiments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So back in 1990s, early 90s, scientists were trying to improve the color of the flowers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">petunia flowers. You know, this is what you do when you're a scientist. So they were trying to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=114" target="_blank">00:01:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">overexpress the specific gene. So they wanted to get the color stronger. But what they get,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">they get the color flipped, which was really surprising. Nobody really knew what was happening</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and why was this happening, right? And this kind of results they were getting, biologists were getting,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">from different subdomains of biology. I'm not going to get into the details. I'm not a biologist,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm a computer scientist, so I'm going to save you all of that. But the interesting thing here is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">there were three different set of results, set of experiments, from different subdomains, even with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">different names. Everybody knew it was related to, something was messing with genes, but nobody knew why,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=155" target="_blank">00:02:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">right? So these three things, only after eight years, more or less,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">has been resolved, these three phenomena. And this is what led to Nobel Prize in biology, right,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">in medicine. And so the question is, can we really use LLMs to speed this up, right? It took eight years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.600</a></span> | <span class="t">There might be something in literature which could maybe give a hint of how we can go faster, right? And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">the question is, what are the underlying causes, or what might be the underlying causes of these three</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">phenomena, right? And now you're all thinking, okay, let's run the RAC, let's ask the question. Probably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.600</a></span> | <span class="t">it's going to get it quite quickly, right? Let's pause for a second and try to think how we can set this up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and try to experiment. But before it, okay, we all know what RAC is, naive RAC is. We have a question,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.520</a></span> | <span class="t">we process the question, we process previously before the data, we represent both of them in a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">given latent space, we do some kind of retrieval over the embeddings, and you get the response. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">there is a lot of different tricks. I wanted to show you just a bunch of them, because these tricks,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">like height, for example, or ranking, or document indexing, are things relating to different pieces</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">of RAC pipeline. And they are all for different purposes, slightly different purposes, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">They might try to try to fix the problem of matching between the question and answer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">they might try to fix the problem of the right retrieval of the top documents or top chunks,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and so on. But the problem is, if LLMs, and this is really interesting paper, if LLMs, and we know that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">cannot respond a little bit more catchy questions, right? A little bit more convoluted questions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">how we can expect that LLMs would understand the question, and then on top of that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">give us the right response with the RAC, right? So we are trying to run before we crawl.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I was thinking about it, and when you look at the literature, the papers, and the solutions during</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">this conference, you're going to realize there are themes kind of repeatedly referring to something which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=302" target="_blank">00:05:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">is happening before the retrieval. And one example of reasoning before the retrieval</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">is routing. Routing, which you have in iterating flows, is really the idea of doing something with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">the question, because we cannot throw it at the embeddings and just get the response, right? So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=322" target="_blank">00:05:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm naming it reasoning for a purpose, and you're going to understand it in a few slides, right? So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">you need to understand a little bit more. We need to understand a little bit more what's the question</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.920</a></span> | <span class="t">about, right? And on the other hand, not only with the question, because we also try to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">do something with the data, right? So, graph RAC or a graph reader, very interesting papers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">if you look at them, you're going to see that they are trying to represent the knowledge</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=356" target="_blank">00:05:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">from these documents in a little bit different way, specifically with graphs. You might use different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">representations in many different ways, but the point is we are doing something before the retrieval,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=367" target="_blank">00:06:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">which really is a reasoning to deal with the more semantically complex question. The reasoning after</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=375" target="_blank">00:06:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">the retrieval usually is done by delegated to LLM, right? Because this is all about LLMs, but that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=382" target="_blank">00:06:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">doesn't have to be the case. So, the point here really is that between more convoluted the semantics of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">the question, the harder it's going to be for your standard RAC without those reasoning steps. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=402" target="_blank">00:06:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you probably want to try to add these reasoning steps before it, and I'm going to show you some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">experiments with that. And small, by the way, is that, as I was saying, I work on a little bit different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=413" target="_blank">00:06:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">flavor of AI, right? Which is generative, but for graphs. So, kind of old style, encoder, decoder,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=422" target="_blank">00:07:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">values, now you have a latent space, and you navigate that. So, when I saw this thing which I draw,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=429" target="_blank">00:07:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">which is reasoning, embedding, retrieval, and then again reasoning, I realized that this is very similar</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=438" target="_blank">00:07:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">to what we do in, it's very well-known pipeline in chemistry, where you take a data set, which in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=445" target="_blank">00:07:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">that case are molecules, you represent them in the latent space, which are embeddings effectively,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=450" target="_blank">00:07:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and then you navigate the embeddings to optimize for that. So, for a given purpose. So, you have the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=456" target="_blank">00:07:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">latent space, and you want to extract the points which are the most interesting for your purpose,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=461" target="_blank">00:07:41.280</a></span> | <span class="t">right? So, in our case, we are trying to extract the embeddings which are the most similar to the question,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=466" target="_blank">00:07:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">right? So, we do simple similarity. But in other domains, like chemistry, we run optimization over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=473" target="_blank">00:07:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">that latent space, and this is type of reasoning, really, right? So, I was like, aha, okay. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=478" target="_blank">00:07:58.720</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of common theme is appearing here. Now, the question is, do you really know? Do you really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=487" target="_blank">00:08:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">need it? How do I know if my question is complex or not? So, we all know nearly in high stack, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=496" target="_blank">00:08:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Test or experiment or benchmark. So, I'm not going to be focusing on that too much. So, let me go quite</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=505" target="_blank">00:08:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">quickly, you know, like find the perfect ingredient, the ingredient to build the perfect pizza, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=511" target="_blank">00:08:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And a little bit extended version of that is multi-needling high stack, discussed yesterday on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=520" target="_blank">00:08:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">one of the tracks as well, right? So, when you think about it, this is not only about the response which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=528" target="_blank">00:08:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">you're going to get, but this is also about the question and really relationship between the question</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=532" target="_blank">00:08:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and the response. And as I was saying, between more convoluted, semantically the question is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=539" target="_blank">00:08:59.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the harder it's going to be. So, how we can generalize it? And I was thinking about databases,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=543" target="_blank">00:09:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">right? I'm an engineer. So, one needle, one response, or one concept, one piece of information is like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=552" target="_blank">00:09:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">one-to-one relationship, like in databases. Then you have one-to-n, and then it appeared to my head that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=558" target="_blank">00:09:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">okay, if I have a few concepts put together in one question, this is a multi-thing versus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=569" target="_blank">00:09:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">finding one needle. And then you can extend it still to a few concepts hidden in a few chunks of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=575" target="_blank">00:09:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the document. So, really, you need to do a little bit more. You already see that, okay, you need to pass</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=580" target="_blank">00:09:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">somehow the complexity of the question so that you can get the right embeddings extracted.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=586" target="_blank">00:09:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is what kind of triggers your reasoning. If you have a few concepts in the question,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=595" target="_blank">00:09:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">you probably need the reasoning before the retrieval so that you know what to retrieve and how to do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=601" target="_blank">00:10:01.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I was mentioning reasoning, right? So, what reasoning really is? And there are many views on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=611" target="_blank">00:10:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that because, for example, we use chain of thought as a type of reasoning, right? But I'm thinking about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=616" target="_blank">00:10:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">reasoning as processing information in some logical way, right? So, we all know how we can do the aggregation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=623" target="_blank">00:10:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">how we can do simple arithmetic over the data. We also know what's logical reasoning, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=630" target="_blank">00:10:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So, there's also causal reasoning. If you extract specific entities from the data and causal relationships</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=637" target="_blank">00:10:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">between them, you might ask LLM, okay, what more you can hypothesize about this data or what maybe you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=644" target="_blank">00:10:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">can deduce, right? And there are papers about it. And this kind of starts working. Then you have algorithmic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=650" target="_blank">00:10:50.560</a></span> | <span class="t">reasoning, which I mentioned before. You have also probabilistic reasoning. So, we were trying to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=657" target="_blank">00:10:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to make LLMs reason in a probabilistic fashion, right? Like a Bayesian inference. There's also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=662" target="_blank">00:11:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">structured way of reasoning. This is a little bit different from causal because you might have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=666" target="_blank">00:11:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">a structure and you can expect some kind of compositionality over that structure, right? So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=673" target="_blank">00:11:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's also, of course, Arc Kaggle competition recently released with $1 million price for closer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=683" target="_blank">00:11:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">getting to AGI, right? This is reasoning over geometry. That's why it's so challenging because this is not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=689" target="_blank">00:11:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">typical type of reasoning, right? So, why am I saying this? Because usually what we do, we expect LLMs to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=701" target="_blank">00:11:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">perform all of these reasoning well, all of these reasoning well. And do we really need LLMs for that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=708" target="_blank">00:11:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Probably, yes, or maybe not. But you can also delegate these reasoning types to specific tools,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=715" target="_blank">00:11:55.440</a></span> | <span class="t">which are specialists in that. So, you can do causal inference with libraries for causal inference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=721" target="_blank">00:12:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">You can do algorithmic reasoning with specific Python, right? That's why we have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=727" target="_blank">00:12:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">REPL as a tool, right? Attached to your agent so that you can generate the code. And this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=733" target="_blank">00:12:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">this is kind of algorithmic reasoning, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=734" target="_blank">00:12:14.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So, let's try to come back to the problem and think how we can solve it, really, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=741" target="_blank">00:12:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we want to find the cause of these three phenomena. And we define the type of reasoning,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=746" target="_blank">00:12:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the type of retrieval, which is the relation between question and an answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=753" target="_blank">00:12:33.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And the particularities in our case are also that we are not, we don't want to build a rack to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=759" target="_blank">00:12:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">respond many different questions over specific data set, but we want to respond really one question,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=765" target="_blank">00:12:45.600</a></span> | <span class="t">right? And this is the question. We want to respond this really one question and we want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=770" target="_blank">00:12:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">process our data set as many times as we possibly can so that we extract all of the relevant themes in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=775" target="_blank">00:12:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">that. So, but the trick here is that LLMs during training have seen Wikipedia. So, they know about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=785" target="_blank">00:13:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">this problem and RNA inference because it happened in 1998. So, we need the groundedness, right? And this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=791" target="_blank">00:13:11.120</a></span> | <span class="t">is another aspect of it. So, when you think about different methods and where you are in your specific</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=797" target="_blank">00:13:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">use case in that computational efficiency versus groundedness, you immediately see,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=803" target="_blank">00:13:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">okay, which approaches might be more suitable for my case. And as I'm going to show you later on,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=808" target="_blank">00:13:28.560</a></span> | <span class="t">relevant classifier is one of the main things which we use because we can process all of the data set.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=817" target="_blank">00:13:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So, overall designing choices, you can see here, and this depends usually upon your specific question</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=826" target="_blank">00:13:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you have, the reasoning you need, the relationship between question and answering, and another aspect</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=832" target="_blank">00:13:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">like groundedness versus efficiency. So, when we have defined what type of question that is, so how we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=842" target="_blank">00:14:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">really want to test whether our solution is capable of doing this kind of discovery, right? So, you state</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=848" target="_blank">00:14:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the question, you define the type of question, but then you need to do the knowledge cutoff, which is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=853" target="_blank">00:14:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">basically you need to remove from the LLM the knowledge about the discovery. So, what we do, we use RAC</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=859" target="_blank">00:14:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and in that RAC we have only the scientific papers from before the discovery, right? So, that it doesn't cheat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=867" target="_blank">00:14:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we present it in the state of the situation, which was before the discovery, so that it can, we can simulate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=873" target="_blank">00:14:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that situation, right? And this is kind of a training, you can think about it as an agent training in that specific,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=881" target="_blank">00:14:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">on that specific scientific problem, on that specific data set, and the overarching goal is to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=886" target="_blank">00:14:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">have a system which would be able to make those discoveries on many different scientific problems</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=893" target="_blank">00:14:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and applying this the same the same scheme.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=896" target="_blank">00:14:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, the question is, how do we define the success of this experiment? So, the first level of success</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=906" target="_blank">00:15:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">would be, okay, find some hypothesis or what we really know from this data set, right? So, it's not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=915" target="_blank">00:15:15.040</a></span> | <span class="t">that we are asking specific questions. We want RAC to extract, okay, what do you know about this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=920" target="_blank">00:15:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">specific, anything related really to that problem? And don't read the text, forgive me the amount of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=927" target="_blank">00:15:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">text on these slides, but look at the graph, right? So, we want RAC to find those relationships between</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=934" target="_blank">00:15:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">different facts in our data set. Then the next level would be to find like less obvious links, because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=942" target="_blank">00:15:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">you remember there were three different subdomains of biology, right? So, those linkages are not obvious.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=948" target="_blank">00:15:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we wanted to get a little bit further. Ideally, if it's exhaustive, so finding all of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=954" target="_blank">00:15:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">facts from the data set, right? And the next level would be making new hypotheses, right? Which would be,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=963" target="_blank">00:16:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">okay, if I see this, I can go maybe one step further and hypothesize about a new relationship.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=970" target="_blank">00:16:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And the ideal situation, or like the high level of success, I'm not expecting to have this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=976" target="_blank">00:16:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">anytime soon. Otherwise, we're going to meet in Sweden. But this is really about finding not only</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=982" target="_blank">00:16:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">what can be, what is related between those different facts in the literature, but also explaining how that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=988" target="_blank">00:16:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">happens. And the interesting thing is that when the discovery happened, made by humans,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=993" target="_blank">00:16:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">we didn't know how it was happening. We know what was happening, but we didn't know how.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=998" target="_blank">00:16:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so the last part, I'm going to go quite quickly, because I have just a less than two minutes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=1004" target="_blank">00:16:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So, the naive RAC, we all know. I'm going to show a very, very, very nice trick, which is not very prevalent,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=1011" target="_blank">00:16:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">actually. Because when you have the distances, similarities between the question embedding and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=1017" target="_blank">00:16:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the embedding in your database, you might ask yourself, of course, how many embeddings are,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=1023" target="_blank">00:17:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">how many chunks are enough, right? Really. But you can do it, think about it mathematically. Because if you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=1028" target="_blank">00:17:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">if you see those distances, you can calculate the variances within the different clusters</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=1035" target="_blank">00:17:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">of those embeddings and between them.

So they are kind of telling you that the probably the giving you the most</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=1054" target="_blank">00:17:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">information, right? There is a snippet how you can do it. I'm going to go quite quickly. In this case,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=1063" target="_blank">00:17:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">we got we then got the ground as well, because it was using the knowledge from from after the discovery.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=1070" target="_blank">00:17:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So we need to make the prompt stronger, right? So we call it strict prompting. And then it got better,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=1078" target="_blank">00:17:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">right? And then what we do, we did the relevance classifier, which is really passing all of the chunks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=1083" target="_blank">00:18:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">in our data set through the LLM and asking whether this is relevant to our problem. Unfortunately,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=1088" target="_blank">00:18:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that wasn't very much informative, because it was kind of redundant to distance of the from the embeddings,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=1095" target="_blank">00:18:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">right? There was a discussion yesterday about it. But when we when we did the analysis of how relevant</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=1102" target="_blank">00:18:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">each paper is in the context of hypothesis advancing, so we built a more sophisticated prompt and thinking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=1111" target="_blank">00:18:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">about a little bit more about the scientist. This is when we got the hypothesis a little bit further,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=1116" target="_blank">00:18:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">right? So it found us all of the hypothesis in the literature related to DNA, but one to the RNA,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=1122" target="_blank">00:18:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and this is the right one, right? So we see already that it's going in the right direction. I'm going to skip it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=1126" target="_blank">00:18:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">in the interest of time, you're going to have access to it. So my point here is when we started doing this reasoning over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=1133" target="_blank">00:18:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the question and the database before the retrieval, we started getting closer to the results,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=1138" target="_blank">00:18:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">which are ground true results without cheating. So the conclusion is scientific discovery requires</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=1144" target="_blank">00:19:04.640</a></span> | <span class="t">solving harder than simple Q&A problems. Knowing your problem can help define more efficient rack</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=1150" target="_blank">00:19:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">architecture. Needle in the high stack might be generalized. I'm not saying that this is like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=1154" target="_blank">00:19:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">the best way of doing it, but this is already you see something new and interesting and harder problems</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=1159" target="_blank">00:19:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">might need reasoning, right? And of course you cannot forget about the brute force because if you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=1166" target="_blank">00:19:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">the use case where you can do it, check your LLM, maybe it's going to do better than the distance embeddings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=1175" target="_blank">00:19:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So thank you very much for giving me rushing, I hope this has helped.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbM7k3NauNI&t=1183" target="_blank">00:19:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you.</span></div></div></body></html>
