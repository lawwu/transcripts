So some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=44" target="_blank">00:00:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">folks use it for classification, others for, you know, a variety of different applications about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=47" target="_blank">00:00:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">clustering, so on and so forth. Voyage is available via the Voyage AI API, the Azure and AWS</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=54" target="_blank">00:00:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">marketplaces as well. And now we are a part of MongoDB. So representing MongoDB,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=59" target="_blank">00:00:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah, thank you. So we're representing MongoDB here. And, you know, we're all really excited</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=63" target="_blank">00:01:03.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to see what the future will hold. And the reason, you know, I think in the past when I would give</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=68" target="_blank">00:01:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">presentations like this, I'd actually talk very, very specifically about things like evaluating,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=73" target="_blank">00:01:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">evaluation for embeddings, right? I would talk about things like, you know, how do we rankers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=78" target="_blank">00:01:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">play a role in your ultimate retrieval stack? And today I want to go a little bit higher level.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to talk a little bit more about what I like to call AI search. I know it's a very, very broad term, has a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=89" target="_blank">00:01:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">lot of different meanings to different folks. But I want to go -- I want to start -- use that as a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">starting point and then talk about where we are today and also to a secondary extent where we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=96" target="_blank">00:01:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">going as well. So a quick agenda here for the next 10 or so minutes. The first I want to give a quick</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">refresher, you know, a little bit about embeddings, about search and retrieval more broadly in this day</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and age. Then I'll talk about some real world applications. I think each of the applications -- there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=114" target="_blank">00:01:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">going to be three. Each of the applications I'm going to talk about -- I'll probably spend about a minute</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=118" target="_blank">00:01:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">each there -- there's going to be a lesson or something to learn or a key fact to take away from that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">application. And then what's most exciting, I think, to me and hopefully to the rest of you as well, is what's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">to come, right? Where's the future of AI-powered search and retrieval? And where are we going from here?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So a quick refresher. I'm going to blow through these pretty quickly. AI-powered search, at least how I define it, and how I hope this will continue to be defined moving forward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">is a search system that finds related concepts even without identical wording. I think this is very important, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So a lot of folks -- you may be familiar with things like TF-IDF or BM25. You know, AI-powered search goes way beyond that, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Not only -- it can understand keywords. It can help you retrieve based on some of these more traditional information retrieval algorithms. But it can also help you find related concepts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">To that point, it also understands the user's intent. So, for example, if I am in a -- you know, I'm trying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to search for some products to buy, something to buy, and I say my best friend is sick, perhaps it can recommend me some, you know, get well baskets or something like that, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.760</a></span> | <span class="t">It really should be able to understand what my ultimate meaning is, rather than just saying, hey, okay, my best friend is sick. Maybe, you know, I'm going to try to find something that's good for a best friend more generically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">The last thing that I'll mention is that it can perform some level of reasoning and some level of instruction following. And I'll get to that a little bit later in that last section.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But to get right into it, you know, a really popular use case of AI-powered search and retrieval is RAG. And I'm going to go through this pretty quickly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">The idea is that without retrieval, you either get probably some sort of hallucination, or in some cases, your LLM is just going to flat out refuse to respond to you, or it's going to give you a really, really generic answer like the one you see up here above.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But with retrieval, with AI-powered search built into it, you get a much, much more grounded response.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, this use case, I think, is pretty common. These are actually slides that I took from 10U's talk that's going to be happening at 12:15.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So you guys should definitely go to that if you're around. And the idea is that you generate embeddings, use that for search, and then you give it to your LLM.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Last thing I want to mention is that embedding quality here is a very, very core component of AI-powered search and retrieval.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think pretty much 95% to 99% of the systems I've seen out there, from what I gather, use embeddings in some way, shape, or form.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">The idea is that, again, you have embedding, you have this unstructured data, usually it's text, PDFs, Word documents, Google Drive files, PowerPoints, etc.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And you're able to embed them into a same space, such that when you do a search or you try to find a prompt, you have a prompt, you search for the most relevant documents,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">you're able to pull that information all the way up to the top.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm going to go through these pretty quickly. I'll try to spend about a minute each here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Some real-world applications of AI-powered search and retrieval. The first one is chatting with your code base.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is actually, if folks have heard of continue.dev, this is actually their application. A lot of their code is open source.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So first, you do, this is a classic RAG plus re-ranking approach.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the lesson from this particular application is that there is no one-size-fits-all embedding model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">There is no one-size-fits-all LLM.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Always do evaluations to see which one is best for your application.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, in this case, continue did theirs, and they found that Voyage Code 3 actually performs the best.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=328" target="_blank">00:05:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, the reason is because for a lot of chat with your code base applications, you want to have an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=334" target="_blank">00:05:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">embedding model and also to a secondary extent an LLM that is really, really good at understanding,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">well, code, documentation, and developers, so on and so forth. So this is the first lesson from the first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">application. The second one is that there's, you know, when it comes to the second one, again, it's also a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">very domain-specific application here. But the second one that I want to mention is if you see this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=355" target="_blank">00:05:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">build box here where there's some filtering and then there's some other structured data that's also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=361" target="_blank">00:06:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">passed to the search system, if this is the thing that I want to highlight for this particular application</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=367" target="_blank">00:06:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">is that oftentimes and, you know, coming from a company that builds embedding models, it's hard for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=373" target="_blank">00:06:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">me to say this. I think oftentimes embeddings alone are not enough, right? If you want to build a really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=377" target="_blank">00:06:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">powerful search and retrieval system, you need to have a lot of that structured data that's a part of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=383" target="_blank">00:06:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So to give you an example, beyond just this particular domain, you know, if I have,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">let's say, some legal documents, I embed those legal documents using Voyage Law 2, but then when I do my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=396" target="_blank">00:06:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">search, or if I'm building my agent, perhaps I want to understand, I want to know, hey, I only want to find</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=402" target="_blank">00:06:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">documents that are from a particular state, or maybe I want to find only official legal documents, or I want to find</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=408" target="_blank">00:06:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">documents that have a very, very particular set of details inside of them. This is all -- these are all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=414" target="_blank">00:06:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">things that can be done at the filtering stage. So this is typically done directly inside the vector</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=418" target="_blank">00:06:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">store. In some cases, it's done after that, right? So I want to say -- I want to be very, very clear,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=422" target="_blank">00:07:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">there is oftentimes -- and the second lesson here is that there's oftentimes other sources of data,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=426" target="_blank">00:07:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">other pieces of structured data that you need to include inside of your search system as well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=431" target="_blank">00:07:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">right? And then really, you know, just go beyond that. And then the last thing, you know, the last</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=437" target="_blank">00:07:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of application -- these are real world, these are actually built today -- the last thing that I want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=442" target="_blank">00:07:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to say is, when it comes to a lot of agentic retrieval, oftentimes, it's a feedback loop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=448" target="_blank">00:07:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So your AI search system is no longer just input, output, right? Sometimes, if you get a query,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=456" target="_blank">00:07:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you might want your LLM to, you know, do some searches, and then you might want your LLM to expand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=461" target="_blank">00:07:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">that query, or you might want your LLM to decompose that query. I'll give you a quick example. If I asked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=466" target="_blank">00:07:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">for something like, you know, what are Twitter's -- give me Twitter -- or I guess X now. You know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=471" target="_blank">00:07:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">give me X's Q4 -- you know, or 2024 earnings, right? You could -- your LLM could decompose that into Q1,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=479" target="_blank">00:07:59.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Q2, Q3, Q4 earnings, and then send that as four separate queries to these different vector stores,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=485" target="_blank">00:08:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to the different vector databases, so on and so forth. On top of this as well, you also see that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=490" target="_blank">00:08:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">we're in the era of agents, right? 2025, I would say, is the year of the agents, maybe even 2026 as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=495" target="_blank">00:08:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And a lot of agents, a lot of these agentic applications, they're gonna need to be really,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=500" target="_blank">00:08:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">really powerful at conversational data. So, you really want embeddings, you really want a search</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=505" target="_blank">00:08:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">system that's built around that. Now, there's a lot of details that's missing in this particular</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">block diagram, but I think hopefully that goes to show you sort of the lessons to take away from that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=515" target="_blank">00:08:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. So, this is the most -- so, you know, I just covered three existing applications. And hopefully,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=523" target="_blank">00:08:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">these applications, I think they give you a window into where we are today, you know, some of the tips,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=528" target="_blank">00:08:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">some of the tricks, just three of them that's being used today in these AI search systems. There's many,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=534" target="_blank">00:08:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">many out there, right? There's, I think, a lot to cover here. But I think what's more exciting to me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=539" target="_blank">00:08:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">is what's to come in AI-powered search and AI-powered retrieval. I don't know what happened to my arrows here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=546" target="_blank">00:09:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I apologize. I seem to sort of disappear in the background. But the future is 100% multimodal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=553" target="_blank">00:09:13.680</a></span> | <span class="t">That is the case for large language models. That is the case for embeddings. For AI search and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=558" target="_blank">00:09:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">retrieval overall, that's going to be the case as well. I think there's no doubt about that. And when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=562" target="_blank">00:09:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I say multimodal, I really -- I don't mean multimodal in the sense of, oh, you know, I'm an agent that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=567" target="_blank">00:09:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">operating in the real world. I can connect all these different modalities like site and touch and taste</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=573" target="_blank">00:09:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">together. I'm talking more about multimodality just from a pure sort of like a foundational perspective.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=580" target="_blank">00:09:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">The ability to understand images and text together or the ability to understand images, text, and audio</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=585" target="_blank">00:09:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">together. And it's going to be really important for search systems. It's going to be really important</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=589" target="_blank">00:09:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">for embedding models just as we have a lot of VLMs out there today. This particular example is Voyage</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=595" target="_blank">00:09:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">multimodal 3. Again, I apologize. I don't know what happened to the arrows here. But the idea here is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=601" target="_blank">00:10:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">it can take text, it can take images, or it can take a combination of text, interleave text and images,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=608" target="_blank">00:10:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and really embed all those into a single really powerful semantic space. So it might be a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=614" target="_blank">00:10:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">bit hard to understand exactly what's going on here, but the query being strong LLMs and the nearest sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=623" target="_blank">00:10:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">document being the Claude 3.5 blog post. So I hope that's a little bit clear here. I know, again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=628" target="_blank">00:10:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I know it might be a little bit harder to understand, but this is one of the things that I want to get to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=634" target="_blank">00:10:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The second thing that I also think is particularly exciting is instruction tuning. Instruction tuning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=640" target="_blank">00:10:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">into a secondary extent reasoning as well. So right now, if you look at embeddings and you look at embedding models,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=647" target="_blank">00:10:47.520</a></span> | <span class="t">they just take a query or they take a document and they give you a vector. I think moving forward,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=652" target="_blank">00:10:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">we're going to see situations where in addition to that query or in addition to that document,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=657" target="_blank">00:10:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">we want to be able to steer the vector in a particular direction or in a particular way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=663" target="_blank">00:11:03.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So to give an example, perhaps I want to, you know, in addition to my query, in addition to my prompt,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=669" target="_blank">00:11:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">in addition to my search, I also ask, I also give an instruction to say, find documents for me that only</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=676" target="_blank">00:11:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">dive into detail about this particular aspect. And that is where I think instruction tuning is really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=683" target="_blank">00:11:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">going to play a huge role moving forward for AI search and retrieval. Last thing that I want to talk</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=688" target="_blank">00:11:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">about is, and this is sort of a buzz wordy kind of term out there, is sort of the agent native database.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=694" target="_blank">00:11:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think this is where Voyage joining forces with MongoDB is super exciting for a lot of us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=699" target="_blank">00:11:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">The idea that today, a lot of search and retrieval, there's many, many multiple different components</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=704" target="_blank">00:11:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">that you have to put together. And what you see on the left is actually already a really, really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=708" target="_blank">00:11:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">simplified version of that. And the capability to move directly to something that is just a single</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=715" target="_blank">00:11:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">piece of infrastructure that does the embedding for you, it does the re-ranking for you, perhaps it does</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=719" target="_blank">00:11:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">some of that query augmentation or query decomposition for you. All of that inside a single data platform,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=725" target="_blank">00:12:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">inside a single database, I think that is super exciting. So I think this is something that you'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=730" target="_blank">00:12:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">see more and more of this year, and also next year as well, and something to look out for hopefully as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=734" target="_blank">00:12:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">well. So with that being said, I've got about three minutes left. Would love to take any questions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=739" target="_blank">00:12:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">if you have them. But I'll also leave this up for a couple more seconds. Feel free to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIPtpBZ6TKk&t=744" target="_blank">00:12:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">scan those QR codes, follow us, and I hope to see you sometime else at this conference.</span></div></div></body></html>
