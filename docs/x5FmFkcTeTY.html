And they're a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5FmFkcTeTY&t=1476" target="_blank">00:24:36.980</a></span> | <span class="t">fascinating asset class because they demonstrate that they're very risky in the short term,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5FmFkcTeTY&t=1480" target="_blank">00:24:40.980</a></span> | <span class="t">and yet they are absolutely riskless in real terms in the long term if you hold them until</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5FmFkcTeTY&t=1488" target="_blank">00:24:48.980</a></span> | <span class="t">maturity.

So the ideal strategy, if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5FmFkcTeTY&t=1502" target="_blank">00:25:02.980</a></span> | <span class="t">you're going to offset your liabilities, your future liabilities with TIPS, is to buy a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5FmFkcTeTY&t=1507" target="_blank">00:25:07.980</a></span> | <span class="t">ladder, a five-year ladder, one-year intervals, whatever you want to do. It's quite possible</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5FmFkcTeTY&t=1512" target="_blank">00:25:12.980</a></span> | <span class="t">to do. I think there's still a gap between '29 and '32, but you'll be able to do that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5FmFkcTeTY&t=1517" target="_blank">00:25:17.980</a></span> | <span class="t">soon enough.

So my suggestion is that you should never invest in a TIPS fund for at least two</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5FmFkcTeTY&t=1531" target="_blank">00:25:31.980</a></span> | <span class="t">reasons. Number one is you can generally buy TIPS cheaper, even than the cheapest TIPS</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5FmFkcTeTY&t=1536" target="_blank">00:25:36.980</a></span> | <span class="t">fund. And secondly, you might need the money at some point. And if you need the money at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5FmFkcTeTY&t=1545" target="_blank">00:25:45.980</a></span> | <span class="t">a point where TIPS are having the kinds of liquidity problems they had in '08, '09,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5FmFkcTeTY&t=1553" target="_blank">00:25:53.980</a></span> | <span class="t">your TIPS fund is going to have to take a haircut if you're going to need that money</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5FmFkcTeTY&t=1557" target="_blank">00:25:57.980</a></span> | <span class="t">out.

I think the proper</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5FmFkcTeTY&t=1563" target="_blank">00:26:03.980</a></span> | <span class="t">way to use them is not in a fund, but in a ladder.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5FmFkcTeTY&t=1569" target="_blank">00:26:09.980</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to ask you a question.

So the footnote is right there where you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5FmFkcTeTY&t=2587" target="_blank">00:43:07.980</a></span> | <span class="t">see it.

The obvious answer seems to be that we'll experience some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5FmFkcTeTY&t=2676" target="_blank">00:44:36.980</a></span> | <span class="t">catastrophe. We'll put a stop to that or at least level it out. But interestingly, I did</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5FmFkcTeTY&t=2682" target="_blank">00:44:42.980</a></span> | <span class="t">have the opportunity once to sit down at lunch with Bill Baumol, who's a very famous economist</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5FmFkcTeTY&t=2688" target="_blank">00:44:48.980</a></span> | <span class="t">and who's thought very deeply about these kinds of issues, particularly about the relationship</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5FmFkcTeTY&t=2692" target="_blank">00:44:52.980</a></span> | <span class="t">between technology and growth.

First of all, I think that our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5FmFkcTeTY&t=2722" target="_blank">00:45:22.980</a></span> | <span class="t">institutions are better than Rome's.
