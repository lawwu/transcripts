class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">versus what they could possibly do in the next six months.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=82" target="_blank">00:01:22.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I think there's just so much more that you could have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=85" target="_blank">00:01:25.560</a></span> | <span class="t">for a magical

agents are so capable,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.480</a></span> | <span class="t">but you also know that scaling to production is really hard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's easy to nail it for 10 conversations,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=96" target="_blank">00:01:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">but to do it for 10,000 or 100,000 becomes really difficult.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=100" target="_blank">00:01:40.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So a lot of times voice agents get stuck in POC hell</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.400</a></span> | <span class="t">where enterprises are scared to actually deploy them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to customer-facing issues or non-internal workflows.</span></div><div

today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=114" target="_blank">00:01:54.360</a></span> | <span class="t">There's conservative but deterministic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So you force the agent down the specific path</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and try and get it to do something exactly as you want it to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=123" target="_blank">00:02:03.080</a></span> | <span class="t">This is basically an expensive IVR tree.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.160</a></span> | <span class="t">You're using LLMs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.240</a></span> | <span class="t">but you're essentially forcing it into certain pathways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=129" target="_blank">00:02:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Or you can make them much more autonomous</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and flexible to new scenarios that they've never seen before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.640</a></span> | <span class="t">But this makes it really hard to scale it to production</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=138" target="_blank">00:02:18.760</a></span> | <span class="t">because they're so unpredictable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And so taking actions on behalf or interfacing with users</span></div><div

target="_blank">00:04:03.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and how they apply to voice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And hopefully that's useful because it's definitely been useful for us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.280</a></span> | <span class="t">as we interact with hundreds of voice systems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So what is the similarity between the two?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Self-driving and conversational evals are very similar</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.880</a></span> | <span class="t">because both of them are systems where you're interacting with the real world,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and for each step that you take, you have to respond to the environment and go back and forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And so simulations are really important for this because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.480</a></span> | <span class="t">for every step that I take in a Waymo or a self-driving car or a smaller robotics device,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.720</a></span> | <span class="t">or in a conversation, when I say, "Hello, what's your name?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.920</a></span> | <span class="t">you will respond differently than when I say, "Hello, what's your email?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So being able to simulate all of these possible scenarios is really important</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.520</a></span> | <span class="t">because otherwise you have to create these static tests or do it manually,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and both of which are either expensive or brittle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this doesn't make for very durable tests.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=302" target="_blank">00:05:02.600</a></span> | <span class="t">If you have to specifically outline every single step along the way,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=305" target="_blank">00:05:05.800</a></span> | <span class="t">those break immediately and are very expensive to maintain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And then lastly, coverage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.240</a></span> | <span class="t">You really want to simulate all of the possible scenarios across a very large area.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=316" target="_blank">00:05:16.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the non-determinism of LLMs is actually really useful for this because you can show</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.400</a></span> | <span class="t">what are all of the possible things that someone might respond back to this and I might simulate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that over and over and look for what the probability of my agent succeeding is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=329" target="_blank">00:05:29.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Another thing that I touched on a bit is input-output evals versus probabilistic evals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=338" target="_blank">00:05:38.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So with LLMs to date, we have seen that you run a set of inputs for your prompt,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.960</a></span> | <span class="t">excuse me, you run a set of inputs for your prompt and then you look at all the outputs and evaluate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.200</a></span> | <span class="t">whether or not the output for that input was correct based on some criteria.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=353" target="_blank">00:05:53.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So you might have a golden data set that you're iterating against.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=357" target="_blank">00:05:57.960</a></span> | <span class="t">With conversational evals, it becomes even more important to have reference-free evaluation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">where you don't necessarily need to say, "These are all of the expected things I am expecting for this exact input."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=370" target="_blank">00:06:10.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But rather, you're defining as a whole, "How often is my agent resolving the user inquiry?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=375" target="_blank">00:06:15.560</a></span> | <span class="t">How often is my agent repeating itself over and over?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=378" target="_blank">00:06:18.680</a></span> | <span class="t">How often is my agent saying things it shouldn't?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Rather than saying, "For this specific scenario, these six things should happen."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=386" target="_blank">00:06:26.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this is what's going to really allow you to scale your evals, and also what we did at Waymo.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=391" target="_blank">00:06:31.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So coming up with metrics that apply to lots of scenarios.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=395" target="_blank">00:06:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Another thing is that constant eval loops are what made autonomous vehicles scalable,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and that's what's going to make voice agents scalable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I think we're seeing today that voice agents are so expensive to maintain in production once you deploy to an enterprise,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.120</a></span> | <span class="t">it becomes often a professional service if you don't set up your processes right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=415" target="_blank">00:06:55.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you're constantly making all of these tweaks for specific enterprises, which can take up 80%</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=420" target="_blank">00:07:00.360</a></span> | <span class="t">of your time even after you've set up the initial agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So something that the autonomous vehicle industry has been doing is how do you run,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=429" target="_blank">00:07:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">like let's say you find a bug, and as an engineer, I might iterate on that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=433" target="_blank">00:07:13.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and I run a couple of evals to reproduce that, and then I fix the issue, and then I run more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=437" target="_blank">00:07:17.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So it wasn't stopping at a stop sign. I iterate on that, and now it is stopping at a stop sign.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=442" target="_blank">00:07:22.840</a></span> | <span class="t">But then I run a larger regression set, because maybe I just made the car stop every 10 seconds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=448" target="_blank">00:07:28.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I broke the everything. So then you run a larger regression set, and make sure you didn't break everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=453" target="_blank">00:07:33.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we have a set of pre-submit and post-submit CICD workflows.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=458" target="_blank">00:07:38.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So that before you ship code, and then after you push the code to production, we make sure everything is continuously working.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=465" target="_blank">00:07:45.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there's large-scale release evals. So making sure that everything is up to par before we launch a new release.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=472" target="_blank">00:07:52.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And this might be both manual evals and automated evals and some combination thereof.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=477" target="_blank">00:07:57.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And then live monitoring and detection, which then you can feed back into this whole system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=483" target="_blank">00:08:03.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're emulating a lot of this with voice. I think we think that's the right approach as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=491" target="_blank">00:08:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But you're notably that there's still manual evals involved. The goal is not to automate all evals,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=498" target="_blank">00:08:18.200</a></span> | <span class="t">but rather to leverage auto evals for speed and scale, and then use the manual time that you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=504" target="_blank">00:08:24.440</a></span> | <span class="t">to really focus on how those like very, you know, human touch judgment calls.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=510" target="_blank">00:08:30.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So the process that we've seen is you might start with simulated conversations,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=515" target="_blank">00:08:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and you run some happy paths of like, I know I should be able to book an appointment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=518" target="_blank">00:08:38.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So book an appointment for tomorrow. I run a bunch of simulations of that. I run evals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=524" target="_blank">00:08:44.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I come up with metrics of, I look through all those conversations. Looking at your data is super</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=528" target="_blank">00:08:48.520</a></span> | <span class="t">important. I look at all those conversations and I say, these are the ways they're failing. So I set</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=533" target="_blank">00:08:53.240</a></span> | <span class="t">up some automated metrics and iterate through this loop several times. Now I think it's ready for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=538" target="_blank">00:08:58.280</a></span> | <span class="t">production. So I ship it to production and then run those evals again. And so this cycle, this virtuous</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=544" target="_blank">00:09:04.120</a></span> | <span class="t">cycle of iterating on through simulation and then detecting, or like flagging things for human review,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=551" target="_blank">00:09:11.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and then feeding all of that back into your simulations is super important for scalable voice</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=555" target="_blank">00:09:15.560</a></span> | <span class="t">agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=555" target="_blank">00:09:15.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So what level of realism is actually needed?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=562" target="_blank">00:09:22.040</a></span> | <span class="t">A question we get a lot is, are your voice agents exactly how my customers sound?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=569" target="_blank">00:09:29.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's a good question because the level of realism is dependent on what you're trying to test.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=575" target="_blank">00:09:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So like any scientific method, right? You're trying to control variables and then test for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=580" target="_blank">00:09:40.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the things that you care about. So there's something we saw in self-driving is that there's kind of this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=585" target="_blank">00:09:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">hierarchy of like, you might not need to simulate everything in order to get a representative feedback</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=591" target="_blank">00:09:51.880</a></span> | <span class="t">on how your system is doing. So the way we think, so for example, all the time there are all these,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=597" target="_blank">00:09:57.720</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, super hyper-realistic simulations coming out that look like, you know, that look like a real</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=603" target="_blank">00:10:03.480</a></span> | <span class="t">video. And people would say that simulation system is amazing. And really that's not necessarily true</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=609" target="_blank">00:10:09.240</a></span> | <span class="t">because what you want from a simulation system is how much can you control what parts of the system</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=614" target="_blank">00:10:14.280</a></span> | <span class="t">you're simulating and then how, like what inputs are needed. So you might just need to know this is a dog</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=620" target="_blank">00:10:20.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and I, this is a cat and this is a person walking across the street. And then what should I do next</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=626" target="_blank">00:10:26.840</a></span> | <span class="t">as a result of those inputs? And so this is the same for voice.

So using, if you're like a medical company,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=934" target="_blank">00:15:34.440</a></span> | <span class="t">using medical terms that you're going to be using in production to test out different transcription methods,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=940" target="_blank">00:15:40.440</a></span> | <span class="t">etc. Then running task-based evals, which are maybe text or a very specific smaller modules of your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=946" target="_blank">00:15:46.600</a></span> | <span class="t">system. Again, what I talked about in self-driving is you don't necessarily need to enable every module</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDczF4wBh8s&t=951" target="_blank">00:15:51.400</a></span> | <span class="t">on the car in order to test the one thing that you're trying to test.
