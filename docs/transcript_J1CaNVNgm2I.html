And while they're in transit, you're not foregoing your earnings or any growth in those stocks, and you don't really need access to them on a day-to-day basis.</p><p>So it's a little bit easier in my mind than a bank bonus because it's kind of less invasive into your cashflow. So to evaluate these, I looked at 20 different brokerage bonuses, and some of them were household names, Schwab, Citi, E-Trade. Some were fintechs like Robinhood, Webull, and Public.</p><p>And some were brokerages that I wasn't really familiar with like TastyTrade and TradeStation. All were brokerages with SIPC protection, which usually protects you, I think, on $500,000 of balance. Similar but not the same as FDIC insurance.</p></div></div></body></html>
