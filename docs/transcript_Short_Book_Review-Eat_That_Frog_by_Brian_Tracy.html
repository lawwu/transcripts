Hey Radicals, this is Joshua Sheets, host of the Radical Personal Finance Podcast, here today with a book review for Brian Tracy's book, Eat That Frog. 21 great ways to stop procrastinating and get more done in less time. So, Eat That Frog by Brian Tracy.</p><p>This book for me is a five-star book review. I love this book. Now let me tell you why so you can decide if it's right and useful for you. But I absolutely love this book. Of all of the productivity books that I have read, this one is one of the most pithy, concise, and yet comprehensive books.</p><p>It's a great comprehensive overview that touches on each of the key important elements of productivity, but doesn't go too deep. And so for me, it's really, really useful as a reminder book, as a review book. There are many great books on productivity that go deep on the philosophy or on the science or on a specific tool.</p><p>A lot of them go shallow and just talk about the value of a certain tool, a certain approach. But there are very few books that give you a comprehensive overview and this is a great one to do that. Brian Tracy goes through 21 specific ideas and he starts with the big picture ideas of concept and of mindset, talking about how to make sure that you're doing the right things.</p><p>The biggest waste of time is to do something well that doesn't need to be done at all. Then focusing in on the highest priority things, how to run all the things that you do out of your list of goals to make sure that you're doing the right things. And then he ultimately goes down to some simple mindset tricks, some simple ways to make sure that you can trick yourself into being more focused and more productive.</p><p>For me, the major benefit of this book is as a constant review and refresher on productivity. If you think about it, the key for all of us is to be able to produce more valuable work during the time that we work. I learned from Brian Tracy the phrase, "It's quality of time at work that matters and quantity of time at home." And so his whole focus is to say, "During the time that you work, how can you make sure that you get the highest quality of output and the most of it so that you can spend more time, more quantity of time at home doing the things that you want to do with your family and being present with them?" So the focus of productivity is remember, we all get paid based upon the volume, the quality, and the value of the work that we produce.</p><p>So in order to get paid more, we always need to increase our output. We need to increase the value of that output and we need to increase the quantity of the output. So anything we can do to improve our working ability is going to be helping us. I don't know about you, but I don't find for me that I'm just some automatic productivity wizard all the time.</p><p>I find plenty of challenges that I'm never perfect. So the way I like to use Brian Tracy's book, "Eat That Frog" is as a continual review. It's a very short audio book, couple hours long, two and a half hours. I like to listen to it at 2x speed. So by listening to it at 2x speed, that means that I can listen to it in about an hour and a half.</p><p>And so once a month, if I take an hour and a half and I listen to the book, then I'll pick up on a little specific tip that I'm not doing well. Or I'll pick up on something that's important and meaningful to me today that another time I probably wouldn't have recognized.</p><p>And that's the primary value. This is one that I think is a must own. You definitely want to own this audio. You want to keep it on your phone or you want to own the book and you want to just have it regularly there so that it's a regular part of your routine, whether it's once a month or every couple of months, every six months.</p><p>You go through it again and look for the next thing that you can focus on. Because depending on where you are, it's going to be a little different. Are you prioritizing effectively? Are you only working on the things that need to be done? Do you have good systems? Do you need to upgrade your tools?</p><p>Whatever it is that's appropriate to you, you'll be able to pick that up as you consistently review this. So the book is Brian Tracy's "Eat That Frog." For me, it's a five star. Definitely a must buy. Don't expect it to be long. Don't expect it to be in depth.</p><p>But if you like the concept of that overview, this will be a useful book for you. I'll put a link to my Audible affiliate link in the description box. So if you'd like to sign up for Audible, you get two free e-books with that. This is again, I think this is definitely a must own book.</p><p>So this would be a good one to buy, an audio book version, or I'll put a link to the paper book or the Kindle book on Amazon as well in the description. Thanks for watching.</p></div></div></body></html>
