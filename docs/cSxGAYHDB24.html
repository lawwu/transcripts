That's my concern. Now, are there good reasons for taking the book of Job as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxGAYHDB24&t=129" target="_blank">00:02:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">an accurate account of events that really happened? Or do we just say, "Well, it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxGAYHDB24&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">a draw." I read some commentators who said, "It's just a draw. We don't know if it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxGAYHDB24&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">a parable or if it's history. It doesn't matter," they say. Let me give three reasons</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxGAYHDB24&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">for taking the story as real history rather than a parable with good morals and good theology.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxGAYHDB24&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Number one, take the way the book opens. There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxGAYHDB24&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Job and compare that with the beginning, say, of Judges 17.1, the beginning of the story</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxGAYHDB24&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.560</a></span> | <span class="t">there. There was a man in the hill country of Ephraim whose name was Micah. Or compare</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxGAYHDB24&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">it with the beginning of 1 Samuel 1.1. There was a certain man of Ramoth, Zopharim, of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxGAYHDB24&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the hill country of Ephraim whose name was Elkanah. Now, one of the ways to assess whether</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxGAYHDB24&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.840</a></span> | <span class="t">a piece of writing is history or whether it bears the traits of, say, fiction would be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxGAYHDB24&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to compare how the books are written. And the fact that Job begins the way those chapters</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxGAYHDB24&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.780</a></span> | <span class="t">begin which are not presented as parable or fiction is at least one pointer, just one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxGAYHDB24&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.160</a></span> | <span class="t">pointer to the way readers would have taken it as they begin to read this book. They would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxGAYHDB24&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.680</a></span> | <span class="t">have taken it the way they began to read Judges or 1 Samuel as an account of things that really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxGAYHDB24&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">matters. That's my first argument. Number two, in Ezekiel 14.12-20 where the prophet</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxGAYHDB24&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.800</a></span> | <span class="t">is showing how hopeless Jerusalem is under God's judgment because of how much immorality</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxGAYHDB24&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.200</a></span> | <span class="t">there is in the land, it says this, "The word of the Lord came to me, 'Son of man, when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxGAYHDB24&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">a land sins against me by acting faithlessly, and I stretch out my hand against it to break</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxGAYHDB24&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.100</a></span> | <span class="t">the supply of bread and send famine upon it and cut off from it man and beast, even if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxGAYHDB24&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they would deliver but only their own</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxGAYHDB24&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">lives by their righteousness.'" Verse 19, "Or if I send a pestilence into that land</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxGAYHDB24&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and pour out my wrath upon it with blood to cut off from it man and beast, even if Noah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxGAYHDB24&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Daniel, and Job were in it, as I live, declares the Lord God, they would deliver neither son</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxGAYHDB24&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">nor daughter. They would deliver but their own lives by their righteousness." Now, I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxGAYHDB24&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.320</a></span> | <span class="t">know that there are more or less conservative scholars who say that these names, Noah, Daniel,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxGAYHDB24&t=305" target="_blank">00:05:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Job, are mentioned here not because they're historical, but because they're all eminently</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxGAYHDB24&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.860</a></span> | <span class="t">righteous in the books that tell their story. Nevertheless, the case of Jerusalem is so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxGAYHDB24&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">bad, this writer, Ezekiel, chooses three people, two of which are manifestly historical, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxGAYHDB24&t=329" target="_blank">00:05:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the other of which we would presume is historical. Think with me. Notice two things. Noah and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxGAYHDB24&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Daniel are unmistakably historical. The Bible does not treat them as fictional ever. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxGAYHDB24&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Job is listed with them with no distinction made at all. And that would be really strange</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxGAYHDB24&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.040</a></span> | <span class="t">if Job were not like them, historical. And here's the second thing to observe. Ezekiel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxGAYHDB24&t=356" target="_blank">00:05:56.440</a></span> | <span class="t">entertains the hypothetical possibility that Noah and Daniel and Job might be, quote, "in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxGAYHDB24&t=364" target="_blank">00:06:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the land." Like if they were in the land, if they came into the land, you know, came</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxGAYHDB24&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">back from where they are. I mean, one of them is contemporary. It is a real stretch to think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxGAYHDB24&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">he is saying Noah and Daniel, the historical persons, might be in the land as real people,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxGAYHDB24&t=382" target="_blank">00:06:22.120</a></span> | <span class="t">but Job has to be thought of as in the land in a totally different way. In other words,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxGAYHDB24&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">it just seems to me that we would need very strong reasons to think Job is fictional if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxGAYHDB24&t=396" target="_blank">00:06:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">we're going to take Ezekiel 14, 14 in such a unnatural way. Two historical figures, one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxGAYHDB24&t=404" target="_blank">00:06:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">fictional functioning in the same way, I doubt it. Here's the last point. In James 5, in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxGAYHDB24&t=411" target="_blank">00:06:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the New Testament, James 5, verses 10 and 11, James says this, "As an example of suffering</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxGAYHDB24&t=417" target="_blank">00:06:57.580</a></span> | <span class="t">and patience, brothers, take the prophets." That's important. "Take the prophets." Think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxGAYHDB24&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.240</a></span> | <span class="t">about the prophets. "Who spoke in the name of the Lord. Behold, we consider those blessed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxGAYHDB24&t=428" target="_blank">00:07:08.040</a></span> | <span class="t">who remain steadfast." You've heard of the steadfastness of Job, and you have seen the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxGAYHDB24&t=433" target="_blank">00:07:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">purpose of the Lord, how the Lord is compassionate and merciful. Now again, there are those who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxGAYHDB24&t=438" target="_blank">00:07:18.360</a></span> | <span class="t">say, "This proves nothing about Job's historical reality. He's just being used as a fictional</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxGAYHDB24&t=443" target="_blank">00:07:23.640</a></span> | <span class="t">character the way we might use Shakespeare's Hamlet as an example of tragic indecision,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxGAYHDB24&t=449" target="_blank">00:07:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">say, and Job's being used as an example of perseverance." Really? I mean, James says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxGAYHDB24&t=455" target="_blank">00:07:35.880</a></span> | <span class="t">"Take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord. Behold, we consider those blessed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxGAYHDB24&t=463" target="_blank">00:07:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">who remain steadfast." You've heard of the steadfastness of Job. He's not speaking about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxGAYHDB24&t=467" target="_blank">00:07:47.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Job in a vacuum. He's treating Job like one of the prophets. He's putting him in the category</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxGAYHDB24&t=474" target="_blank">00:07:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">with others in history who remain steadfast. So I would say that we have at least these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxGAYHDB24&t=482" target="_blank">00:08:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">three lines of evidence that Job is historical, internal similarity to some of the other historical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxGAYHDB24&t=491" target="_blank">00:08:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">works, the treatment of Job in Ezekiel and the treatment of Job in James. And then Laurie</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSxGAYHDB24&t=498" target="_blank">00:08:18.920</a></span> | <span class="t">asks, "So do I think it matters?"
