But I think we just haven't done step two of AlphaGo, long story short. And we've just done</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXG2f-So9oo&t=594" target="_blank">00:09:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">imitation. And I don't think that people appreciate, number one, how terrible the data collection is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXG2f-So9oo&t=598" target="_blank">00:09:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">for things like ChashAPT. Say you have a problem, like some prompt is some kind of a mathematical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXG2f-So9oo&t=602" target="_blank">00:10:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">problem. A human comes in and gives the ideal solution to that problem. The problem is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXG2f-So9oo&t=608" target="_blank">00:10:08.560</a></span> | <span class="t">the human psychology is different from the model psychology. What's easy or hard for the human are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXG2f-So9oo&t=613" target="_blank">00:10:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">different to what's easy or hard for the model. And so human kind of fills out some kind of a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXG2f-So9oo&t=618" target="_blank">00:10:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">trace that comes to the solution. But some parts of that are trivial to the model. And some parts</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXG2f-So9oo&t=623" target="_blank">00:10:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">of that are a massive leap that the model doesn't understand. You're kind of just losing it. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXG2f-So9oo&t=626" target="_blank">00:10:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">then everything else is polluted by that later. And so fundamentally what you need is the model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXG2f-So9oo&t=631" target="_blank">00:10:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">needs to practice itself how to solve these problems. It needs to figure out what works for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXG2f-So9oo&t=637" target="_blank">00:10:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">it or does not work for it. But it needs to learn that for itself based on its own capability and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXG2f-So9oo&t=641" target="_blank">00:10:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">its own knowledge. So that's number one. That's totally broken, I think. It's a good initializer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXG2f-So9oo&t=645" target="_blank">00:10:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">though, for something agent-like. And then the other thing is we're doing reinforcement learning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXG2f-So9oo&t=648" target="_blank">00:10:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">from human feedback. But that's like a super weak form of reinforcement learning. It doesn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXG2f-So9oo&t=652" target="_blank">00:10:52.560</a></span> | <span class="t">even count as reinforcement learning, I think. So RLHF is like nowhere near, I would say, RL.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXG2f-So9oo&t=657" target="_blank">00:10:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like silly. And the other thing is imitation learning is super silly. RLHF is a nice improvement,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXG2f-So9oo&t=662" target="_blank">00:11:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">but it's still silly. And I think people need to look for better ways of training these models</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXG2f-So9oo&t=667" target="_blank">00:11:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">so that it's in the loop with itself and in some psychology. And I think there will probably be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXG2f-So9oo&t=671" target="_blank">00:11:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">unlocks in that direction. This echoes, again, Noam Brown, who I believe is working on OpenAI's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXG2f-So9oo&t=677" target="_blank">00:11:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Q* system, who said, "You don't get superhuman performance by doing better imitation learning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXG2f-So9oo&t=682" target="_blank">00:11:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">on human data."
