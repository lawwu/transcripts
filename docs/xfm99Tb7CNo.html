And I just want to give my best understanding of what's going on right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.620</a></span> | <span class="t">so different models that they can use with them and some tools support multiple models and so forth. And I just want to give my best understanding of what's going on right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And I also apologize for calling them agents. There's a lot of discussion of this is an appropriate name or not. It's probably not an appropriate name, but it is what it is. This is what seemingly we're calling this now. So it's it's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.620</a></span> | <span class="t">when I use agent here it's sort of an agentic coding tool in one form or another.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Just to level set this here. Roughly we're looking at five different types of tools. Some of them are IDE extensions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So GitHub Copilot cursor are probably the most well known ones. They're both autocomplete, but they can also do basic agentic coding loops. Cursor can actually do very capable coding loops at this point. In parts also because it's the case that we're working on right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you want to look at this, we're working on right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Cursor has recently moved into the CLI as well. And they are also providing these standalone agents. So Cursor, for instance, can run on a remote server, too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.620</a></span> | <span class="t">They have these background agents. Then the tools like Devon, which are also I think the bot windsurf currently recently. So these are all kind of these are different kind of tools exist.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we have these by coding tools that use very much the same kind of technology behind the scenes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So they're they're running, auto generating, running in a tool loop, but they often are very targeted towards user interface creation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And they behave quite a bit different from what you can do with with a tool like Cloud Code or similar, which really have they run on your machine and they can do pretty much everything that you give them access to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And when I recorded this last video here, there was really just a handful of tools that were capable of competing with Cloud Code, which was one of the first, if not the first that got mass adoption.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.620</a></span> | <span class="t">But by now, honestly, there are so many of them, I don't even want to enumerate them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.620</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think there are more than 30 different kind of command line tools at this point that that have some version of a gente coding loop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And I don't have the time to look at all of those tools. Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.620</a></span> | <span class="t">This is this is really not I don't have the time for that. And I don't think, honestly, anyone has time for that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.620</a></span> | <span class="t">But there are some reasons of why you want to look at more than one tool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.620</a></span> | <span class="t">For me, one of which is there has been a discussion recently about pricing and I will go into that later.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.620</a></span> | <span class="t">But because there is a worry that we might be heavily being subsidized by venture capital here, that the cost of all of this will go up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So people have been starting to look into can you use open models to do the same thing?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And for one reason or another, there are limitations in some of the tools that we're currently using.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's very helpful to understand if those limitations are related to the coding agent versus if they're related to the model and what this might mean in the future.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't want to talk too much about what kind of workloads work really well with a gente coding tools today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.620</a></span> | <span class="t">But I do want to mention that one of the main unlocks that I see today in a gente coding tools is the creation of software that can be perpetual prototypes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=356" target="_blank">00:05:56.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And some very good examples of this are internal tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=361" target="_blank">00:06:01.620</a></span> | <span class="t">You might have been in a situation multiple times through your career where you wish you would have had a slightly better debugging tool, but you also didn't have the time at this very moment to create them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=372" target="_blank">00:06:12.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is actually one of the ways in which I really enjoy using these tools is that I'm working on something, but I can also have the agent on the side provide me a better way to visualize my data or a better way to debug a particular problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=385" target="_blank">00:06:25.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And write a tool in a tool in a way that I can maybe use it a couple of times.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=389" target="_blank">00:06:29.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And it makes this this flow generally more enjoyable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=393" target="_blank">00:06:33.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And to create these tools, you're kind of in a situation where you want to be able to see what they do and interrupt and steer them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=407" target="_blank">00:06:47.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's a little bit of a combination of both hands off and hands on, which is very different from tools which are fully detached.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=416" target="_blank">00:06:56.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Devin is a good example here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=418" target="_blank">00:06:58.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I think a lot of the tools that sit as GitHub extensions on the pull request are a little bit like this, because it's much harder to understand if a change that you're doing to a prompt or a tool setup or something like this has a positive or negative effect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=435" target="_blank">00:07:15.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So these command line based tools or these IDE integrated tools, they make it easier to do rather quick experimentation, but it is still very hard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=446" target="_blank">00:07:26.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And we'll share a little bit later of why I think it's so hard to evaluate these.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=449" target="_blank">00:07:29.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So last time I talked about this, I think I made this assumption that there's a little bit more of an understanding of how these tools work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=460" target="_blank">00:07:40.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And I actually think that what I've discovered over the last couple of weeks is that there is a lack of understanding how they actually work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=468" target="_blank">00:07:48.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And this does make a sense a little bit because on one hand, it seems very simple.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=472" target="_blank">00:07:52.620</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a LLM that runs inference and then calls a bunch of tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=476" target="_blank">00:07:56.620</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you go into the nitty gritty details of how these agents work, there are some really rather important aspects to it that can fundamentally change how they behave.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=492" target="_blank">00:08:12.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And this also directly translates to their capabilities and what they cost and how long they run.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=501" target="_blank">00:08:21.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So the very basic behavior is obvious, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=505" target="_blank">00:08:25.620</a></span> | <span class="t">There's an agent decoding tool which has a system prompt that tells it something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=510" target="_blank">00:08:30.620</a></span> | <span class="t">It takes a user prompt and then it runs into a loop with a bunch of tools until the agent thinks it's done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=518" target="_blank">00:08:38.620</a></span> | <span class="t">But how all of this goes together and how they are actually capable of doing that and why we're actually seeing progress in these tools, I think, is rather subtle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=534" target="_blank">00:08:54.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So the most important tools that an agent needs is the ability to read a file.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=539" target="_blank">00:08:59.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And what does it mean?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=540" target="_blank">00:09:00.620</a></span> | <span class="t">It basically means that the agent is interested in seeing something and it reads the file and it reads it into its context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=547" target="_blank">00:09:07.620</a></span> | <span class="t">In order to understand which files it might want to read, it needs to find this code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=551" target="_blank">00:09:11.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, for instance, Cloud Code and a bunch of other tools, they use tools like grep, usually ripgrep, to have an idea of what they're looking for and then to find the file names and then to use that to pull it into the context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=565" target="_blank">00:09:25.620</a></span> | <span class="t">The combination of grep and the read file that will bring files into context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

tool to change the files on disk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=577" target="_blank">00:09:37.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And then for the agent decoding loop to work best, you need to be able to execute commands.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=586" target="_blank">00:09:46.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is particularly important for things like, can this even compile?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=590" target="_blank">00:09:50.620</a></span> | <span class="t">The most useful ability for an agent in many ways is just to understand if linters pass, if the compiler is able to compile it, and is it able to run the program that you have just changed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=605" target="_blank">00:10:05.620</a></span> | <span class="t">For some things, it also is capable of doing web searches or fetching remote files, things like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=611" target="_blank">00:10:11.620</a></span> | <span class="t">These are also useful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=613" target="_blank">00:10:13.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And with these tools, there are some rather subtle aspects to it which influence the quality of this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=628" target="_blank">00:10:28.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And I will go into this, but what you should think of with these tools is that you don't wake up in the morning and you determine as an agent decoding tool writer that you want to add a new tool to it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=640" target="_blank">00:10:40.620</a></span> | <span class="t">In a way you are, because this is what MCP does, but the best performing tools, they have been trained into the LLM in one form or another.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=651" target="_blank">00:10:51.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So the foundation model that you're using to some degree is an understanding of these tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=655" target="_blank">00:10:55.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And the consequence of this fundamental understanding of tooling is that there is some sort of binding between a particular coding agent or the tool used by an agent decoding agent and the model that it's using.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=672" target="_blank">00:11:12.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So there are different kinds of models that you can use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=680" target="_blank">00:11:20.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So for instance, Sonnet, you can use GPT-5.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=683" target="_blank">00:11:23.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And some of these models have been trained, not just with the knowledge that a tool exists, but also seemingly with a whole bunch of examples of what it means.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=691" target="_blank">00:11:31.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And Tropic actually does a pretty good job at documenting most of these tools in their documentation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=701" target="_blank">00:11:41.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you go to the API documentation on the Sonnet family of models or the Opus family of models, they will document these tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=709" target="_blank">00:11:49.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So as far as a bash tool, so it understands how to run bash commands.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=712" target="_blank">00:11:52.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And through the bash command, it also understands how to run Python.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=715" target="_blank">00:11:55.620</a></span> | <span class="t">It has a code execution command.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=718" target="_blank">00:11:58.620</a></span> | <span class="t">It has this computer use command, neither of which I believe are actually being used by cloud code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=724" target="_blank">00:12:04.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I think they might be used by cloud desktop, although I'm not sure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=727" target="_blank">00:12:07.620</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a text editor command that has been specifically trained on manipulating text, web search command, and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=736" target="_blank">00:12:16.620</a></span> | <span class="t">But for instance, if you use the GPT-OSS model, you will rather quickly figure out that it loves to call a tool called search, even if it hasn't been supplied to the context, particularly in the smaller model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=747" target="_blank">00:12:27.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And there the sort of the interesting element of this is that Codex also doesn't have a search tool, even though Codex is written by OpenAI, who also supplied GPT-OSS.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=761" target="_blank">00:12:41.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And the answer seemingly is that this is a tool that's being executed by the inference platform and not by the coding agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=772" target="_blank">00:12:52.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is probably similar to the web search tool, although again, I'm not really familiar how it's supposed to be used, but these tools effectively do not provide.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=781" target="_blank">00:13:01.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Normally, if you run a tool, you basically say like, hey, here are the tools that you can use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=787" target="_blank">00:13:07.620</a></span> | <span class="t">The LLM exposes, will reply, so it will reply with a JSON blob or some XML blob or something similar, saying like, hey, I want to use this tool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=798" target="_blank">00:13:18.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Then you would, in the agentic coding loop, execute a tool and provide the results back, and it makes another turn.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=805" target="_blank">00:13:25.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So with the server side or inference side tools, what actually happens is that you're not supposed to be able to call these tools because they will be called automatically behind the scenes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=816" target="_blank">00:13:36.620</a></span> | <span class="t">The results of those tools invocation will be immediately fed back into the prompt, and then they make a turn further.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=823" target="_blank">00:13:43.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of the results of this is the primary result of this is that if your agent does not match the tools with those models, then the experience that you're going to get from that agent is worse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=836" target="_blank">00:13:56.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And I really, really don't want to name any agentic coding tools today, but particularly coding tools that allow you to swap out the model and that are kind of open ended to which model you can use are also not necessarily going to map the tools exactly with either prompt and or tool naming or tool providing to those models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=864" target="_blank">00:14:24.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can sort of see this a little bit with a GPT-5 release.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=870" target="_blank">00:14:30.620</a></span> | <span class="t">There were a bunch of day one tools that came out, which had access to GPT-5 for two weeks or more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=879" target="_blank">00:14:39.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And at least on the first two days when I tried them, they outperformed tools which only added support for GPT-5 on the first day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=886" target="_blank">00:14:46.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Presumably because they got a little bit of a heads up of how they should match up prompts and tool usage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=898" target="_blank">00:14:58.620</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not just the tools that you provide that can have a significant impact on the agent's performance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=907" target="_blank">00:15:07.620</a></span> | <span class="t">In some cases, there are pre-flights and post-flights to each agentic coding loop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=914" target="_blank">00:15:14.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So I will go with the example of Claude here, Claude code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=920" target="_blank">00:15:20.620</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a little spinning indicator to the left of your prompt, which sort of makes up a little fancy cutie description.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=930" target="_blank">00:15:30.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And that comes by running the request also through Haiku, which is one of the fast models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=938" target="_blank">00:15:38.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And they will also for any tool usage that is emitted by the main model, which is usually Sonnet or Opus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=946" target="_blank">00:15:46.620</a></span> | <span class="t">They will also run it through Haiku in a form of like LLM as a judge to figure out if it's safe to run this tool or not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=952" target="_blank">00:15:52.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Which, for instance, means that it's much less likely that Claude code will delete the wrong file or will work outside of its working directory,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=966" target="_blank">00:16:06.620</a></span> | <span class="t">or at least outside of your project's directory than an agent that skips that step.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=971" target="_blank">00:16:11.620</a></span> | <span class="t">It is very possible for an agent to emit commands which are highly inappropriate to use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=983" target="_blank">00:16:23.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And having the second LLM make a sanity check on it will get rid of some of those users.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=991" target="_blank">00:16:31.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Not all of them, but some of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=993" target="_blank">00:16:33.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, for instance, I know for a fact that not every single agentic coding tool that exists today</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=999" target="_blank">00:16:39.620</a></span> | <span class="t">is safe to run with EULO mode, which is basically full permissions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1004" target="_blank">00:16:44.620</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, quite a few of them do not properly protect to the same degree that some others do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1013" target="_blank">00:16:53.620</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a second problem also, which is that once you give the agent the ability to run code,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1020" target="_blank">00:17:00.620</a></span> | <span class="t">you also have to figure out what to do if that code doesn't run properly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1026" target="_blank">00:17:06.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And there are definitely big quality differences in the tool's ability to run executables.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1038" target="_blank">00:17:18.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So, for instance, some tools get stuck and never recover.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1044" target="_blank">00:17:24.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I ran this yesterday. I will not name the agent that I was using, but I ran an agent yesterday at night before I went to bed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1053" target="_blank">00:17:33.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Actually, I ran three agents with one prompt overnight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1057" target="_blank">00:17:37.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Same prompt, just to see how they're using the same model differently.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1061" target="_blank">00:17:41.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And two out of three agents got stuck and never recovered.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1066" target="_blank">00:17:46.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And they got stuck in different places.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1069" target="_blank">00:17:49.620</a></span> | <span class="t">One of them got stuck because they ran a tool which brought up the prompt and they just didn't figure out and didn't kill it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1076" target="_blank">00:17:56.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And the other one got stuck because it made an HTTP request seemingly that got stuck somehow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1083" target="_blank">00:18:03.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And it didn't recover from that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1085" target="_blank">00:18:05.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And I could see that it was doing that because there was no tool usage being,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1089" target="_blank">00:18:09.620</a></span> | <span class="t">or I was assuming it was doing this because there was no tool usage at that time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1093" target="_blank">00:18:13.620</a></span> | <span class="t">It was effectively an inference step and the token counter did not increase anymore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1099" target="_blank">00:18:19.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was just stuck there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1101" target="_blank">00:18:21.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was either because the response that it got back from the server let it locally get stuck in a loop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1110" target="_blank">00:18:30.620</a></span> | <span class="t">But my point here is that there are some tools which have been already battle tested for autonomous use for extended period of time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1122" target="_blank">00:18:42.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And some of which haven't, even though they might be using the exact same underlying model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1130" target="_blank">00:18:50.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this really puts us in this really unfortunate situation where it is, even with the same model, very hard to evaluate the quality of an agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1143" target="_blank">00:19:03.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And seemingly, I think to me, it has become harder.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1148" target="_blank">00:19:08.620</a></span> | <span class="t">If you look at Sweebench, for instance, or things like this, you will get a bunch of numbers, but they don't necessarily tell you everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1156" target="_blank">00:19:16.620</a></span> | <span class="t">There are too many different workloads that we're throwing at these things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1160" target="_blank">00:19:20.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And there also seems to be some form of benchmark manipulation going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1166" target="_blank">00:19:26.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think this is necessarily nefarious.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1170" target="_blank">00:19:30.620</a></span> | <span class="t">This might just be an accidental benchmark optimization by just running it in a Sweebench and see how it's doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1176" target="_blank">00:19:36.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And if those tests don't change all that much, then maybe just optimize towards that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1181" target="_blank">00:19:41.620</a></span> | <span class="t">But for instance, when GPT-5 launched, it looked very appealing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1189" target="_blank">00:19:49.620</a></span> | <span class="t">It's very appealing and it probably is very appealing that it is significantly cheaper than the Antropic models are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1196" target="_blank">00:19:56.620</a></span> | <span class="t">The problem today is that if I just compare their official CLI or cursor with cloud code, I noticed that it uses many more tokens and many more turns.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1211" target="_blank">00:20:11.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Some of the savings that you get from the cheaper per token costs are negated by less efficient agentic loops.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1222" target="_blank">00:20:22.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And even inference and turns doesn't necessarily tell you how long it's going to take.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1228" target="_blank">00:20:28.620</a></span> | <span class="t">because there are also other things that influence the overall speed that it takes you to get a good result.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1238" target="_blank">00:20:38.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So there is actually some benefit to one-shotting a good result because you are less likely to go into iteration, which might be slow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1249" target="_blank">00:20:49.620</a></span> | <span class="t">On the other hand, if you are making iterative improvements and you also run the right tools all the time afterwards,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1265" target="_blank">00:21:05.620</a></span> | <span class="t">sometimes that can actually result in a better code quality overall.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1270" target="_blank">00:21:10.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that Sonnet loves to write wrong code, but because it is also rather eager to run the tools,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1277" target="_blank">00:21:17.620</a></span> | <span class="t">it overall results in better looking code quicker than you would achieve that same result right now in some versions of GPT-5.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1289" target="_blank">00:21:29.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And some agents are at least functionally capable of parallelization, even though that is not necessarily always possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1303" target="_blank">00:21:43.620</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's so many different ways in which these models can and these agents can behave differently.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1309" target="_blank">00:21:49.620</a></span> | <span class="t">That's very, very hard to evaluate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1311" target="_blank">00:21:51.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And I just generally want to caution everybody on a lot of takes that you can get on Twitter and elsewhere because it is really, really hard to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1324" target="_blank">00:22:04.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I think at least, it is really hard to get a good sense of what works and doesn't work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1330" target="_blank">00:22:10.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And I also noticed that in many ways what prevents me from using a tool today is actually not necessarily the quality of the code that it writes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1337" target="_blank">00:22:17.620</a></span> | <span class="t">or the quality of the inference, but really annoying things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1340" target="_blank">00:22:20.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So for instance, one of the agents that I actually think I would like quite a lot, I don't enjoy the user interface of.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1350" target="_blank">00:22:30.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I'm less likely to use that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1352" target="_blank">00:22:32.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Another person might have a different opinion on it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1355" target="_blank">00:22:35.620</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's so many different kind of things that influence how you interact with a tool that it can also then compromise the results that you're going to get.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1366" target="_blank">00:22:46.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So it is very hard to evaluate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1369" target="_blank">00:22:49.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that a lot of people are attached to one of the tools that they're using, particularly if you already start paying for it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1378" target="_blank">00:22:58.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And I do think it's important for us to get some better sentiment of evaluating this, in particular also because I think it's unsustainable to have that many tools that we'll have to consolidate down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1393" target="_blank">00:23:13.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And the way we're evaluating sometimes is just really kind of wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1398" target="_blank">00:23:18.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Particularly, I think in the last two weeks there was a lot of discussion about like who has the nicest looking terminal UI or the best performing terminal UI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1408" target="_blank">00:23:28.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I also don't like how the terminal renderer of most of those tools chitters around and is annoying.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1418" target="_blank">00:23:38.620</a></span> | <span class="t">At the same time, that's not the most pressing issue that I have with an authentic coding tool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1424" target="_blank">00:23:44.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And I also think that long term, the terminal UI is not where we want to end up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1429" target="_blank">00:23:49.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So there are many ways to evaluate it, but really what we should be evaluating on is like how good is it day to day in solving the problems that we're throwing at these tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1439" target="_blank">00:23:59.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And I don't think we're doing a particularly good job right now, or at least in general, I find Twitter to be a horrible source of high signal information on that topic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1453" target="_blank">00:24:13.620</a></span> | <span class="t">For evaluating models, I think it's even harder because there's so many trade offs on it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1459" target="_blank">00:24:19.620</a></span> | <span class="t">At the moment, I think there are basically a handful of models that are capable of doing this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1465" target="_blank">00:24:25.620</a></span> | <span class="t">The most significant ones are, of course, the entropic models, Opus and Sonnet, GPT-5.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1472" target="_blank">00:24:32.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Actually, there's also Gemini in there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1474" target="_blank">00:24:34.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I kind of forgot about this, but I think GPT-5 and Gemini are both fantastic models for code generation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1482" target="_blank">00:24:42.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Gemini didn't perform particularly great for tool usage, some of which can be compensated by the tool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1491" target="_blank">00:24:51.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So Gemini CLI, for instance, got quite a bit better recently by just recovering better from bad tool usage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1500" target="_blank">00:25:00.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I think with GPT-5, it's a little bit too early to say, but it looks from the initial feedback on people that got it already for two weeks or so that it's pretty capable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1513" target="_blank">00:25:13.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there's a growing number of open weights models that are at least capable of tool calls.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1521" target="_blank">00:25:21.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think they are very interesting for all kinds of different reasons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1524" target="_blank">00:25:24.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So for instance, Quen3Coder, I don't know if it has been trained on any particular tool, but seemingly it is at least quite a capable tool caller.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1539" target="_blank">00:25:39.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I think this is very interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1541" target="_blank">00:25:41.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Kimi is also a seemingly capable tool caller.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1547" target="_blank">00:25:47.620</a></span> | <span class="t">There's also the GLM model, which I haven't tried yet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1550" target="_blank">00:25:50.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Many of these models, though, the open weight ones come in very different sizes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1554" target="_blank">00:25:54.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you go to open router, you can pick different ones.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1558" target="_blank">00:25:58.620</a></span> | <span class="t">If you run them locally, they can run through different systems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1561" target="_blank">00:26:01.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Like there's a pretty significant difference in behavior sometimes between LM Studio and OLAMA.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1567" target="_blank">00:26:07.620</a></span> | <span class="t">On open router, it's almost a slot machine about if that model comes as advertised or not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1575" target="_blank">00:26:15.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I forgot for which model it was.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1580" target="_blank">00:26:20.620</a></span> | <span class="t">It might have been GPT-OSS where people reported a wildly different measured performance difference for tool calling reliability between the different providers on open router.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1590" target="_blank">00:26:30.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And it also looked like the initial source release of the Harmony new token system, whatever you want to call this, had some bugs that people walked around in different ways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1605" target="_blank">00:26:45.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So all of this makes it just so much harder to evaluate this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1610" target="_blank">00:26:50.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And I want to reiterate this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1612" target="_blank">00:26:52.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's very hard to estimate the costs right now because just because a token is cheaper doesn't mean that you're going to be cheaper off than with another one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1624" target="_blank">00:27:04.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And also, I think I didn't write this here, but I think another way of also estimating this is there was a lot of excitement in the first couple of days for Cerebus and Grok that they are going to be dramatically faster for these agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1639" target="_blank">00:27:19.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So for instance, but the challenge is that it doesn't seem like that is a consistent experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1644" target="_blank">00:27:24.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And in some cases, just being faster doesn't help you if you're also worse or that inference is necessarily the most expensive piece here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1655" target="_blank">00:27:35.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So for instance, pure throughput in some cases is higher on some hosting platforms, but time to first token is also higher, which in many cases compensates a lot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1667" target="_blank">00:27:47.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So it is really, really, really hard to evaluate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1670" target="_blank">00:27:50.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I just want to point this out once again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1672" target="_blank">00:27:52.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I have no idea how to do this better yet, but many of the benchmarks are kind of misleading.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1679" target="_blank">00:27:59.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think we need to just share a little bit the practical results and experience that we have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1684" target="_blank">00:28:04.620</a></span> | <span class="t">This is basically just why is everything so crazy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1691" target="_blank">00:28:11.620</a></span> | <span class="t">It's very clear that there is something really cool here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1695" target="_blank">00:28:15.620</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a lot of value being possible with these models, particularly if the agent and tool combination works out really well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1707" target="_blank">00:28:27.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I think almost everybody can use one of the agents to build another agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1714" target="_blank">00:28:34.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's only going to be more for a little while on these just because it's so much fun to build them to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1720" target="_blank">00:28:40.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's kind of shocking how many people raise money right now on more coding agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1725" target="_blank">00:28:45.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't understand the motivation here, but it doesn't stop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1731" target="_blank">00:28:51.620</a></span> | <span class="t">There's so many more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1732" target="_blank">00:28:52.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And because we haven't found a good way to evaluate them, I think it's also very hard to evaluate the quality of an agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1739" target="_blank">00:28:59.620</a></span> | <span

value out of a $200 subscription.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1830" target="_blank">00:30:30.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So there is some pressure coming in right now to put higher rate limits up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1837" target="_blank">00:30:37.620</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you look into how could you get tokens cheaper, you will discover that it's not possible for you to come to those token pricing through self-hosting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1850" target="_blank">00:30:50.620</a></span> | <span class="t">There are H100s, H200s, B200s, whatever they are called on the Internet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1855" target="_blank">00:30:55.620</a></span> | <span class="t">You can rent them for a couple of hours.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1857" target="_blank">00:30:57.620</a></span> | <span class="t">You can rent them for longer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1858" target="_blank">00:30:58.620</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you want to end up with a self-hosted open weights model, it is going to be more expensive than if you buy those minutes on open router.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1868" target="_blank">00:31:08.620</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the situation that we find ourselves in today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1871" target="_blank">00:31:11.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And your experience is also not necessarily going to work all that well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1876" target="_blank">00:31:16.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Even some of the open weights models require a lot of hacks for you to self-host them reliably.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1882" target="_blank">00:31:22.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And that might also explain why some of the model providers that you can find on open router for the same model have worse performance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1891" target="_blank">00:31:31.620</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a lot of stuff in the stack.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1893" target="_blank">00:31:33.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So for instance, when GPT-OSS launched, there were a bunch of bugs filed against open code and other tools that the responses coming from GPT-OSS were wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1904" target="_blank">00:31:44.620</a></span> | <span class="t">But it was actually a bug or a slash limitation in the underlying O, LAMA, and LM Studio where that issue appeared.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1915" target="_blank">00:31:55.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And so fixing that problem in open code would not be correct because the transformation should happen one layer down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1923" target="_blank">00:32:03.620</a></span> | <span class="t">But at the same time, as I have already seen, some fixes landing in some of the coding tools specifically for that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1930" target="_blank">00:32:10.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's kind of tricky to say where this goes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1939" target="_blank">00:32:19.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I think right now there's only limited motivation for people to get these open models running.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1946" target="_blank">00:32:26.620</a></span> | <span class="t">But some people are trying, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1948" target="_blank">00:32:28.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And so maybe as the cost might go down, there might be more people trying it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1953" target="_blank">00:32:33.620</a></span> | <span class="t">There might be better tooling around it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1955" target="_blank">00:32:35.620</a></span> | <span class="t">You might actually get to the point where maybe 10 people can share to H200 and get a recent experience out of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1961" target="_blank">00:32:41.620</a></span> | <span class="t">But we're not there today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1963" target="_blank">00:32:43.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And even more so locally running models, I think it's just going to have a really bad time with them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1971" target="_blank">00:32:51.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I try regularly to see how far they get.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1974" target="_blank">00:32:54.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And GPT-OSS and a bunch of other sequence recoder, the smaller variant, they're definitely capable of running, but they give up early.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1985" target="_blank">00:33:05.620</a></span> | <span class="t">They sometimes call the wrong tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1988" target="_blank">00:33:08.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I haven't found a good agent decoding tool that is really tweaked for them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1994" target="_blank">00:33:14.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's just too early right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=1997" target="_blank">00:33:17.620</a></span> | <span class="t">But I would just generally say, unless you're really motivated to try this, there's not much of a point in doing that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=2004" target="_blank">00:33:24.620</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a price pressure per token that's visible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=2009" target="_blank">00:33:29.620</a></span> | <span class="t">GPT-5 launched for a lower token price than the Antropic models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=2013" target="_blank">00:33:33.620</a></span> | <span class="t">But overall, we are using many more tokens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=2016" target="_blank">00:33:36.620</a></span> | <span class="t">The problems that we are throwing at these agents, they are still largely constrained by how much we can throw into the context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=2023" target="_blank">00:33:43.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And so for quite a while longer, the number of tokens we're going to throw at these are going to go up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=2030" target="_blank">00:33:50.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And so as a result, I just generally expect that the cost will go up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=2035" target="_blank">00:33:55.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's all I have at the moment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=2037" target="_blank">00:33:57.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So I have absolutely no recommendations of which agents you should be using.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=2040" target="_blank">00:34:00.620</a></span> | <span class="t">But I just want to share a little bit what I've learned on this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=2044" target="_blank">00:34:04.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And I encourage everybody to share their experiences, their genuine experiences, not their quick takes on Twitter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=2054" target="_blank">00:34:14.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Like write blog posts, like long form content, share what you really did with it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=2060" target="_blank">00:34:20.620</a></span> | <span class="t">That is so much more valuable than any quick tweet that has a face blown emoji or something like this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=2072" target="_blank">00:34:32.620</a></span> | <span class="t">We don't need more of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=2074" target="_blank">00:34:34.620</a></span> | <span class="t">That's already, we have enough of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=2076" target="_blank">00:34:36.620</a></span> | <span class="t">But what we need is genuine experiences with these tools and some consolidation to fewer of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=2083" target="_blank">00:34:43.620</a></span> | <span class="t">That is just too much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=2086" target="_blank">00:34:46.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfm99Tb7CNo&t=2087" target="_blank">00:34:47.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So thank you for listening.</span></div><div

another.</span></div></div></body></html>
