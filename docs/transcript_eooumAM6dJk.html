Not less. >>Good. You might have undervalued it. >>Or not even that. You say in the book that intelligence has convex returns and it matters especially for areas like inventors. >>Right. >>Then you also say that if you look at some of the most important things in society, something like what Larry and Sergey did, they're basically inventors, right?</p><p>So many of the most important things in society, intelligence matters more. And not only that, it has increasing returns. And it seems like with emergent ventures or a venture like that, you're trying to pick the people who are at the tail, right? You're not looking for a barista at Starbucks.</p><p>>>Sure. Awesome. >>So it seems like you should care about intelligence more given the evidence there. >>More than who does? I mean, there's a lot of jobs that I actually hire for in actual life where smarts are not the main thing I look for. Most jobs. I think the convexity of returns to intelligence is embedded in a multiplicative model where the IQ returns only cash out for people good at all these other things.</p></div></div></body></html>
