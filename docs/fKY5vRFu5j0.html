Well, why don't we say it? And we need reason. So here's some of my thoughts about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKY5vRFu5j0&t=56" target="_blank">00:00:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">language. First, there's a whole category of the misuse of important realities. I'm thinking God,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKY5vRFu5j0&t=69" target="_blank">00:01:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Jesus Christ, damn, and hell. Let's take those four. I think the Bible is pretty clear and pretty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKY5vRFu5j0&t=80" target="_blank">00:01:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">explicit when it says don't take the name of the Lord in vain, that God as a throwaway word,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKY5vRFu5j0&t=87" target="_blank">00:01:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">or Jesus Christ as a word of "I just hit my finger," or "something just terrible happened," or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKY5vRFu5j0&t=96" target="_blank">00:01:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">"damn" as a swear word, or "hell" as a throwaway swear word. The problem with all those is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKY5vRFu5j0&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">they take things that are unbelievably important, serious, and they turn them into moments of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKY5vRFu5j0&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">smallness. There's a disconnect. There's a lack of coherence and harmony between the way they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKY5vRFu5j0&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.200</a></span> | <span class="t">being used and the weight that they should carry. If a person uses God and Jesus Christ and damn</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKY5vRFu5j0&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and hell as a throwaway standard expression of irritation or anger, he is belittling God,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKY5vRFu5j0&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">belittling Christ, belittling the serious of damnation, and belittling hell, and we ought not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKY5vRFu5j0&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">to belittle these big, big things. So that's my first take. Second, there's a whole category in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKY5vRFu5j0&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the Bible and in English language called crude, crass, vulgar, indecent. Those words didn't come</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKY5vRFu5j0&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">out of nowhere. Those words are invented because human beings in every culture have felt certain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKY5vRFu5j0&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">things are inappropriate. Every culture has something that they view as offensive, or we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKY5vRFu5j0&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">have this word "off-color," or we have the word "rude." Now a person might ask, "Well, is there a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKY5vRFu5j0&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">biblical category for that stuff?" And the answer is a resounding "yes." I was talking about this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKY5vRFu5j0&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">just the other day, maybe two weeks ago, a week and a half ago, with the guys over at Bethlehem</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKY5vRFu5j0&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Seminary about the category of this kind of ethics, and here's a couple of texts. In 1 Corinthians 13,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKY5vRFu5j0&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">"Love is patient and kind. Love does not envy or boast. It is not arrogant or rude."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKY5vRFu5j0&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Rude. Now, "rude" is in the King James translated, "does not behave itself unseemly."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKY5vRFu5j0&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Now that word "unseemly," that's an old-fashioned word. Hardly anybody uses it today,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKY5vRFu5j0&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">but we all know what that means. There are things that are inappropriate. They're dishonorable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKY5vRFu5j0&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.560</a></span> | <span class="t">They're disgraceful. They're indecent. So the Bible says, "Be aware in the culture where you are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKY5vRFu5j0&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.720</a></span> | <span class="t">not to offend unnecessarily against what is broadly considered rude." Or here's another one,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKY5vRFu5j0&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Ephesians 5, 4, "Let there be no filthiness, nor foolish talk, nor crude joking, which are,"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKY5vRFu5j0&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and then you get this phrase, "out of place," "unfitting." The Greek is "anakin," but instead,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKY5vRFu5j0&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">"Let there be thanksgiving." So Paul knew that there were a hundred decisions you'd have to make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKY5vRFu5j0&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">in life for which you couldn't consult a list. There's no list that's going to work for when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKY5vRFu5j0&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">something is inappropriately crude, or foolish talk, or filthiness. And so he's saying, "But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKY5vRFu5j0&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">there is a category, and Christians should not want their language to be crossing over those lines</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKY5vRFu5j0&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">again and again." And right there at the end of that verse is a third thought. So the first thought</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKY5vRFu5j0&t=302" target="_blank">00:05:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">was taking big, weighty, glorious things and belittling them, and speaking as though they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKY5vRFu5j0&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">weren't important. And the second thought is there's a biblical category for unseemliness,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKY5vRFu5j0&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and inappropriateness, and rude, and crude, and foolish, and filthy, and Christians ought not to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKY5vRFu5j0&t=319" target="_blank">00:05:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">want that. Here's a third idea. At the end of that verse there that I quoted from Ephesians 5, it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKY5vRFu5j0&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">says, "But instead, let there be thanksgiving," which I think means that Paul thought if your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKY5vRFu5j0&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">heart is right and brimming with gratitude to God in all things, that will be a monitor on the kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKY5vRFu5j0&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">of crudeness that comes out of your mouth. People that tend to use a lot of four-letter words, a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKY5vRFu5j0&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">of scatological talk, a lot of harsh, crude, rough, crass talk, are generally sounding pretty angry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKY5vRFu5j0&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">They're not content. They're not happy in Jesus. Something's out of whack in their heart. So I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKY5vRFu5j0&t=371" target="_blank">00:06:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">think a third major issue is, is your heart right? Are these things coming out of a good heart?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKY5vRFu5j0&t=379" target="_blank">00:06:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Which leads to one last comment. What is it? Ephesians 4, verse 29, "Let no corrupting talk,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKY5vRFu5j0&t=387" target="_blank">00:06:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">no foul talk, come out of your mouths, but only what is good for building up, as fits the occasion,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKY5vRFu5j0&t=396" target="_blank">00:06:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that it may give grace to those who hear." So here you have Paul explicitly moving beyond</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKY5vRFu5j0&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">gratitude in my heart, which I think is going to wash away most of the crude stuff, but he's saying,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKY5vRFu5j0&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">"Let your language always be good for people." And what he means by good for people is minister</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKY5vRFu5j0&t=418" target="_blank">00:06:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">grace for them. So you should ask, if you're about to say some four-letter word, or for some harsh and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKY5vRFu5j0&t=425" target="_blank">00:07:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">ugly thing that's kind of dirty, is it going to be good for people? Is it going to build them up? Is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKY5vRFu5j0&t=431" target="_blank">00:07:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">it going to make them stronger? Is it going to make Christ more beautiful in their eyes? So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKY5vRFu5j0&t=437" target="_blank">00:07:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">those are general thoughts. Let me see if I can sum them up. Let me try. One, don't debase and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKY5vRFu5j0&t=444" target="_blank">00:07:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">cheapen great reality. Number two, does it come under the category of culturally recognized,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKY5vRFu5j0&t=452" target="_blank">00:07:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">crude, off-color, vulgar, offensive? Three, does it reveal a bitter, overly angry, dissatisfied</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKY5vRFu5j0&t=461" target="_blank">00:07:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">rather than thankful heart? And four, does it minister grace to those who hear? We live—you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKY5vRFu5j0&t=469" target="_blank">00:07:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">and I both, Tony, know we cherish Christ and the gospel above all, and that should mean that grace</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKY5vRFu5j0&t=477" target="_blank">00:07:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">is abounding in our hearts, and most of the language that is offensive and questionable</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKY5vRFu5j0&t=483" target="_blank">00:08:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">is simply contrary to ministering grace and living out of grace.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKY5vRFu5j0&t=487" target="_blank">00:08:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for listening to this podcast.
