what we're going to be looking at is a code first approach</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=15" target="_blank">00:00:15.260</a></span>

target="_blank">00:00:20.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So before we get started, we should probably talk about what is a language model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=25" target="_blank">00:00:25.940</a></span> | <span class="t">I would say that this is going to make more sense if you know the kind of basics of

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">source ones and open AI-based ones.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=82" target="_blank">00:01:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's all going to be based using code as much as possible.</span></div><div

is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And so as you might have heard before, a language model is something that knows how to predict</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=96" target="_blank">00:01:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the next word of a sentence or knows how to fill in the missing words of a sentence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=102" target="_blank">00:01:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And we can look at an example of one, open AI has a language model, text DaVinci003,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=109" target="_blank">00:01:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and we can play with it by passing in some words and ask it to predict what the next</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.360</a></span>

we pass in, "When I arrived back at the panda breeding facility after the extraordinary</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.440</a></span> | <span class="t">reign of live frogs, I couldn't believe what I saw."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

next.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So kind of fun for creative brainstorming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.420</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a nice site called Nat.dev.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Nat.dev lets us play with a variety of language models, and here I've selected text DaVinci003,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and I'll hit submit, and it starts printing stuff out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">The pandas were happily playing and eating the frogs that had fallen from the sky.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.520</a></span> | <span class="t">It was an amazing sight to see these animals taking advantage of such unique opportunity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=157"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.880</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what happened after the extraordinary reign of live frogs at the panda

which is a thing in Nat.dev where it shows,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.640</a></span> | <span

pretty likely the next word here is going to be "the," and after "the," since we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">talking about a panda breeding facility, it's going to be "panda's were," and what were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.360</a></span> | <span class="t">they doing?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, they could have been doing a few things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They could have been doing something happily, or the pandas were having, the pandas were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">out, the pandas were playing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So it picked the most likely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It thought it was 20% likely it's going to be happily, and what were they happily doing?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Could have been playing, hopping, eating, and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So they're eating the frogs that, and then had almost certainly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can see what it's doing at each point is it's predicting the probability of a variety</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.880</a></span> | <span class="t">of possible next words.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And depending on how you set it up, it will either pick the most likely one every time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">or you can change, muck around with things like p-values and temperatures to change what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">comes up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So at each time, then it'll give us a different result, and this is kind of fun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Frogs perched on the heads of some of the pandas, it was an amazing sight, et cetera,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.840</a></span> | <span class="t">et cetera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's what a language model does.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Now you might notice here it hasn't predicted pandas, it's predicted panned.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And then separately, us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay after panned it's going to be us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's not always a whole word.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Here it's an, and then harmed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, actually it's an, ha, mud.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can see that it's not always predicting words, specifically what it's doing is predicting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">tokens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Tokens are either whole words or subword units, pieces of a word, or it could even be punctuation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.440</a></span> | <span class="t">or numbers or so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's have a look at how that works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=302" target="_blank">00:05:02.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So for example, we can use the actual, it's called tokenization to create tokens from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.080</a></span> | <span class="t">a string.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.680</a></span> | <span class="t">We can use the same tokenizer that GPT uses by using tick token, and we can specifically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">say we want to use the same tokenizer that that model text eventually 003 uses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

splashing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=328" target="_blank">00:05:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I thought, well, we'll encode they are splashing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And the result is a bunch of numbers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And what those numbers are, they're basically just lookups into a vocabulary that OpenAI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=341"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And if I then decode those, it says, oh, these numbers are they space are space

together, they are splashing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So you

target="_blank">00:07:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So for example, from the Wikipedia article for the birds, the birds is a 1963 American</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

to guess what the next word is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=490" target="_blank">00:08:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And if

that there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU&t=4778" target="_blank">01:19:38.280</a></span> | <span class="t">no context here being

target="_blank">01:20:56.360</a></span> | <span class="t">do our own fine tuning and fine tuning is cool because rather than just retrieving documents</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
