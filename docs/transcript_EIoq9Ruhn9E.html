Of course they don't. But that's not the main thing they learn. They learn some vision of how the world works, how they fit into it, that they ought to have higher aspirations, that they can join the upper middle class, that they're supposed to have a particular kind of job.</p><p>Here are the kinds of jerks you're going to meet along the way. Here's some sense of how dating markets work. Maybe you're in a fraternity. Maybe you do a sport and so on. That's what you learn. How did you spot Brian? He was maybe in high school even when I met him, and I think he made a point of seeking me out.</p><p>I immediately thought, "Well, this guy's going to be something. Got to keep track of this guy." Say more. What happened? His level of enthusiasm, ability to speak with respect to detail, and just bursting with everything was immediately evident, as it still is. Brian has changed less than almost anyone else I know over what is now.</p><p>He could tell you how many years, but a whole bunch of decades.</p></div></div></body></html>
