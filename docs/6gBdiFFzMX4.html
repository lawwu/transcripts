So we're already all saying no, even if we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">don't realize that we just do it somewhat haphazardly. And I wrote a New Yorker piece</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">about this last fall where I said my theory about how most people informally handle the goal of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">saying no, they don't have a plan, they don't have an intention, they don't have a vision for what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=118" target="_blank">00:01:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">they're trying to accomplish. They instead wait until their level of experience stress</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=124" target="_blank">00:02:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">is high enough that they feel emotionally justified turning someone down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's like I am so overwhelmed right now, I feel justified saying no. And until that point,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't. And what I argued in that New Yorker piece is that this is a terrible way to go about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">this because it ensures that you remain at a persistent level of elevated stress. If you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">to be sufficiently stressed to feel comfortable saying no, then you're never gonna start saying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">no until you're sufficiently stressed. So you're gonna stay at this level of being sufficiently</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">stressed, basically persistently. So when we are not intentional about how we filter what we do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and don't do, we end up in this default purgatory, this productivity purgatory of having just a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">enough just enough on our plate that it is bearable, but uncomfortable. And we persist there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So we burn out and don't produce what we want and all the other negatives to come. So what we need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.520</a></span> | <span class="t">to do is be more specific with ourselves about how we figure out what's a reasonable workload,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">what that workload should be made up of how we're going to go about dealing with requests to fit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">that load and not overload. We need to be more specific about it. That's why I was happy to see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">an article that someone sent to me, an alert listener sent to me, that appeared in a it's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">column in the journal Nature. And it is written by four scientists. And it is titled, "Why Four</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Scientists Spent a Year Saying No" and it is an article that gets into the tactical weeds about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the challenges and proper strategies for declining or turning away stuff that's going to overload</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">you, turning away work. So I want to go through this article because I often harp about this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.680</a></span> | <span class="t">"Hey, you got to be more intentional about how you say yes or no," but we don't necessarily get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">into enough tactics about, "Well, how do I actually say no without feeling really bad</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">or annoying people?" All right, so I have the article here. So those who are watching on YouTube,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">so you can find this at youtube.com/CalNewportMedia. You'll see on the screen that we have the date</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">highlighted. This is from August 25th, so this is recent. Now the four scientists who wrote this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">column, their names don't show up in this version I have here, but probably relevant to this article,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I believe all four are women. So that'll come up a little bit later. All right, so I want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">highlight a couple things here. First, just to start, let's give the premise for what they were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">doing here before we get to their specific advice. So the premise is the following. "Last May," I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">quoting the article here, "Last May, facing pandemic and career burnout, this member whimsically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">suggested," so member of these four scientists have a group that meets regularly to discuss just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">their career and the challenges of being scientists. All right, so back to the quote, "A member of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">group whimsically suggested we make a game out of saying no by challenging ourselves to collectively</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">decline 100 work-related requests. Thus, we spent a year tracking and reflecting on our decisions to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">say no." So they started in May of 2021, they finished in March of 2022. So they got systematic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=322" target="_blank">00:05:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">about saying no and had four observations. They call them here four insights about what they learned</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">saying no systematically 100 times over the course of a year. So let's go through these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">four insights real quick. All right, the first insight, "Tracking helped make no an option."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So they started keeping track of all the things they said yes or no to, just a simple list. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=347" target="_blank">00:05:47.120</a></span> | <span class="t">this is separate from whatever other organizational system you have for organizing your time or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">projects. Let's just have a yes/no list. So as they pointed out, first of all, it helped them understand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=356" target="_blank">00:05:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">how much they'd already said yes. It's easy to forget. It also induced the gamification</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">motivation of, well, how many no's do we have? I want to get a couple more no's this week. Maybe I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">do want to say no. What they then talked about is that once they started tracking no,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=374" target="_blank">00:06:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">this got them in the tracking mindset, which helped them in other ways as well.

So when they were reflecting,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=442" target="_blank">00:07:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">they said, "We declined too many little things, such as reviewing journal articles, and not enough</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=449" target="_blank">00:07:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">big tasks." I think that's a good point. They were saying, you can rack up the no's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=458" target="_blank">00:07:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">quicker if you're aiming on the little things, the things that might take you a couple hours</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=462" target="_blank">00:07:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">of the afternoons, but they're noting the things that caused the most stress were the big asks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=466" target="_blank">00:07:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And they give some examples here, leadership opportunities, the chance to help write large</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=473" target="_blank">00:07:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">grant proposals, et cetera.

Jesse knows this. Okay, so what they ended up doing is coming up with a series of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=486" target="_blank">00:08:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">questions to help evaluate when to say yes and when not. So here's their questions. They have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=495" target="_blank">00:08:15.600</a></span> | <span class="t">five of them. This is what they started asking to try to figure out, okay, is this something I should</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=499" target="_blank">00:08:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">say yes to?

Two, does it spark joy?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=504" target="_blank">00:08:24.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Three, do I have time to do a good job without sacrificing extra commitments? Four, does the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">opportunity leave space for my personal life?

So when something big would come along, they would say, look, there's two of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=524" target="_blank">00:08:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">these criteria, it doesn't pass. So now I have a reason to say no. Three, and this is an important</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=533" target="_blank">00:08:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">one, maybe sometimes overlooked, saying no is emotional work. It really is. I have to say no a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=544" target="_blank">00:09:04.640</a></span> | <span class="t">lot. I just earlier this week got out, you know, said no to a speaking thing that I sort of went</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=551" target="_blank">00:09:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">down the road with it because I thought it would be interesting, but it logistically was going to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=555" target="_blank">00:09:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">a pain. I knew I would regret it later on. And it's hard. And sometimes the other people get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=561" target="_blank">00:09:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">upset. I would say nine times out of 10 people aren't really upset. They just need an answer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=565" target="_blank">00:09:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and they're moving on.

So I think that's a good point they're pointing out. Um, so what they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=680" target="_blank">00:11:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">say here is we need less logistical advice and more emotional advice when it comes to thinking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=685" target="_blank">00:11:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">about yes or no. So let's acknowledge that. I think that's a very important point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=688" target="_blank">00:11:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. In the same piece, they pulled out. I want, there's one other thing I want to highlight</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=694" target="_blank">00:11:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">in the same section here.

Soft no or little no.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=703" target="_blank">00:11:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So they had heard something called little no, which is where like you agree to a little bit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=707" target="_blank">00:11:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">or to do a lesser thing. So it's not as emotionally taxing. And they described that strategy,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=712" target="_blank">00:11:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">that strategy for reducing the emotional toll of saying no to be a slippery slope that led people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=719" target="_blank">00:11:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">to ask for a greater commitment.

You owe them and yourself clarity. So that's, you have to have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=781" target="_blank">00:13:01.200</a></span> | <span class="t">in there somewhere. I've definitely learned this specifically. I am saying no period. And then you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=786" target="_blank">00:13:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">can add regrets and stuff like that. That's fine, but don't give any wiggle room. The other thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=792" target="_blank">00:13:12.720</a></span> | <span class="t">to say is don't say, well, I'm really busy right now. So I don't think I can do it this semester</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=797" target="_blank">00:13:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">or this month because they will be like, great. How about January? So it has to be because of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gBdiFFzMX4&t=803" target="_blank">00:13:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">busyness or because of whatever I have to say no.
