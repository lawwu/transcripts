Well, I feel like knowing the name of something,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84dYijIpWjQ&t=439" target="_blank">00:07:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">anterior mid-cingulate cortex, doesn't fundamentally change us.

But everybody, unless they're brain damaged, like a hole through their head,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84dYijIpWjQ&t=456" target="_blank">00:07:36.760</a></span> | <span class="t">has two anterior mid-cingulate cortex, one on each side of their brain. Everyone has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84dYijIpWjQ&t=461" target="_blank">00:07:41.880</a></span> | <span class="t">one. They have two. So I feel like it's just a question of opening the portal. And the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84dYijIpWjQ&t=469" target="_blank">00:07:49.160</a></span> | <span class="t">portal, what I, again, I'm just going to say 10 times and forgive me, is I think people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84dYijIpWjQ&t=473" target="_blank">00:07:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">go, "Oh, I do hard things.

I love training</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84dYijIpWjQ&t=478" target="_blank">00:07:58.560</a></span> | <span class="t">with weights.

I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84dYijIpWjQ&t=482" target="_blank">00:08:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">like four streps. So I'll tell you, they don't build my anterior mid-cingulate cortex because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84dYijIpWjQ&t=487" target="_blank">00:08:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I like to do it. Anything you like to do is not going to enhance this aspect of willpower.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84dYijIpWjQ&t=493" target="_blank">00:08:13.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And it seems so obvious once you hear it. You kind of go, "Oh, yeah, of course." But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84dYijIpWjQ&t=497" target="_blank">00:08:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I think you really close that loop for people when you share what you're sharing today and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84dYijIpWjQ&t=506" target="_blank">00:08:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">what you've shared elsewhere before as well when you're trying to explain the friction</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84dYijIpWjQ&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.160</a></span> | <span class="t">as the critical ingredient. And I think people think, "Oh, if it's effort, well, then I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84dYijIpWjQ&t=514" target="_blank">00:08:34.120</a></span> | <span class="t">getting better." That's part of it.

These</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84dYijIpWjQ&t=526" target="_blank">00:08:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">are probably the most unpleasant terms we've ever used on this podcast.
