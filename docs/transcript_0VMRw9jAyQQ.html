I think they need some structure but you have to let them rebel against it and do their own thing also.</p><p>Zero structure strikes me as great for a few of them but even for the super talented ones it's not perfect they need exposure to things and they need some teachers as role models so you want them to have some structure. And if you read old books about education there's a strong emphasis on moral instruction.</p><p>Do you think that needs to be an important part of education or is that just... I'd like to see more data but I suspect the best moral instruction is the teachers actually being good people and I think that works but again I'd like to see the data but that somehow you get up and lecture them about the seven virtues or something seems to me a waste of time and maybe even counterproductive</p></div></div></body></html>
