What are these financial instruments that we hear about so much? How do they work and why should you care? Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast for today, Wednesday, July 16, 2014. Thank you for being here. I've been looking forward to this topic. It's one of my favorite topics. It's basically to discuss and walk through the basics. The basics of stocks, bonds, and derivatives. To really establish a foundational knowledge of what these financial instruments are so that you can understand how to use them in your life to better your goals. A lot of times as a financial advisor, I would spend time working with clients and clients would ask me questions about their investments. Clients would ask me questions about their 401ks, about markets, or things like that. I always had this experience of trying to answer their questions directly. With clients who were very financially literate, I found that it was easy and fun to answer the question to have a discussion. I found that many clients did not have a high degree of comfort or literacy with the basic terms and the basic things that these words mean. When you talk about stocks or you hear about the stock market, there are different pictures that come to everyone's head. We want to understand what do these words actually mean so that we can have a real understanding of what they mean. We want to understand what they mean so that we can have a real understanding of what they mean. We want to understand what they mean so that we can have a real understanding of what they mean. really relevant idea of how to interpret the news, how to interpret what we read and what we learn about. So on today's show, I'm going to try to unpack and build a foundational knowledge of understanding about stocks and bonds. And so I hope you'll enjoy it, and I hope that it will be really valuable to you. I think I'll probably be able to give you some information today that will be very relevant to your life, whether that's your life as an investor in publicly traded securities or whether that's relevant to your life as an individual with just some ideas about how you can use stocks and bonds within your own business or as a wealth transfer mechanism or in other ways. So we'll talk about that today. I'm pretty excited about it. Before we do that, I just want to get into a couple of announcements, and I want to lead off with announcement number one, which is thank you. Thank you for listening. And I really mean this from the bottom of my heart. I'm so thrilled with some of the feedback and the response that I've been starting to get. On this show and some of the emails and the questions and the conversations that I'm having. I'm so, so thrilled with this. Yesterday was a record day for total number of downloads on the show. It was really, really a record day. And, you know, I don't remember if I've said this on the show or not. I don't think I have, but you may wonder why am I doing this show. And here's why I'm doing the show. To me, my doing this show is an answer to. My $10 million question. I did a previous episode back in the handheld voice recorder. The handheld voice recorder days. Hopefully you can get through the audio quality. And I talked about like, what do you want? And I said a good question that has served me well in my own journaling and my own ideas and understanding is that is to sit down and start with what do I want? What do I really want out of life? And so I, I, I find the $10 million question useful. And basically the idea is. Pretend you win $10 million income tax free in a lottery and you have now have 10 million bucks in the bank. And I assume then you go and you give some money away to the people that you want to give money away to. You buy some of the toys and the things that are on your list. And you take some of it for me. I take some trips or whatever the fun things are. Now fast forward a year and you wake up on Monday morning a year later after that $10 million windfall. And you still have plenty of the money, plenty of money in the bank. You can live it your lifestyle without ever having to go to work again the rest of your life. What would you do every day? And I really feel like that question should form the foundation of financial planning. What would you do every day? And no matter what you would do, there's probably a way to figure out how to do it now and skip the $10 million. I really feel like this just makes sense to me. And so in my answer to that question, if I did that, you know, as I try to think about it. Now I'm pretty young, so I don't really know for sure. And we won't know until we get to the $10 million. And I can say, yes, this is exactly what I would do. But I feel like my best answer so far. Is that if I had $10 million in the bank, I would get up on Monday morning. I would have a cup of coffee. I would eat breakfast with my family. I would go out to my nice office in a sunny window with a comfortable chair. I would probably read some books on topics that I'm interested in. Whether that's topics of investing or whether that's topics of finance. Whether that's topics of financial planning. Whether it's philosophy. Whether it's politics. I enjoy just thinking and talking with people. About these types of subjects. And I love to teach. So I get most. I feel really alive when I'm able to see the light bulb go off in somebody's eyes. That's why I love doing financial planning. Is that when I can explain something to someone in a way that makes sense. And I can just teach them about some ideas. That they can really see it. And I see that light bulb go off in their eyes. That just makes all of the impact in the world for me. It makes me feel really, really good. And it gives me a lot of joy and a lot of gratification. So. I don't have 10 million bucks. But when I look at it. And I look at the online world. And I see that we are sitting in a day and age. Where anybody can teach. If they're an expert in something. They can build a platform and teach others. Some of their knowledge. And share some of their knowledge. And some of their joy over things. And that's what I love to do. I love to learn. I love to consume. I love to just engage and grapple with ideas. And so. In today's world. I see lots of people able to do that. And I see lots of people able to do that. And earn a little bit of income off of it. The vast majority of people who are building and teaching. And doing things online. Don't make any money off of it. And they certainly don't make any kind of living wage. But there are some who do. And I believe that the people who are the best in the world. The best world class teachers. Those people are going to be able to establish themselves. In a really meaningful way. And be able to impact the lives of students. I'm so inspired by Salmat Khan. With what he did. He did at the Khan Academy. He just started teaching. And now he gets to spend all of his time teaching. And he's able to help millions and millions of people. All around the world. And that can be the same when very, very focused. Niche topics. Or it can be the same in huge topics. I'm so indebted. Last night I discovered a new podcast. Which I would commend to you. Called the Thomas Jefferson Podcast. And here's this guy. I think he's a college professor. I only listened to one episode. Or even the first half of an episode. He's a college professor. Up in Virginia. He's an expert on Thomas Jefferson. And he's recorded something like a hundred and some odd shows. About Thomas Jefferson. He has a show on public radio. And so it's kind of simulcast on the podcast. And on the show. I listened to 30 minutes of his show. And I was just blown away by how much I learned. And how much I gained. From the life of Thomas Jefferson. And what he did that made him truly a remarkable man. And so I want to do the same thing in the areas of finance. I've shared my dream. I want to see people. I want to get a letter someday. From some 18 or 20 year old young man or young woman. That says Joshua. I discovered your podcast when I was 15 years old. And over the last five years. With this information that I have received. I have been able to transform my life. In way A and way B and way C. I've been struggling to try to find out. What is the theme of the show. And the way that I. What I really see right now. That I'm trying to craft in a little bit better language. Is that the theme of this show. Is to help you cross the chasm. Between your goals. And your ideas. About your vision of a perfect ideal life. And where you are today. Because there's a lot of great stuff out there. A lot of great inspirational. Kind of fluffy goal setting. Visioning. Idealism. Go out and figure out what you want. There's a lot of awesome resources that are out there. But then you sit and say. Here I am. I've got to go to work. I've got to get in the car and sit in traffic. And what do I do about that? There are a series of very specific tangible steps. That can occur. To take you from here to there. But we've got to talk about those steps. And the void that I see in the marketplace. Is lots of people are talking about the inspirational ideas. And that is so valuable. To have the inspirational ideas. But we need a plan to get from where we are today. To there. It's inspirational to have the idea of getting out of debt. But we need a plan. To sit down and say. Well how much extra can we pay towards that debt this month. In order to get that started. So that's what I want this show to do. Is to serve as a conduit of great ideas. Both the inspiration. And the education. And the ideas. And then the specific tactics and strategies. That you can implement into your life. To really help you to make progress. That's the void that I see. The topic that's not being met in the marketplace. And so in order to do that. We've got to reach people. And so with this show. I'm just so thrilled. Yesterday I mentioned yesterday was a record day. And in case you're interested. I want to involve you in the show. So we've been going now. Since I launched on July 1. So we're about two weeks in. And yesterday we had 600 downloads. 596 downloads total of the show. And now in the world of podcasting. I don't actually know. What number matters. And I know that I have at least one or two listeners. And you one or two listeners. I'm really thrilled that you're here. And the ones that I've heard from. The ones that I've corresponded with. It just makes me feel really good. To know that I can share some ideas and concepts. That might be helpful with you. But I figure kind of the most meaningful statistic for me. With this being a daily show. Would be to look at and see how many. Downloads are done of a show in one day. So right now as of yesterday. We released the show yesterday. Episode 20 the interview. And since yesterday. There have been 210 downloads of that show. So I figure there's probably. You know almost a couple hundred of you. Listening to me at this point. Maybe a hundred or 150. And I just want to say thank you. Because the idea to me. It's so motivating to think of the idea. Of what a hundred or 150 of you. Sitting in a room would look like. And. It's really humbling with the idea. That I've got to come up with ideas. That are going to really help you. So thank you for listening. Thank you for those of you. Who are helping me spread the message of the show. And I want to read next to you. I want to just read some. Share some iTunes reviews with you. By the way. Just in case you hear it in the background. I'm in Florida. And as I record this. It's 1 46 p.m. And we are having our summer thunderstorm. So if you've never been to the subtropics. Generally during the summer. We have a rainstorm every afternoon. Early afternoon. And so it's thundering outside the window. And so welcome to. Welcome to Florida. Hope you enjoy your visit. Your virtual visit. So. So the way that we can reach more people. And I'm just so thrilled. Is. To help the show be found. And in case you're not familiar with this. Only as a podcast listener. The most important thing. To help the show be found. Is reviews. Because if you have reviews. And down. Downloads and reviews. If we can generate a certain number of downloads. And reviews. Then we can start to have people. Find the show. We'll start to show up in the directories. So if somebody searches. You know. Finance. Or somebody searches. Debt. Or someone searches investing. Or personal finance. Or whatever their search terms are. In iTunes. Or in pocket casts. Or Stitcher. Or whatever it is. The more. The more. Reviews that we have. The more likely it is. That we'll be higher in the search rankings. So the biggest help. And I just want to say thank you. The biggest thing that can be helpful to me. Is for you to review the show. That really helps people to find us. And it helps me hopefully. To be able to help more people. And for us to really grow this thing together. I want this show to serve you. So if you have questions. If you have topics that you want me to cover. I want this show to serve you. Leading off with. I want to. We have three reviews on iTunes right now. And I just want to say thank you. The first one is from the author. His name is Stevenomics. And this Stevenomics was actually a contributor to the show. He asked a question last Friday. And he has a website that I want to point you to. I was remiss in not pointing you to his website. When I answered his question on Friday's Q&A. But he said extremely informative. The best financial podcast out there. So glad he's back on the air. Thank you. That means the world to me. Steve. I really, really appreciate that. If you're interested. I want you to check out his website. He has a website called Stevenomics. It's S-T-E-V-E-O-N-O-M-I-C-S. That he writes. And he talks about. His tagline is where freedom and fashion meet finance. And it's really interesting. He actually. I found a post. And I just tweeted it out last week. He has a post on Huffington Post. He got an article written and published on Huffington Post. Called I spent just a thousand bucks. On my wedding. Here's how. And it's a really neat insight into his life. About how he and his wife were able to. He and his wife Sally. Were able to get married. And have a really fun. Really ideal wedding for them. And do it on a frugal. In a frugal way. And I feel like. That's such an amazing benefit. For people when they're getting married. And starting off. To be able to have the wedding of their dreams. Without a huge price tag. Another one. From Wolf M. In Germany. So this is on the German iTunes. Germany iTunes listing. His title says smart. He gave us a five star review. And he said an awesome. Non-dogmatic approach to finance. With some real gems. Where several layers of efficient concepts. Are stacked on top of each other. Really good to broaden one's own horizon. Daily shows please don't burn out. So Wolf. Thank you for the review. And yes. I'm thrilled with the message that I have. The non-dogmatic approach is getting out. And then the several layers of efficient concepts. And you're going to hear. As we get into the meat of today's show. How I see these concepts working together. Where in my mind. I think that it is. Every bit is valid. To compare the cost of. Investing in a stock. And through your. Your retirement plan at work. And I don't know. How the system works in Germany. So forgive me. Hopefully there'll be enough ideas here. But I see the analysis should be. When am I. Is it my better serve. To invest a hundred dollars. Into my retirement plan. And buy a publicly traded stock. Or am I better spent. To invest that hundred dollars. And buy a full stock. Or buy four fruit trees. For my front yard. That are going to spit out. Apples and apricots. If you're in Germany. Or down here in Florida. Mangoes and avocados. And things to feed my family. And lower my grocery bill. As time goes on. That's the analysis that's missing. And that is a valid analysis. And that's the analysis that's missing. In the personal finance world. You've got to understand. And look at these things. So I hope that every day. I can bring you concepts. And when I'm. My goal is to bring guests on. That are going to challenge you. That are going to inspire you. With ideas and ways. That they've solved. Their problems. So that you can get exposed. And then look at your own life. And say. Well how can I do. How can I do this. And he said. Daily shows. Please don't burn out. Thank you. I'm not going to burn out. I think with the. I've got some stuff burning inside me. I think I could do a thousand shows. On my own. No interviews. With just some of the concepts. That I think would be helpful. Without burning out. I love doing this. And I've got enough. Other income. And other things to. I've got enough other income. To fall back on. That I can do this. For quite a while. And I don't plan to go anywhere. And my hope is. I don't expect anyone. To listen to every show. But my hope is. That this can be. A real source of inspiration. And education for you. Every day. And I do hope. Over time. That the show could. Could generate some profit. That I would be able to live on. And support my family with. That is my ultimate hope. So. But it's clearly. Going to take a while. To do there. So I'm committed. To doing a thousand shows. No matter what. And if after a thousand shows. Then. Then we'll reconsider. But I'm not going to. I'm not going to quit. Before a thousand shows. And then the third review. Just came in this morning. As a four star review. From. Lisa Gabriela. Which. She says. Help me save money. It's so nice. To have a lower cell phone bill. Than my friends and parents. And still have all the same features. An interview on this podcast. Explained how to choose. The best plan for me. Twenty five bucks a month. On a smart phone. Yes please. So. Meat and potatoes. Versus. Versus. Meat and potatoes stuff. But man. That matters. That really does matter. On a daily basis. So. With that. I think that's good for. For. The announcements for today. I want to get into the meat of the show. Oh. If you have questions for Friday. Q and A. Email me your questions. Tweet me your questions. However you want to get a hold of me. Joshua. At Radical Personal Finance dot com. On Twitter. It's Radical PF. And pretty soon here. I'll have a voicemail line. Set up. That you can call in. As soon as I can get that done. And please. If you want to help me. Please tell one person about the show. And I would just be so thrilled. And so grateful. If you would. Leave a review for me. On iTunes. And again. One star. Five stars. Doesn't matter. Give me your honest feedback. And if you have a website. Or something like that. That you. That you wish to disclose. Let me know. And I'll make sure to. To comment on that. And share that with the. With the audience. And I'll be thrilled. As we build this thing together. Thank you for listening. All right. Into the meat of today's show. Today we're going to talk about. Stocks. And bonds. And derivatives. And basically. There are. There are three major classes. Of financial assets. And they're stocks. Bonds. And derivatives. And I'm going to. Cover mostly today. Stocks. And bonds. This is the important thing. Really. Because this makes the biggest difference. On. In most people's. World. Is stocks. And bonds. Although we do want to cover derivatives. Because they are their own. Unique. Class of financial assets. And explain what that word even means. You'll see all over the world. Or all over the internet. Which. I guess the internet. Is basically the world. But you'll see all over the internet. Discussion about derivatives. And what's going to happen with the. How are many trillions of dollars. In the derivatives market. And I think the average person. Would say. What on earth is it. Is a derivative. So we'll talk about that. In just a moment. Before we do that. We've got to set the stage. And we've got to start. With some definition of terms. And I'm going to use. Primarily a metaphor. And an example. To build on today. And we're going to talk through. Basically the construction. Of our own little company. And we're going to use this. To teach. How we would do. Stocks and bonds. And derivatives. With our own little company. That we're going to start. And then you'll understand. How these things work together. But before we do that. We've got to start. With the definition of terms. So the first term. That you need to understand. Is you need to understand. The difference. Between real assets. And financial assets. Real assets. And financial assets. So ultimately. In any society. In any economy. The material wealth. Of that society. Is determined. By the productivity. Of the economy. So if you talk to an economist. And they're trying to say. What is the. What are the. How well is this economy doing. What you're ultimately. Trying to measure. Is you're ultimately. Trying to measure. The productivity. Of an economy. But you're trying. To make that measurement. Based upon. Trying to measure. The output. The productivity. Now that can be measured. In different ways. It may be goods. It may be services. And so that's where you get. Into the gross domestic product. The gross national product. There are good things. About that. There are not so great things. I have an interesting book. On my reading list. About the gross domestic product. This lady from Britain. Wrote an entire book. On the GDP. And the history of it. And how it's. In some ways. A great measure. And in some ways. It's incredibly flawed. And so the. The macro. Economists. Come together. And talk. Back and forth. And try to figure out. How do we measure. The output of an economy. But the output of the economy. Is. Drives the wealth. Okay. But. The productive capacity. Of the economy. Is. Is a function. Of the real. Assets of the economy. So this would be. The land. The. Natural resources. The timber. The oil. The. The farmland. The buildings. The machines. The knowledge. All of these things. That go into. Actually. The ability. To produce. Goods. And services. So. Some economies. Will have. A built-in advantage. Some. Nations. Will have a built-in advantage. Over other nations. One tremendous reason. That the United States. Of America. Has been so. Incredibly. Economically successful. Is because this country. Has been incredibly. Blessed. With tremendous. Natural resources. If you go back. And you read the history. And you see. The tremendous. Natural resources. That. That. The. The nation. Was blessed with. Then that leads to. That leads. To. Ultimately. Wealth. That is a. Valid measure. Of wealth. Is that. The natural resources. That is in many ways. Real wealth. Now. What does that mean? I mean. You could. I'm not sure. How to define it. More. More. More. Accurately. But. But. Anytime you're talking. About real assets. You're essentially. Talking about real wealth. The ability. To produce. The daily needs. Of living. So food. Farmland. Would be real wealth. Shelter. Housing. Or building. Or lands. Would be real wealth. And then the ability. To have a productive. Economic machine. So the ability. To have a business. A business. That creates money. That would be. In my opinion. This would be. A productive machine. And you're into the world. Of. What would be. Kind of an offshoot. Of a real asset. Now. On the other hand. In contrast. To real assets. You have financial assets. So. Financial assets. Would be an example. Stocks and bonds. Are financial assets. Financial assets. Are purely. Pieces of paper. Or in today's world. Digital. Digital. You know. Digits. So. The majority of wealth. The financial wealth. That is held. In an economy. Is not real. At all. It's just digits. That exist. In a computer. That's all it is. The money. Even the pieces of paper. That we have. People talk about fiat money. And all that. And it's true. You have. Federal reserve notes. That are paper money. But you know what? The vast majority of money. Doesn't even exist physically. It's not tangible. It's an idea. And all that is. Is a financial assets. And so. The financial assets. Do not contribute. Directly. To the productive capacity. Of an economy. Rather. The financial assets. Represent a claim. On the productive. Assets of an economy. So. So. A financial asset. Is a claim. To an. Into the income. That's created. From something. That's created. From the real asset. So. The example is. You know. I may not be able. To own. A. An oil refinery. Or. Or an oil well. I may not have the ability. To own an oil well. But. I can still buy shares. In Exxon Mobil. And Exxon Mobil. Can go. And own the real asset. And then my financial asset. The stock. That I own. Represents my claim. On the income. That Exxon Mobil. Can earn. Based upon their. Based upon that. Based upon their. Oil wells production. So. All wealth. And all income. Ultimately comes. From real assets. And the financial assets. Just simply. Allocate. The income. Or the wealth. Among the investors. Among the owners. So. If you've come in. And you've transformed. Your human capital. Your labor. And your time. And your skills. Into. This concept. That we call money. Which is basically. A system of accounting. Then you can choose. To consume this goodwill. That you've bought. The system of accounting. This money. You can choose to consume it today. On something. Or you can choose. To invest it. For the future. So. In this world. The only rational way. To make that. Decision. Would be to say. Do I value. The consumption. That I can get. For today's. For today's. Expenditure. Or do I value. The future consumption. That I can have. With the investment growth. So the example here. That I come to. Comes to mind. Is the biblical story. Of Jacob and Esau. And at the end of Isaac's life. If you're not familiar. With the account. At the end of Isaac. Isaac was. Was the son of Abraham. And Jacob and Esau. Are the sons of Isaac. At the end of. Isaac's life. Then. Or excuse me. As part of Jacob and Esau's life. Jacob and Esau. Were born. They were twin brothers. And they were. At odds with each other. They fought. All the time. So at one point in time. Then. Esau was out hunting. And he had the ability. To go out and hunt. He was a master woodsman. He went out. He went out hunting. And he came in from a hunt. And he was. Esau was the firstborn. So in that system. In Israel. The firstborn. Was entitled to the larger share. Of the inheritance. It was called a birthright. And so. Esau came in from hunting. And he was incredibly hungry. He hadn't eaten. I think the hunt. Had been unsuccessful. If I remember my. My biblical. Stories correctly. And Jacob had prepared a soup. Or a meal of some kind. And Esau said. Hey Jacob. Can you give me some of the meal? Can I give me some food? And Jacob said. Yes. I'll give you the food. If you give to me your birthright. Your claim. On the major portion. Of the inheritance. From our father Isaac's estate. And so Esau. As the aphorism goes. Esau sold his birthright. For a bowl of soup. So. In my terms. Esau sold. His claim. On the future. Economic benefit. That he would have had. By being the firstborn. He sold the value. Of that future ability. To consume. For the benefit. Of today's consumption. He wanted it. He wanted the bowl of soup. He was hungry. He needed some food. So this is the. The. Decision. That we all face. Every day. My wife and I. Are in the process. Of painting our house. And so. If I go down. To the paint store. And I buy a $20. Can of paint. That can of paint. Is going to be. Consumed. By being spread. On the walls. Of our living room. So once. As it's spread. On the walls. Of our living room. I no longer have the ability. To gain the future income. From what that $20. Of. Of. Let's say I had bought. I had bought. Excuse me. My English is usually better than that. Let's say that I had purchased. A. One share of a stock. Valued at $20. And that stock was paying out. A $2. Dividend. Or. A $1. Dividend. It would be a 5% dividend rate. So a $1. Dividend. Each year going forward. So I'm giving. Up. The benefit of a dollar. Going forward. Into perpetuity. And having the value of the stock. For the benefit of having a painted living room. This is my decision. Now. I value. And she values. And we value. Having. A beautifully painted living room. More than I. Than we value. The money. The dollar. A year coming in. Off of the dividend of this stock. So. By. Putting these things into perspective. We can start to see. That one of the most important. Investment decisions. That we can make. Is which. What of. Of our capital. And of our. Of our. Our. Resources. That we've built together. So we take human capital. Work. Labor. Whether that's time. Invested. Skills. Knowledge. Skills. And abilities. We take this human capital. This ability to be productive. That we as humans have. And that human capital. Is usually turned into some form of financial capital. We call it money. A system of accounting. Among us. That's all money is. Is a representative concept. Of a system of accounting. So it doesn't matter. Whether it's U.S. dollars. Or. Or. Euros. Or gold coins. Or seashells. Or. Bitcoin. Or whatever. The system is. Money is just a system of accounting. And so. We take that system of accounting. That we now have. And we say. I'm going to choose to do. This. With the money. Now. If we're broke. And we don't have any. Any. If we don't have any food. Let's say that we live in an impoverished area of the world. And we. We're. We're earning just enough to pay our. Our daily. Our. Just enough money. To hopefully buy some food. I'm in close. We have some. I have some friends in. In parts of Africa. Where they're in this situation. Every day. Not knowing where today's. Food is going to be. And there's been crop failures. And crop shortages. And. They're. They don't have. Any ability to get today's food. Or to know exactly where it's going to come from. And so. In that world. The rational thing to do. Is to buy food. Because we've got to survive till tomorrow. And if we don't have food. For enough consecutive days. We're going to have a very difficult time. So we're forced to consume it. But when we can generate a surplus. Over and above what we need. For that daily need. Then we can decide. What do I do with the surplus? And so the. One of the decisions is. Are we going to buy. Real assets. Or are we going to buy. Financial assets. So real asset. Are we going to buy a house. To live in. So that we. So to shelter us. Are we going to purchase. Farmland. So that we can produce crops. Are we going to purchase. A timber. Attractive timber. With trees on it. So that we can sell the timber. Are we going to start a business. Or are we going to purchase. Financial assets. And lay claim. On some other aspect of income. So real assets. Ultimately drive. All economic growth. But yet. We're mostly used to looking at. Financial assets. Now the key is. If you were to look at. A payment of accounts. If you were to look at. A balance sheet. For something like. U.S. households. Or a country. Or an individual. If you were to look at. A balance sheet. You would see listed. A differentiation. Between the real assets. And the financial assets. So the real assets. Would be the real estate. Would be the factories. Would be these types. Of things that we've gone over. Probably too much. And the financial assets. Would be stocks. Bonds. Cash. Mutual funds. Debts. That are outstanding. Life insurance. Cash value reserves. Pension reserves. These types of things. But the key thing to remember. Is that all of those financial assets. Are financial assets. Of households. But they're liabilities. Of the issuer. Of the security. So let's say. That you have a hundred dollars. And you bring it to me. And you say. Joshua. I'm going to invest a hundred dollars. In the bank of Joshua. So as a bank. I would then say. I'm going to issue you. Let's assume. That I'm going to issue you. A piece of debt secured. I'm going to issue you a bond. Which will get to. In just a moment. So I'm going to issue you back. A hundred dollar bond. And I'm going to promise. To pay you. Five dollars of interest payments. Every single year. For the next five years. And at the end of five years. I'll return your hundred dollar. I'll return your hundred dollars. To you. So you now have an asset. On your balance sheet. That is called. A hundred dollar bond. From. You know. An IOU. From Joshua. And I now have a liability. On my balance sheet. So I owe you a hundred dollars. So if we were to look at this. In aggregate. Over a nation. Or over a community. Or over the world. In aggregate. What we would find. Is that all of the financial assets. Will ultimately cancel out. Because every financial asset. Is an asset for one entity. And it's a liability. For the other entity. So the financial asset. Would cancel out. And then we're ultimately. Only left with the real assets. So all. Whether it's. We're talking about. A community. Or a nation. Wealth. Is. Only consists. Of the real assets. The structures. The equipment. The inventory. Of products. The land. These types of things. That are real assets. Now. In financial planning. We almost. Exclusively focus. On financial assets. So we almost. Exclusively are talking. About money. About financial assets. But we really. Shouldn't start there. We really should. Really incorporate. Into our conversations. An accounting. Of real assets. And financial assets. Because sometimes. You can substitute. The two of them. So. As I mentioned. In the introduction. I believe. That a rational. Decision. I love avocados. It's one of my favorite. One of our favorite fruits. That we have. And we grow them well. Down here in Florida. We don't have the dark ones. That they have out in California. We don't have the. Hossa. Avocados. We have Florida. Avocados. And there's many varieties. Well. I'm planning to go. And buy some avocado trees. Avocados are expensive. Down here. Even though. Because what happens. They ship them in. From California. Or New Zealand. Or other places. And they're expensive. So. When my wife goes to the store. And brings home. A bag of avocados. For us to eat. That is. It's not. They're not cheap. I don't remember the exact price. They fluctuate with the season. But they're not cheap. So I can go. And I can buy an avocado tree. For say 25 bucks. So I plan. In the next couple of months. I need. I need to plant some avocado trees. So I'm going to go. And plant some avocado trees. And for a $25 tree. If I buy a $25 tree. And I plant it well. And I care for it well. A good. Mature avocado tree. That's 5 to 8. 10 years old. Is going to produce. Hundreds of pounds. Of avocados for me. In any. Kind of growing season. And what I plan to do. Is instead of planting one tree. Which just. Puts forth a torrent. Of avocados. That I can't eat them all. In one. In one season. Where you're just sick. And tired of eating avocados. Morning. Noon. And night. I plan to plant. Maybe four. Four or five trees. That ripen throughout the year. So I may have one crop. On one variety. That ripens in March. Another crop. On another variety. That comes in July. Another one in September. And the fourth one in December. And I plan to keep these trees small. So that I can allocate. More of my property. Which the small. Limited amount of space. That I have. Keep these trees small. So I can fit four trees in. Instead of one big tree. And have a smaller harvest. That spread over a period of time. So to me. To me. Spending $100. On four avocado trees. Is exactly. And should be part of. The investment decision. As should I put $100. Into my. You know. Cash value life insurance policy. Or should I put $100. Into. Apple stock. Or. I'm always going to use. Apple stock as the example. I don't own any apple stock. But it's going to be the example. Because I think it's still. The largest cap stock. On Wall Street. If my memory is correct. So. So this. This should be every bit. Of a rational decision. I would believe. Under the scenario. That I've given you. If I can buy a 25. Dollar fruit tree. And. It's not going to produce. Much for me. In the first couple of years. But then. This tree may have a lifespan. Of I don't know. 20, 30, 40, 50 years. I don't know how long. Avocado trees live. And I'm going to get. Hundreds of pounds of fruit. And I know that. Avocados are usually. A couple bucks of fruit. At the local fruit stand. That is a huge. Return on investment. And that's probably. Better for me. To focus on buying. That real asset. The avocado tree. At the beginning of my life. If my family likes. Avocados. Then for me. To buy the financial asset. That's going to give me. A certain amount of return. Me lending money. On a general electric. Bond. Or to lending money. To the U.S. government. On a U.S. savings bond. Where they're going to pay me. 2.8 percent. Interest. That does nothing. For my financial life. So I'm not going to do it. My going down. And buying. An avocado tree. For 25 bucks. Allows me in the future. To free up that. Maybe $10 a month. That I might spend on avocados. Or $5 a month. That I might spend on avocados. Into. The equivalent of basically. Perpetuity. And the wonderful thing about that. Is those avocados. Are not taxed. So now I can avoid the taxes. I can avoid the sales tax. I guess avocados aren't. Or their food. So they're not going to be sales tax. So I guess my example breaks down. But I got excited. But I can avoid the tax. And all of that gain. That's never taxed. So all the gain of the income. So okay. So that would be the example. Is that. I could on the one hand. Let's say I spend $10 a month. On avocados. I could go down. And every month. I'd have to earn. If I'm at a 20% effective rate. $12. To get my $10. That I can spend my after tax money. On avocados. Or I could just plant the avocado tree. And to me. That makes all the sense in the world. Now if I'm renting. In a small apartment. If I'm living in Hong Kong. Or Singapore. It's likely that I'm not going to be able. To make that scenario. But isn't that an intelligent way. To look at it. I mean. Not to pat myself on the back. It just. It makes sense to me. And so I feel. As though. It's smarter for me. Right now. To go and buy four avocado trees. And eight mango trees. And 16. You know. Well that's too many. Four orange trees. And some grapefruit. And some kiwi. And some blueberries. And really. Develop my property. To provide food for me. And plant a garden. My wife and I. Had this amazing tomato harvest. From our garden. It's so easy. You buy a packet of seeds. You stick them in the ground. The tomato plants grow. In Florida. They die when the summertime comes. So they're all dying out there. But no big deal. It cost us a dollar. And we've. We've reaped bowls. And bowls. Of little cherry tomatoes. That. And those things. If you go down to Publix. And get the package. Of cherry tomatoes. They're a couple bucks. So that's a real. Wonderful investment. And then the wonderful thing. About the cherry tomatoes. Is that. If they're not a hybrid variety. Or the avocados. Is that. They reap dividends. And I can reinvest those dividends. I can take an avocado off the tree. And if it's not a hybrid. Or if it's not grafted. I can go ahead. And I can just stick it in the ground. It'll grow again. It'll grow me another tree. And I can take. And I can sell those avocados. And I can sell to my neighbors. And friends. A bag of avocados. This is rational economic thought. Now. We could start an avocado plantation. And if we were going to do that. I might need more than $25. And so that might be where. We would get into the financial. Assets. So we're going there now. But remember that we're. Never lose sight of the fact. That the value of financial assets. And the success or failure. Of those financial assets. Is ultimately dependent. On the underlying performance. Of the real asset. That is backing the financial asset. So if you invest in my avocado plantation. And I go and I buy a hundred trees. And then I lose 50 of them. To a freeze or to a bug. That is going to really impact. The profitability of my avocado plantation. And the profitability of your financial asset. So we need to really. Always remember that. The financial assets are tied. To the real assets. Real assets generate income. Financial assets allocate that income. Now. In general. We're going to distinguish between. Basically three broad types of financial assets. Those three broad types. Are called different names. But you'll hear these always used interchangeably. They're essentially fixed income. Equity. And derivatives. Fixed income. Equity. And derivatives. So fixed income. Would be also. You'll also hear it referred to as a debt security. Or a bond. These are all the same things. Equities. Also referred to as stocks. Equities are shares of ownership. You would have equity. Or value of ownership. Or ownership. In a company. And then derivatives. And a derivative is something that derives its value. From the performance of something else. So let's talk through these. And I'm going to explain these terms. In a way that I hope makes sense to you. But. And then we're going to talk through. A practical example. Of how to use these. How a business would develop. And use these instruments. So fixed income is in many ways. The simplest. They're all simple. Fixed income is a simple type of investment. To understand. And so essentially a bond. A bond is basically. It's debt. It's lending money to a company. So the example here would be. If you were going to come to me. And you were going to say. Joshua. I need money. I said okay. How much do you need? I need $100. All right. I'll give you the $100. And I'll lend it to you. But I'm not going to give you the $100. That I could spend on my consumption. Unless you can give me. Some additional benefit. That I can't get by consuming the money myself. So you say well I'll pay you. Instead of when I bring it back. Instead of paying you $100. I'll pay you $105. And I'll return it to you. A year from now. So we're all familiar. With the idea of a loan. You have an interest rate. I say that would be good. I would value more. Having $105 in one year. I would value that more. Than having the $100 to use today. So therefore I'll give you my $100. And you can use it for a year. This is the simple concept of debt. That's what a bond is. Except in general. It's not usually just one year. Although it could be. More typically when we think of bonds. We think about it as something like this. I'm going to lend you my $100. You're going to pay me $5 every year. For the next five years. And then at the end of five years. You're going to give me back my $100. So in that bond. I'm going to lend you the $100. I'm going to get my $5. So that would be if I were to lend to a company. Or if I were to lend to a government. Now your ability to make good. On those payments. Those $5 annual payments to me. Your ability to make good on those payments. Is very much dependent on. Whether you have the money or not. So the performance of a bond. Is very closely tied. To the financial condition of the borrower. Or in bond terms. This is called the issuer. Who issues the bond. So in our example of the $100 and the $5. You would issue me a $100 bond. With what's called a $5 coupon payment. And the coupon payment. Refers to in old days. They would send a book of coupons. That you would use. To lay claim on your interest payments. And so it's called a coupon payment. A 5% coupon payment. That gets paid based upon the $100 security. So you create the security. You create the financial asset. And that financial asset is backed. Based upon your ability. To make the payments to me. Now there are vast. Vast. A vast array of different ways. That these types of bonds. That bonds could be structured. That they could be securitized. That they could be issued. They can be. They can be on fixed interest rate payments. Where we're going to pay you 5% per year. They could be based on floating interest rates. So for example. If I were a corporation. I could borrow money for you at 1.8% above the rate paid on U.S. Treasury bills. So the government has its borrowing rate. Let's say that's 2%. And I'm going to pay you 1.8% on top of that. So that would be 3.8%. So then I could adjust every year. So those. But the reason that it's called a fixed income investment. Is that you know. How much your payment is going to be. If it's a 5% fixed interest rate. A 5% fixed interest rate. A 5% fixed coupon rate. Then you know every year you're getting 5 bucks. Or if it's determined by a formula. You know all you got to do. Pull up and open the newspaper. See what U.S.T. bills are paying. Add 1.8%. You know that on December 31st. When my bond payment is due. Then you're going to receive. In my example. $3.80. So it's a fixed income. And so it's. But it's. My ability to pay is purely determined. Based upon. If I'm the issuer of the bond. My ability to pay is based upon my financial state. There can be short term bonds. Long term bonds. So if you're the U.S. government. And you're borrowing money. You issue treasury bills. Notes and treasury bonds. So treasury bills are short term. Notes are intermediate term. Bonds are long term. If you are a local municipality. You could issue short term. You could issue long term. If you're a company. You could issue very short term. You could issue. You could issue very short term or long term. I won't go into more details. But right now. This could be. Across the board. And they can be risky. Or they can be very very safe. So the U.S. government bonds. That the U.S. government issues. Are generally considered to be the safest. That they could possibly be. And there's zero risk of default. By investing in U.S. government bonds. And the reason that there's zero risk of default. Is because the U.S. government has. The legal ability. And the legal authority to tax people. So the U.S. government will always be able. To make payments on. Bonds. As long as they retain the ability. To tax the income from people. To ensure that those payments are made. Many of you are immediately thinking. What about the value of those payments? That's another issue. Show for another time. U.S. issued securities. Have zero risk of default. Because the government can tax the people. Now if the government lost the ability. To tax the people. So in the United States. In the Civil War. What would happen when the Confederate. Government in the southern states. Issues its bonds. And it promises to pay people back. The money in exchange for them. Giving it to the government. Well the government loses the war. Government goes bankrupt. The bonds become worthless. That'd be an interesting piece. I made that up off the top of my head. Because I believe it's true. If anyone knows. I'd be interested in reading a book about that. If anyone knows of any books. Or any information on that. I'll have to research that later. But so if the government loses the ability to tax. My point is that if the government loses. Its ability to tax the people. Then it loses its ability. To make those payments. On its debts. That's debt securities. That's fixed income securities. Now the second type of assets. Are called equities. Or stock. So equity. A stock represents. It's a financial asset. That represents an ownership claim. So instead of it representing. A debt claim. A crediting claim to a company. Equity represents an ownership claim. And so a bondholder. Is promised a stock. At a certain payment rate. That's why it's called fixed income. An equity holder is not promised. Any particular payment. So there's no specific amount. That an equity holder can be promised. So this is why. If you own stock in a company. You really never know. How much you're going to get for your asset. You really never know how much. For example if your company is paying a dividend. And a dividend is a share of the profits. That are returned to the owners of the company. If your company is paying a dividend. You never know from quarter to quarter. If the dividends are declared quarterly. How much your dividends are going to be. Now some companies are very consistent. Some companies are not. And a company may increase those dividends. Or may decrease the dividends. Depending on what's going on in the individual business. But you're not necessarily promised any specific amount. You get the dividends that the firm pays. And you have a portion of. You have an allocated percentage of ownership. In the assets. In the real assets of the company. So if you and I are going to go. Into an opportunity. An avocado plantation together. And we decide to make you an equity holder. Let's assume that you invest $100. And I invest $100. And you own 50% of the stock. And I own 50% of the stock. And we buy 10 trees. Well you own 50% of the value of those trees. So if we need to split up. We can sell the trees on the secondary market. And we can split our money. So we can share our money between us. And so hopefully. My example is not a very good one. With the avocado plantation. Because it's kind of hard to dig a tree up without killing it. But it is theoretically possible. So the performance of. Equity investments. Is directly tied to the success of the firm. And directly tied to the performance of its real assets. So because of this. You'll have a lot more. Volatility. A lot more fluctuations. In the price of. Equity securities. Than you would have. Than you will have. In debt securities. Because debts. Because those payments are promised. At a certain time. At a certain amount. It's a little bit more consistent. But because the equity payments are not promised. At a certain time. At a certain amount. Then there may be more variability. In the amounts of payments. That are paid to the person. Who owns the financial asset. Now there are other advantages. And disadvantages of it. So in. For example. If the company were to go bankrupt. Bondholders come ahead. So creditors to the company. The bondholders. Come ahead of the owners of the company. This would be normal. If you owned a company. And you had debts that you had to pay. And you had to close your doors. Then you would pay. Paying those debts first. If there was any money. You sold all your assets in the company. You'd be paying those debts first. To. To your creditors. Before you would be taking. Whatever was left over. For yourself. To have in your own. Your own money. So. Hopefully that's a good background. On fixed income. And debt securities. The third type of. Financial asset. That is a primary. A primary type of financial asset. Is called a derivative. And so. A derivative security. Is a financial asset. That derives its value. Based upon the underlying performance. Of another financial asset. So you might hear. The words options. Or futures contracts. And so. There are many types of derivatives. But options or futures contracts. Would be the specific. The specific amounts. So. And we'll talk. In detail. Another time. About options. And futures. But. You could do. You could purchase. Something called a call option. On a stock. And so. If you purchased a call option. On a stock. You would pay money. To somebody. That would. And that. Payment that you would make. Would allow you to buy the stock. As long as a certain. A certain thing. Turned out to be. Turned out to be true. So let's say that. Under a call option. Let's say that you're going to buy. One share. Of. Of. Of XYZ corporation stock. And. You have the option to buy it. For. Say. Thirty dollars per share. You're going to pay. You're going to pay. The. The. Your. Trading partner. In the derivatives world. You're going to pay. That person. Say. Two dollars. For the option to buy the stock. At thirty dollars per share. Now. And. There's a. Certain time period. That's applied to that. So let's say that. Anytime within the next. Six months. So. Let's say you buy. A six month call option. On. XYZ corporate. Thirty dollars a share. What you are hoping. Is that. The. That. The. And you paid. Two dollars for it. If my. In my example. What you're hoping. Is that the value of that stock. The market value. The market price of that stock. Will increase. Higher than thirty dollars. So if. Six months from now. The market price of that stock. Is currently at forty dollars. Then what you would do. Is you would go ahead. And do what's called. Exercise the option. You would go ahead. And pay me. Thirty dollars. For the stock. And then you would turn around. And you could turn around. And sell it. At forty dollars. So. What you've effectively. Been able to do. Is you've been able to control. The thirty dollars. Worth of stock. For an outlay. Out of pocket. Of two dollars. And the value. Of that control. Is what drives. The value. Of your security. So if. In my example. If the market price. Of the stock. Goes up to forty dollars. And you are. Have. You have had the ability. To buy. The stock. For thirty. Plus your two dollar. Cost of buying the option. And then you turn around. And sell it. You've profited eight dollars. So that's a. That's a profit. For your six months. Of. For your six months. But. If the market price. Of the stock. In the open market. Is twenty five dollars. Then what happens. Is your option. Becomes worthless. It's worthless. Because. You would have no reason. To go. And pay thirty dollars. To exercise the option. To buy the stock. When you can just go around. And pay twenty five bucks. Because now you're. You're. If you were. You were all in. You still wanted to buy the stock. You're essentially paying. Thirty two dollars. For the stock. When you could buy it. Twenty five bucks. The two dollars. For the insurance. Or excuse me. For the. For the option price. Plus the. Twenty. Plus the thirty dollars. For the. For exercising the option. So. The derivative. The value of that security. Is going to be derived. Based upon the underlying performance. Of XYZ corporation stock. The derivatives will go. All over the place. And as far as their value. But the key thing. Is to notice. That they can be. Hugely valuable. Or they can be worthless. If you had. The. If you had a call option. On XYZ corp. And if that call option. If. And you could buy it. Thirty bucks. And you paid two dollars for it. And let's say. That XYZ corporation. Invented the. Guaranteed cure for cancer. And they are set to make. Billions. And so the market price. Of the stock. Increases to a hundred dollars. Or two hundred dollars. Or a thousand dollars. You have a huge. Upside. But. If the cure for cancer. Turns out to be bogus. You have. An unlimited risk of loss. Because you can. Well. Not unlimited technically. You have. You have a risk of total loss. Where you can lose. All of the two dollars. You don't have any claim. On the financial assets. Of the company. You don't have any claim. On. Like you would. If you invested in the stock. Directly. You don't have any claim. Over. Forcing the company. To sell the factory. And taking. A portion of that portfolio. Of that. Money for yourself. So. The underlying. A value of the stock. Literally. Becomes worthless. If the. If the. When the. When the exercise. Date. Arrives. So. Hopefully. That makes sense. It's just a. Brief. Blink. Into derivatives. And. Today. Derivatives are really. A major part. Of the. Larger investment. Environment. And there's many. Many ways. And reasons. That they can be used. They can be used. As speculative instruments. Or they can be used. As. Ways to manage. Risk. So. Probably. The. The primary way. That derivatives are used. Today. Is to. Hedge risk. Or to transfer. The risk. Of a certain thing. Happening. So. If you're managing a. If you're managing. A portfolio. You may be concerned. About a certain thing. Happening in your portfolio. And you recognize. That my portfolio. If. This event occurs. Then I may want to. I may be in a problem. So. You may go ahead. And say. Well. I want to insure. Against that. And. And the way. That you insure. Against. That. In a portfolio. Is through the use. Of derivatives. Whether it's options. Futures. Swaps. There's. Lots of. Variation. On these. But that's. Essentially. The. The value. Of derivatives. So. Don't. And then. Last thing. As far as. Assets. As far as. Investments. Don't forget. That you could always. Invest. In real assets. Directly. So. The choice. Is not always. Should I. The choice. Is not always. Should I buy. This. This stock. Or should I buy. This bond. Or. But rather. The choice. Is more of. You know. Again. Fruit trees. Or shares. Of XYZ Corp. So. That's just a brief overview. Now. I want to give you an example. And talk about. Some different ways. That these can be used. So. You can use. This concept. Of stocks. And bonds. And you can use. This in a large. Context. Of. Of. The stock market. Quote. Unquote. As we're. Accustomed to thinking about it. Or you can use it. In a smaller context. And. It's exactly the same tools. They're just applied. In a different concept. In a different context. So. Let's start with a very. Very simplistic. Overly simplistic example. And let's. Talk about some. Some of the ways. That. We would use. Stocks and bonds. In our business. Let's talk about some of the advantages. And disadvantages. I am going to completely ignore. Now. Derivatives. And. Because derivatives are. A little bit more challenging. If you're not. Comfortable with the lingo. A little bit more challenging. To wrap your head around. And. I think we had enough. Of an insight. With just a simple. Options example. But. You could use. Derivatives. And basically. You could. Create derivatives. If you can find a buyer. For the market. You're basically making bets. On something happening. And. As long as you're willing. To agree to the terms. And agree to the price. And agree to the risk. Then. Then the derivative. Should. Should work. But for now. Let's ignore derivatives. And let's just focus on stocks. And bonds. So. You and I have. I have an idea. I have noticed. That people are. Drinking coffee. And that gourmet coffee. Has now become. Quite in vogue. And. I went. To. You'll notice. I'm stealing the story. Let's say. That I went. To a European country. I went to Italy. And I noticed. That in Italy. It's quite. What's the French saying? I think. The. The. The. The. The. The. The. The. The. The. The. The. The. Quite. If I. If my. My usage is correct. Quite. Quite popular. To sit in a coffee shop. And. Enjoy my coffee. And I come to the US. And I noticed that. I noticed that. In my country. In the United States. That people. Coffee is more of just. Something that you get at the cafe. In a brown cup. For 22 cents. And I think. Why is it that Americans. Always drink coffee. With their breakfast. Why don't they actually go. And just drink coffee. Like the Italians do. So I decide to open a coffee shop. Now. I don't have any money. But. I read the book. That Jake DeSilis wrote. On entrepreneurship. And I said. Well why would I ever go. And get a job. When I could just start a business. Instead. And I listened to Joshua. And he said. Look. There's no risk. What's the worst that can happen. I'm going to go bankrupt. Big deal. So I'm going to go bankrupt. That's why. So I'm going to go ahead. And try something. So there's no risk. I don't have any money now. I might make a lot. Or I might lose. But regardless. If I do some smart stuff. I'm not going to lose. And I can control the risk. And I can always go sleep. On mom and dad's couch. And mom will feed me. So. I'm going to open a coffee shop. Because I would. I think people would enjoy. This experience. So. But. Let's see. In my example. Who's. Okay. So I'm the guy. I'm the guy opening the coffee shop. And you're the person with the money. So. I come to you. And you have $100,000. That you got. Because your great aunt Matilda. Just died. And left you $100,000. And you say. Well Joshua. Do you need some money? And I say. Yes I do. Well. There's a couple ways. That I could give you the money. How much do you need? Well frankly. I need $100,000. To get started. I got to buy some coffee. Machinery. I got to rent a space. I've got to hire some employees. I've got to invest in some marketing. So that people will know. That I'm there. I got to build a logo. I've got to buy aprons. For my employees. So I've got. I need $100,000. And. So I said. Well. I'm willing to consider this. And. You look at me. And you say. Well. What would you like to do? Would you like to borrow the money. From me. Or would you like me. You say. Would you like to. Me to invest in the company. I tell you. Well. Frankly. I'd like to borrow the money. Okay. What are your terms? Well you as a rational person. You have $100,000. And you're looking at me. And let's pretend. That my example. I was a young 18 year old kid. Who just got back. From. From backpacking around Italy. And you're saying. Well. How good is Joshua really. At running a business. After all. He has no business experience. He has this kind of a harebrained idea. That he wants to create a coffee shop. Like the Italians do. And he wants it to be a certain way. But. Really. People like paying 25 cents a cup. For a cup of coffee. And he wants to charge $3 a cup. So how on earth. Is this even going to work. And. You say. I think this is pretty risky. It might work. And it. It might work. But. It could be pretty risky. So you say. Well. I can get. Down at the bank. I can get 2% interest on my money. So. That's my. Essentially. My risk free. My risk free return. And usually. In an investment world. We would usually not use the bank. We would use a. Government securities. We'd use a treasury bond. And say. Well. My risk free rate of return. If I do nothing else. I could lend money to the U.S. government. And they'll tax their people. Into oblivion. To pay me. So. I'll go ahead. And just lend my money to the government. There's my 2% return. That's my risk free rate of return. So you've got to go over and above it. And if you say. Well. If I charge Joshua. 3% rate of return. I could lend it to the government. At 2%. I don't think that's enough. Of a. Of a. Of an interest rate. For me to. Take a bet on him. And. Then also over here. I noticed that I read in the newspaper. That Walmart. Is issuing a bond. For. $100 million. To do. Some project. That they're doing. And they'll pay me. A 4% rate of return. If I give them. $100,000. So. I think Walmart. Has probably got a brighter future. Than Joshua's coffee shop. So you're going to sit down. And you're going to. You're going to figure out. There's. There's going to be some analysis. In your mind. Of at what point in time. Am I willing to lend. This $100,000. To Joshua. Now that. That number. May be at 5%. Or it may be at 55%. It's just completely. You may not even be willing. To lend it. So. But let's just say. As an example. Let's say that. It is going to be. $15,000. 15% rate of return. Or 10% rate of return. And so. Under this example. If you say. I'm going to lend it. At 10% rate of return. Then. I look at. My books. As the borrower. And say. Can I afford to do that? Well. That means. I got to come up with. $10,000. In the first year. Of my coffee shop. On top. Of paying me. Paying my employees. On top of all the expenses. To pay the bond. To pay the bond payment. And I may say. Listen. I'm not sure. I can do that. Well. We would have that option. If I think I can. Then I can do that. Then I would go ahead. And accept the deal. If I could make the $10,000. But I may not be able. To do it. So you say. Well. I would be willing. To lend you the money. But. Excuse me. Instead of lending you the money. I apologize. Instead of lending you the money. I'd be willing. To invest the money. With you. And I'd be willing to. In exchange. For a percentage. Of the company. I would be willing. To invest the money. And so. We can go in. As 50-50 partners. In this company. And I will invest. My $100,000. And you will invest. Your time. And effort. And knowledge. And ideas. To build the company. And then. We will split. The profits. That we make. So that would be. A stock investment. So I would draw up. Some papers. And I would issue. Shares of stock. And I could issue. Two shares of stock. And I could issue. One share to me. And one share to you. Now. Realistically. One of the values. Of companies. Is that. We can issue. More shares of stock. So I would probably. Issue 1,000 shares of stock. And then 500 of them. Would go to you. And 500 of them. Would go to me. Now. This is an incredible way. Of basically creating wealth. When a company issues stock. It's simply. Issuing ownership. In an identity. In an idea. In a concept. In exchange for money. So if I created this situation. Then what I've really done. In this scenario. If I create. My company. And I issue 1,000 shares of stock. And you give $100,000. And I buy $100,000 of assets. I have just. Printed money from my company. By issuing you shares of stock. Now you. Have claim. Over 50% of the assets. But I have claim. Over 50% of the assets as well. So. We've just had this transaction. And my company. Has been. Decapitalized. It had money come in. To build my company. And. Now. I'm ready to go. With stocks. And we could do this. We do this. People. Entrepreneurs do this. Every single day. Now. It's very simple. With one person. But what if I want to go ahead. And over time. Let's say you and I. Business grows. You've chosen to invest in my company. You own stock in my company. And we're doing really well. And now we have two locations. In my hometown. But I've. I've done market research. And I know there's people. All over the country. That are asking for. More shares. That are asking. For these locations. Of my. My coffee business. In their town. Well. In this situation. And we could go. And we could say. We need more money. But you don't have any more. And I don't have any more. And we're trying to fund it. Out of the profits of the company. But we can't really expand fast enough. Because we're only making a profit. Of a few thousand bucks a month. And every new store. That we open. Is a hundred thousand. Is a hundred thousand dollars. So we're profitable. But we're not profitable enough. To grow very fast. We can only open two stores a year. We'd like to do 200 stores a year. So we could go to the open market. We could go to the public market. And this is what's called. An investment lingo. This is called a primary offering. Or an initial public offering. And we could say. We would like to solicit you. To invest your money with us. Our business plan. Is that we're going to open. A chain of stores. And in exchange. For you giving us your money. So that we can open. Our chain of coffee stores. You're going to give us your money. And we're going to try to raise. Ten million dollars. Or a hundred million dollars. And you're going to try. To give us your money. And in exchange for that. We'll give you shares of the company. So we draw up. Some fancy stock certificates. Or in the past. We would have done that. Now we just created. An entry in a. In a journal. In a journal entry. A journal entry in a ledger. And we print up these. These shares of stock. Then we go ahead. And we issue them. To the public market. And let's say that you think. That's a good investment. So you give us your money. Now we have ten. Ten million dollars. So we go ahead. And we start opening stores. And then now you. Have claim. In a share. Of the profit. From all of those stores. This is how companies work. This is how business works. Now there are various players involved. And it can work. All along the way. And then that same company. After we've issued. The more shares of the stock. And we've grown out. To be a hundred stores. We may need to. Some. Some. We may want to start. Building buildings. And so we need a special. We need a special. Influx of cash. To go ahead. And build our own buildings. Our freestanding locations. Instead of. Going ahead. And building. Instead of going ahead. And renting them. So we may issue a bond. And we may promise. To pay a five percent. Payment. If you'll lend us the money. And the reason. That we would do that. Is if we could borrow the money. From you. The public. The public. At more favorable terms. Than we could borrow the money. From a bank. So. Hopefully. My example made sense. And it was a little bit interesting. But you can do this. At all different scales. You can do this. At every single scale. You can do this. As an individual. You know. You can do this. As an individual. And own a corporation. You can do this. With a couple of people. And own a corporation. It can be a small corporation. It can be a large corporation. So everything. From Apple computers. Or whatever. Apple Inc. To. A local mom. And pop cleaning business. You can do this. Now. The value of those shares. Is going to be based upon. The company. That's under. That's underlying. And the assets of the company. If I have a cleaning business. And I try to. To sell you. Shares in my cleaning business. But my cleaning business. Consists of me. And my car. With a broom. And a mop. Going to the local. Going to someone's house. And trying to say. Hey. I don't really have any assets. Basically. I have customer accounts. So to try to issue a stock. Based upon that. And you to figure out. What the value of that is. It's very difficult. That's very. Different than Exxon Mobil. That they say. Look at these oil wells. Look at all this. This. These assets that we have. And you can more easily. Figure out what the value. Of the stock would be. So. If you understand that. And it seems a little simplistic. But if you really understand. That it helps. When you're trying to figure out. What should I invest in. And how should I invest. And do all of that. So the key point. That I wanted to try to. Drive home today. Is that you need to really understand. How these things work. And hopefully. This just basic introduction. To stocks and bonds. Would give you some idea. Of what these are. And you can use these. At every stage of your wealth. You could use these. If you have a lot of money. And you want to buy shares. Of general electric stock. You can also use this. If you don't have any money. And you're trying to start a business. And so you're trying to start a business. You can issue shares of stock. And raise capital. You can use bonds. If you want to invest. In long term savings bonds. For your grandchildren. And you say. The U.S. government. Is always going to be there. It's not going to be much. It's not going to have risk. You know. Risk of default. But. You know. At least. At least it's safe. I'm going to go ahead and get it. So you can lend your money. To the U.S. government. Or you can lend your money. To. General Motors. When they need. When they issue a bond. Or you can lend your money. To the local municipality. When they want to build a new highway. Or when they want to build a new stadium. These types of things. Now. With every one of those transactions. And decisions. Then there's going to be. There's going to be a trade off. Now here's the key point. That I'm going to end with. Buying stocks. Or shares of ownership. In companies. In the publicly traded markets. It's not always going to be the best move. I don't believe it's possible. To get really get rich quick. On buying stocks. Because. You have a large company. That's a very valuable thing. But for your. If you're a young person. It's not going to do much for you. What is. You know. What is. A 10 percent. Growth rate going to mean. If you're going to investing a hundred dollars. Over a long period of time. A huge amount of money. But over the next five or ten years. How much is it really going to mean? Now. If you have a decision. Between not investing a hundred dollars. Let's just run some numbers. Here. And usually. Let's say that you're 20 years old. And you're listening to me. And you're going to go to the. Traditional retirement age of 65. So let's just say. You're going to invest a hundred dollars. A month. Let's say that you're going to get. The. Let's clear this out here. Clear the register. Okay. A hundred dollars a month. It's our payment. We're going to do this for 45 years. On a monthly basis. We're going to use. A 10 percent number. Compounded. 10 percent annually. For the rate of return. And we're going to start with nothing. At the end of 45 years. If you invest a hundred dollars. You're going to have. A one million. Forty eight thousand. Two hundred and fifty dollars. And seventeen cents. Not adjusted for inflation. So we're going to have. A million bucks. But the reality is. Is that what does a million bucks. Do for us in 45 years. Versus what could we do. With a hundred dollars. Now if we took that hundred dollars. And we went out. And we started a business. With it today. We have the possibility. Of instead of making. A 10 percent rate of return. To make a 10 thousand percent. Rate of return. If we take an idea. And we put an idea. For a film. And we put it on Kickstarter. And we get that film funded. And then we. We raise our capital that way. Or if we issue stock. Or if we. Whatever our project is. We can do it quicker. Or if we go and buy. Fruit trees for the yard. Or if we go and. Invest in. Whatever we invested. I mean this is what. The choices of investment. Should be. So once you understand. The role that these. Financial assets can have. You could decide. If it's worth it to you. To invest your money. Into. General electric stock. Or if it's worth your. Worth your money to you. To invest your money. In. Hosting for your podcast. On financial. Planning to. To teach people. About the topics. Of financial planning. I personally decided. That's a better investment. For me right now. Now. Is it always going to be so. No. Absolutely. Absolutely not. It doesn't get better. If you have money. And if you want. True. Financial independence. If you want. True. Capitalism. Where you can just sit back. And you can collect money. Without. Any real work. True. Financial independence. Where you don't have to do. Anything. I think only. Ultimately comes. From. Loaning companies. That you don't need to. Necessarily control. Or be involved. In. And I tell you. General Electric. And Apple. And Exxon Mobil. And Walmart. And. These companies. That's an amazing way. To do it. But if you're just getting started. And you're trying to fix something out. It may. Or it may not be. The right move for you. So. All financial planning. Comes down to personal. And this is why. I'm building this show. Because. For so many years. I got motivated. And I read these books. On. Put your money. In the stock market. I think that's awesome. I've managed. Large portfolios. But. I wish. At this. Point. That instead of opening. A Roth IRA. On my 18th birthday. That I had started. A couple of businesses. Because you know what. There's no one. On the Forbes 400. That got there. By opening a Roth IRA. Entrepreneurship. And building something. And investing in something. That you own. Or that you control. Is. Is. Is going to be incredible. Now what that is for you. I don't know. But. The decision. Should not be. Should I buy shares of Apple. Or shares of GE. The decision should be. Should I buy shares of Apple. Should I buy shares of GE. Should I buy. A pickup truck. And start a landscaping business. Should I build a rental house. And rent it out. Because I have the ability. To build things. And. And. And. Put a tenant in there. And give them a place to live. Should I buy a local. Hotel franchise. And invest in a days in. At the local. Interchange. Between. You know. The interstate. And the local road. Should I buy a subway franchise. And open a subway location. Should I. Buy treasury bonds. From the U.S. government. Should I pay off my. High interest rate credit card debt. Or should I pay off my house. Should I buy solar panels. From my house. So I can. Reduce or eliminate. My electric bill. Should I insulate my attic. So that I can reduce. Or eliminate my electric bill. Should I buy fruit trees. From my front yard. So that I don't need to. Buy so much groceries. Should I. Call up and buy a load. Of horse manure. From my backyard garden. So I can grow some food. Should I buy gold coins. Or should I. Buy food. Should I buy cans of soup. For the pantry. Should I. Give the money away. Or should I go and buy education. And a college degree. Which hopefully will. Will get me a higher. Higher value in the marketplace. This is the decision. And this is why. All financial planning. Must be. Intensely personal. I'm never going to tell anyone again. Without knowing them. Here's what you should do. With your money. You should just go. And you should buy this stock. Or you should invest in. This index fund. Or you should do this. It's so much bigger. And more complicated. Than that. But. It's so much simpler. Than that. But you've got to look at your life. And you've got to figure out. What are my skills. What are my goals. What are the things. That I'm trying to do. What is it. What is it. That's going to work for me. And then based upon. That. Then you can make. A rational decision. About what will serve you. And your interests. And your goals. To the best. To the best. You can make a rational decision. On what will serve you. And your interests. And your goals. In the best way. And in the most intelligent way. For you to get. From here to there. In the quickest way. So. Remember. You can literally. And that's why I get so excited. About entrepreneurship. Is because. A lot of times. People say. I'm broke. I don't have any money. Okay. How are you going to get it? I don't know. I only earn X amount of dollars. Well. Why are you only earning. X amount of dollars? There's people making. Ten times what you're making. No matter how much you're making. So why don't you become. One of those people. Can earn ten times that much. You can start at Walmart. As whatever their. Basic entry level wages. And retire a multi-millionaire. You can move up. In any company. Any business. Or you can just go out. And create your own. I was watching a video. On YouTube. I was researching. Some camera things. And I saw a guy. He actually. I was watching. His creative live class. That he taught. Which. If you have any interest. In creative arts. Go check out creative live. They're doing an amazing job. Of just incredible. Free. Creative education. On photography. And music. And just all of these. Fascinating classes. That are all available for free. Right on their website. They have at this point. I think five studios. Running around 24 hours a day. On their network. And I was watching. The photography class. And this guy. Was a filmmaker. And I guess. He was doing some work. For. He was doing some work. For somebody. He was flat broke. And he was doing some work. With a guy. As a part time employee. But he wanted to make a movie. And so this. This man. Had written a script. For his movie. And. He wanted to create it. So he had some friends. Of his acting. And he'd written the script. And he borrowed from his boss. He borrowed. The camera. And all they had. Was one of these. Canon digital SLR cameras. Basically about $750. Worth of gear. A $500 camera. He went to. Home Depot. Bought a roll of duct tape. Duct tape. A piece of wood. And a broomstick. Onto a skateboard. To make his dolly. To create his movement shots. And he created a movie. Which he wound up. Producing. And he created the whole thing. And he sold it. And he wound up. I didn't get the full story. But he wound up. Making some money. And just breaking into. A whole new career. And a movie career. And being able. Just to do something. With almost no. With almost nothing. Equipment. Just a little bit of skill. And a little bit of ideas. And you see that all the time. I mean. In today's world. You can literally print money. Without being the government. You can print money. If you can bring. Knowledge. Skills. And ideas. To the table. So whether it's through. A kickstarter. Whether it's through. Issuing stock. Whether it's just through. Doing. You know. Creating a feature length film. With excellent production value. That you can display. And get your break. Into the movie business. With $750. Worth of camera equipment. I was blown away. By the quality of his. Of his. Production. It was amazing. Like you can do this. You can do this. But you got to think about. It's going to be unique for you. So. That's why. And in essence. That's what my frustration. With kind of being. A traditional financial advisor. Is that. If I was paid. Based upon the sale. Of securities. And you tell me. Joshua. I want to make a movie. There's so many different ways. To handle that. And I just have to say. Well I mean. Maybe you should not invest. $100. In an IRA. And rather you should take that money. And go make your movie. You should only invest. $100 in an IRA. If Walmart. Is going to pay you more money. For easier. In exchange for them. Having your $100. Then you can do it. In your own life. So I want to empower you. To make those decisions. Hopefully today's. Information. Has been interesting. You know. Sometimes with. A lot of these shows. With just as far as. The detailed information. I'm not sure exactly. How this is all going to work. Over the long term. I just feel like. I got to set the foundation. And sometimes people are saying. What are stocks and bonds. And I don't know about you. But. There was very little. Thought about this in school. And even though. I went to a school. That did actually teach. Some of this stuff. I didn't learn it through that. I. I. I. I. I. I. learned it through myself. I tell you, I've heard some people say some crazy stuff about stocks and this is what's going to happen with stocks. This is what's going to happen with bonds. I think you understand what a stock or a bond is. Hopefully, today has helped with that. Crave your feedback on the show.
