I was in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qgIFD0PaWo&t=370" target="_blank">00:06:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">kindergarten. And I looked up and there was a cloud in the sky. And I said, "Mr. Mayor,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qgIFD0PaWo&t=377" target="_blank">00:06:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">is that cloud as big as the world?"

Now in my seven-year-old mind, I went, "Okay, I can see the outlines of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qgIFD0PaWo&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And that must mean it is so far away, because if that's as big as the world..." I remember it took</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qgIFD0PaWo&t=404" target="_blank">00:06:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">15 hours just to drive from Longview to Florida last year. And I can't even see that far. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qgIFD0PaWo&t=412" target="_blank">00:06:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that cloud must be so far off that it's not worth me even considering space, dreams,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qgIFD0PaWo&t=422" target="_blank">00:07:02.560</a></span> | <span class="t">any of that.

Because dealing with dreams and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qgIFD0PaWo&t=432" target="_blank">00:07:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">what's out there and not on this earth that gravity holds down, not worth considering.

It's not even worth imagining. It's fairy dust. So I think I learned a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qgIFD0PaWo&t=447" target="_blank">00:07:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">self-reliance from that. I think I got a work ethic from that. I think I got a, "Hey, focus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qgIFD0PaWo&t=455" target="_blank">00:07:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">on what's right in front of you.
