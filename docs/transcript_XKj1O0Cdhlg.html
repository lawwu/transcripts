I think it's probably mostly efficient in places where space repetition, as it stands without substantial, like novel cultural knowledge, that's difficult to transmit and isolate where all of that is valuable. We see a lot of space repetition usage. So among medical students are highly motivated, have lots of reason to study.</p><p>And the material is shaped in a way that's highly amenable to space repetition usage. There's tons of space repetition usage. Duolingo has space repetition integrated into it. Space repetition is kind of naturally present in the process of immersion learning. In fact, modern space repetition tools between the Leitner box and Wozniak super memo, they were both originally motivated by language learning.</p><p>So in language learning, there's like a substantial market for space repetition.</p></div></div></body></html>
