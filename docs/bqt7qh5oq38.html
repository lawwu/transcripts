towards weight training, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqt7qh5oq38&t=71" target="_blank">00:01:11.760</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:01:15.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you look at it over a course of a training week, I mean, five days in a gym would be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqt7qh5oq38&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.520</a></span> | <span class="t">a great task.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqt7qh5oq38&t=80" target="_blank">00:01:20.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And obviously not in the gym, it could be done at home, but three days strength training,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqt7qh5oq38&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Monday, Wednesday, Friday, conditioning, Tuesday, Thursday, you know, two days, it's a, it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqt7qh5oq38&t=88" target="_blank">00:01:28.900</a></span> | <span class="t">a pretty easy roundabout way to split that up, of course, depending upon training goals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqt7qh5oq38&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And as you said, the aesthetic goals like that will shift dramatically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqt7qh5oq38&t=97" target="_blank">00:01:37.560</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you want to see the benefits of both, that's probably the, the effective dose for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqt7qh5oq38&t=102" target="_blank">00:01:42.680</a></span> | <span class="t">strength training and the effective dose for conditioning at the bare minimum level, again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqt7qh5oq38&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.600</a></span> | <span class="t">being a much better performer conditioning wise, you're gonna want to do more than that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqt7qh5oq38&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And in terms of the duration of those workouts, what's your suggestion?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqt7qh5oq38&t=114" target="_blank">00:01:54.480</a></span> | <span

more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqt7qh5oq38&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">than 60 minutes or so, it's very hard for me to recover, I start getting colds, I start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqt7qh5oq38&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.720</a></span> |

<span class="t">But amazingly, at least to me, if I keep those workouts to about 10 minutes, 10 minutes of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqt7qh5oq38&t=138" target="_blank">00:02:18.120</a></span> | <span class="t">warm up and 50, five, zero minutes or so of really hard work for resistance training,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqt7qh5oq38&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and I keep the cardiovascular work to about 30 to 45 minutes, I feel great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqt7qh5oq38&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.360</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:02:34.100</a></span> | <span class="t">workout.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqt7qh5oq38&t=155" target="_blank">00:02:35.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I mean, it's those are good numbers, because those are kind of numbers that we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqt7qh5oq38&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">usually preach, we try to keep our workouts to an hour or less if possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqt7qh5oq38&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, depending upon the split that you're following, if you're on a total body split,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqt7qh5oq38&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.360</a></span> | <span class="t">there's just gonna be more that has to be done in a given amount of time that and again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqt7qh5oq38&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.080</a></span> | <span class="t">if you're training primarily for strength, that could prolong the workout because the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqt7qh5oq38&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.960</a></span> | <span class="t">longer rest times in between sets, but in general, when you're not focused on that one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqt7qh5oq38&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">aspect, but the overall health picture, then you can get the job done in under an under</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqt7qh5oq38&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.560</a></span> | <span class="t">an hour.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqt7qh5oq38&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, I always say, on top of if you want to look like an athlete train like an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqt7qh5oq38&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">athlete is you can either train longer, you can train hard, but you can't do both.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqt7qh5oq38&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And I really believe that the focus for me, I have a busy life, I have a lot of other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqt7qh5oq38&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.400</a></span> | <span class="t">things that I do, believe it or not, and it's like, I want to go hard, and I want to go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqt7qh5oq38&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.360</a></span> | <span class="t">get out.</span></div><div

particularly, as you start to get older, I think it's the it's the length of the workout</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqt7qh5oq38&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that actually causes more problems than the intensity of what you're doing, particularly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

integral</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqt7qh5oq38&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.840</a></span> | <span class="t">part of my workout than it

to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqt7qh5oq38&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.160</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of give myself a little bit of a warm up, the intensity is not what bothers me,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqt7qh5oq38&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.480</a></span> | <span
