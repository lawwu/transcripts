The source document to look at here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRdFG-Cpox4&t=30" target="_blank">00:00:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is the article I wrote for The New Yorker on TikTok. This probably came out,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRdFG-Cpox4&t=35" target="_blank">00:00:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">God, I don't know when this was, the summer, early fall.

Okay. Anyways, and I talked about it on the show, I believe at some point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRdFG-Cpox4&t=43" target="_blank">00:00:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, it was an article that came out of ideas we first introduced on the show. And basically,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRdFG-Cpox4&t=48" target="_blank">00:00:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">my premise was Facebook and Instagram following TikTok's lead to having more and more information</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRdFG-Cpox4&t=56" target="_blank">00:00:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">selected algorithmically and having no connection to people that you follow or to the things that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRdFG-Cpox4&t=61" target="_blank">00:01:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">people you follow shared.

The way I think about TikTok now, my shorthand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRdFG-Cpox4&t=76" target="_blank">00:01:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">for TikTok right now is that it's Blue's Clues for adults. So Blue's Clues is a children's program</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRdFG-Cpox4&t=86" target="_blank">00:01:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that became really popular in the 1990s. And I know about it because Malcolm Gladwell wrote a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRdFG-Cpox4&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">chapter about Blue's Clues in his seminal book, The Tipping Point. And what he argued in The</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRdFG-Cpox4&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Tipping Point is compare Blue's Clues to Sesame Street, and you see something very different.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRdFG-Cpox4&t=104" target="_blank">00:01:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, Sesame Street is legible to adults. You see what they're trying to do. It's educational</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRdFG-Cpox4&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">content. It has these interesting puppets. There's some in-jokes for the adults. It's funny. There's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRdFG-Cpox4&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">some good writing in it. And so they're trying to help children learn, but it's kind of an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRdFG-Cpox4&t=123" target="_blank">00:02:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">interestingly crafted thing. You can have it on as a grownup and not hate it. And it's a well-done</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRdFG-Cpox4&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">show. Blue's Clues, if you've ever seen this, baffles adults. It's repetitive. It makes no</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRdFG-Cpox4&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">sense.

They'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRdFG-Cpox4&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">just pause for a while. It seems insipid. It seems arbitrary. It seems almost nihilistic in its</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRdFG-Cpox4&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">incoherence. And it was incredibly popular. And what Malcolm Gladwell wrote about in The</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRdFG-Cpox4&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Tipping Point is what they did for that show was they basically studied kids and worked entirely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRdFG-Cpox4&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">off the metric of what grabs their attention and what doesn't. And so they built a whole TV show</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRdFG-Cpox4&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">around just the simple goal of how do I keep kids' attention on here? And the result was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRdFG-Cpox4&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">this incoherent to adults audio-visual assault mishmash. And there was actually a lot of this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRdFG-Cpox4&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">that arose in the '90s. Barney's gave way to Teletubbies, these shows that were so weird to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRdFG-Cpox4&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">adults. Sesame Street was funny. It'd be like, hey, here comes, you know, Stalker Channing is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRdFG-Cpox4&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">going to come on and do a skit with garbage, whatever his name was, Oscar the Grouch. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRdFG-Cpox4&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">it's about letters. And it's also kind of funny. And there's some good writing. And it's kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRdFG-Cpox4&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">winking at the audience. And then it's Teletubbies, your eyes are melting. It's Blue's Clues, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRdFG-Cpox4&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">what's going on? Why is it just staring at the screen, waiting for the kids to repeat a word</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRdFG-Cpox4&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">or whatever? And it's because it was engineered to be a simple metric, what's going to keep kids</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRdFG-Cpox4&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">looking. In the world of social media, Facebook and Instagram is Sesame Street. TikTok is Blue's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRdFG-Cpox4&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Clues. They got rid of any of the potentially good stuff, the connection to other people,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRdFG-Cpox4&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the seeing what people you know are up to, the expression, the discovery of interesting things,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRdFG-Cpox4&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and made it just what gets your eyes affixed to this as long as possible. And the result is this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRdFG-Cpox4&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">format that, again, to a non-TikTok user is incoherent, is mind melting. It's these weird,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRdFG-Cpox4&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">short videos with cuts and movements. And all it is is Blue's Clues. It is what happens when you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRdFG-Cpox4&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">push a content to its logical extreme in the context of attention maximization. And so just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRdFG-Cpox4&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.360</a></span> | <span class="t">like adults look at Blue's Clues, like, this feels just, I think a lot of adults look at TikTok,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRdFG-Cpox4&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">like, we're not even pretending anymore that this is unlocking the power of the web. It's just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRdFG-Cpox4&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the logical terminal space of when you're saying, let's just maximize eyes, eyes, eyes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRdFG-Cpox4&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so TikTok is Blue's Clues for adult. If Facebook and Instagram follow that path,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRdFG-Cpox4&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">they're getting rid of all the stuff that's quality. They're getting rid of all the potential</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRdFG-Cpox4&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.840</a></span> | <span class="t">value proposition of connecting the people you know, discovering things from people like you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRdFG-Cpox4&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and it just becomes what's going to keep my toddler slack jawed at the screen while I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRdFG-Cpox4&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">trying to get something done.

As I argued in that New Yorker piece, it is too hard</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRdFG-Cpox4&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">at this point to build a social graph of the same size and of the same value as a Twitter, Instagram,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRdFG-Cpox4&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">or Facebook. So any service that's mainly based on one of those social graphs is not able to compete</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRdFG-Cpox4&t=316" target="_blank">00:05:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">with those. But as soon as they move away from their social graph, here's friends and links,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRdFG-Cpox4&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and just to algorithmically select the content, they're just in the competitive mosh pit with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRdFG-Cpox4&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">everything else is trying to grab your attention. And Blue's Clues isn't on TV anymore, because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRdFG-Cpox4&t=329" target="_blank">00:05:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">there's other cartoons that came along or even more insipid and even more attention capturing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRdFG-Cpox4&t=334" target="_blank">00:05:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's why I think Allison, the move of Facebook and Instagram towards a Blue's Clues</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRdFG-Cpox4&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">TikTok model, maybe is trying to stave off some user, user loss in the short term, but is going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRdFG-Cpox4&t=347" target="_blank">00:05:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">to expose them to competition that they can't hope to win at long term.
