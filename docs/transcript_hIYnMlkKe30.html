The love of winning or the hatred of losing? - Tough question. Have to confess I never heard it before, which is again, congratulations, it's quite an accomplishment.</p><p>Losing was always painful. For me, it was almost like a physical pain because I knew that if I lost the game, it's just because I made a mistake. So I always believed that the result of the game had to be decided by the quality of my play. Okay, you may say it sounds arrogant, but it helped me to move forward because I always knew that there was room for improvement.</p><p>So it's the-- - Was there the fear of the mistake? - Actually, fear of mistake guarantees mistakes. And the difference between top players, the very top, is that it's the ability to make a decision without predictable consequences. You don't know what's happening. It's just intuitively, I can go this way or that way.</p><p>And there are always hesitations. People are like, you are just at the crossroad. You can go right, you can go left, you can go straight. You can turn and go back. And the consequences are just very uncertain. Yes, you have certain ideas what happens on the right or on the left, or just if you go straight, but it's not enough to make well-calculated choice.</p><p>And when you play chess at the very top, it's about your inner strength. So I can make this decision. I will stand firm, and I'm not going to waste my time because I have full confidence that I will go through. Now, going back to your original question is, I would say neither.</p><p>It's just, it's love for winning, hate for losing. They were important elements, psychological elements. But the key element, I would say the driving force was always my passion for making a difference. It's just, I can move forward, and I can always enjoy not just playing, but creating something new.</p><p>- Creating something new. How do you think about that? - It's just finding new ideas in the openings, some original plan in the middle game. Actually, that helped me to make the transition from the game of chess, where I was on the very top, to another life, where I knew I would not be number one.</p><p>I would not be necessarily on the top, but I could still be very active and productive by my ability to make the difference, by influencing people, say, joining the democratic movement in Russia, or talking to people about human-machine relations. There's so many things where I knew my influence may not be as decisive as in chess, but still strong enough to help people to make their choices.</p><p>So you can still create something new that makes a difference in the world outside of chess.
