change blindness, there's a famous example</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=555" target="_blank">00:09:15.140</a></span> | <span

reason is that you're generating these serious expectations about what's in front of you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=575"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=596" target="_blank">00:09:56.460</a></span> | <span class="t">It's all coming into play in terms of your sense of where you are,

question?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1243" target="_blank">00:20:43.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, this is a totally dumb

<span class="t">But I'll get to why we did that because that was, I think, the coolest part of the experiment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1256" target="_blank">00:20:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But let's first get back to the trivia question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1259" target="_blank">00:20:59.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So we found that when we looked at brain activity, when we give people the question, right afterwards,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1267" target="_blank">00:21:07.880</a></span> | <span class="t">there is a burst of activity throughout the so-called reward circuit of the brain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1274" target="_blank">00:21:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not really a reward circuit as we've discussed offline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1277" target="_blank">00:21:17.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It's really these areas of the brain that process the neurotransmitter dopamine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1281" target="_blank">00:21:21.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And unlike many other neuromodulators, this go all over the place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1284" target="_blank">00:21:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Dopamine is much more restricted in its effect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1287" target="_blank">00:21:27.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so in the midbrain near the ventral tegmental area, sorry, I'm geeking out on this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1293" target="_blank">00:21:33.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, we've talked about that in this podcast is a particular.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1295" target="_blank">00:21:35.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the key statement that you made that people should hold on to as we progress through this is that dopamine is not dumped everywhere.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1301" target="_blank">00:21:41.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not sprinklered all over the brain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1303" target="_blank">00:21:43.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It's released in fairly restricted sites in order to drive particular processes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1309" target="_blank">00:21:49.880</a></span> | <span class="t">That's right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1310" target="_blank">00:21:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that's sufficient for now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1311" target="_blank">00:21:51.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1312" target="_blank">00:21:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so when we look at functional MRI, we can't measure dopamine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1315" target="_blank">00:21:55.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But what we see is activity in the dopaminergic midbrain area, meaning the area of the brain around the midbrain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1322" target="_blank">00:22:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And you see it in the nucleus accumbens or what's called the ventral striatum,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1326" target="_blank">00:22:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">which is another area that's super high dopamine reward processing area.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1330" target="_blank">00:22:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">The more curious people are like on a one to six scale, the more activity you see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1336" target="_blank">00:22:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just like this beautiful relationship, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1339" target="_blank">00:22:19.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's not driven by the answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1342" target="_blank">00:22:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, there's a reason we probably didn't get it for the answer, but it's driven by the question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1346" target="_blank">00:22:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's not like they're like, oh, I learned something new.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1349" target="_blank">00:22:29.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like, I want to get this knowledge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1352" target="_blank">00:22:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's part one of the story.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1355" target="_blank">00:22:35.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Part two of the story is we show that face right after the question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1360" target="_blank">00:22:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And if people are curious to find the answer to the question,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1364" target="_blank">00:22:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">they get a bump in memory for the faces relative to if they're not curious.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1370" target="_blank">00:22:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, the faces have nothing to do with the trivia question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1373" target="_blank">00:22:53.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's being in that curious state that drives this dopaminergic activity in the midbrain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1380" target="_blank">00:23:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's a whole lot of other studies findings from that study.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1383" target="_blank">00:23:03.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But basically, I think, you know, sometimes you do a lot of studies and published like 180 studies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1391" target="_blank">00:23:11.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's like I'm trying to remember the exact.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1393" target="_blank">00:23:13.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it was like functional connectivity between the hippocampus and the red brain during the face was predicting better memory for these faces in general.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1404" target="_blank">00:23:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Something like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1405" target="_blank">00:23:25.880</a></span> | <span class="t">We can put a link to the paper, of course, in the show note captions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1408" target="_blank">00:23:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So let me make sure I understand that the when people are prompted with a question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1412" target="_blank">00:23:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1413" target="_blank">00:23:33.880</a></span> | <span class="t">That drives the release of dopamine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1414" target="_blank">00:23:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1415" target="_blank">00:23:35.880</a></span> | <span class="t">The amount of dopamine is proportional to how curious they are to get the answer to that particular question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1420" target="_blank">00:23:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the dopamine itself, if elevated because they are very curious, can increase the probability that they will remember the answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1431" target="_blank">00:23:51.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It creates a milieu, an environment for better memory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1435" target="_blank">00:23:55.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But that can confuse us and make us think that dopamine improves our memory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1439" target="_blank">00:23:59.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's that curiosity increases dopamine, which increases the capacity to store information that comes subsequent to curiosity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1447" target="_blank">00:24:07.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Beautiful synopsis, but I'll do two cheerful amendments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1451" target="_blank">00:24:11.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So one is technically we're not measuring dopamine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1455" target="_blank">00:24:15.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So I have to be very clear about that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1456" target="_blank">00:24:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">This is bold signal, meaning it's, you know, metabolic activity, but it's following all the usual suspects of where you'd expect it to be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1465" target="_blank">00:24:25.880</a></span> | <span class="t">The second thing is I do think that dopamine is playing a part.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1470" target="_blank">00:24:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And I mean, it definitely facilitates plasticity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1473" target="_blank">00:24:33.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So I do think it helps in learning the answer for sure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1477" target="_blank">00:24:37.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's a whole theory called synaptic tagging, which basically says that if you just release a bunch of dopamine,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1483" target="_blank">00:24:43.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and then you have these potentiated synapses, that you can drive plasticity in those synapses, even if it's not happening at the same time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1490" target="_blank">00:24:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But what's really cool is the face has nothing to do with the trivia question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1496" target="_blank">00:24:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">The theory that we have is when you get that bump in dopamine activity, you're motivated, you're energized to get the answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1503" target="_blank">00:25:03.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And you're driven towards the state of plasticity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1506" target="_blank">00:25:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And now I've given you something that has nothing to do with this question and boom, you got it, you know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1512" target="_blank">00:25:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So when people ask me and they ask me a lot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1515" target="_blank">00:25:15.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

relationships, but she said that one of the most sustaining factors for romantic relationships over long periods of time is a sense of curiosity, both about the other person, but also about oneself and how one changes in the context of the relationship.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1640" target="_blank">00:27:20.880</a></span>

into the present to anticipate the future.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1707" target="_blank">00:28:27.880</a></span> | <span

all, I want to be careful and not to say dopamine does this because it's a trap, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1719" target="_blank">00:28:39.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, to be clear, you observed heightened activity in a dopaminergic circuit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1724" target="_blank">00:28:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1725" target="_blank">00:28:45.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So the idea that it would not involve dopamine is a bit of a stretch, but you didn't directly show that it was dopamine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1731" target="_blank">00:28:51.880</a></span> | <span

say that assigning a single function to a chemical is, you know, risky.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1738" target="_blank">00:28:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But that said, I do believe there's a link.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1741" target="_blank">00:29:01.880</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the things that you see is in Parkinson's disease, dopaminergic neurotransmitter mission is shot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1747" target="_blank">00:29:07.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And depression is also a symptom of Parkinson's disease.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1750" target="_blank">00:29:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It's quite a severe one, in fact.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1753" target="_blank">00:29:13.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what I think one theory goes is that dopamine energizes us to seek rewards or to seek information, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1762" target="_blank">00:29:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So a big part of movement is you move to get something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1766" target="_blank">00:29:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It's approach, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1768" target="_blank">00:29:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">They talk about approach and avoidance as basic kind of things that you want to program.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1773" target="_blank">00:29:33.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so a person with Parkinson's disease has a problem with willful movement, tremors and stuff too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1779" target="_blank">00:29:39.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think that dopamine is involved in this kind of energizing you to move.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1786" target="_blank">00:29:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's involved in energizing you to seek information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1790" target="_blank">00:29:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's involved in energizing you to seek rewards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1794" target="_blank">00:29:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I do think there's some kind of a common pathway there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1798" target="_blank">00:29:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And it speaks to this issue of the difference which you've talked about and I talk about a lot as wanting versus liking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1805" target="_blank">00:30:05.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so Kent Barrage at Michigan has a great work on this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1808" target="_blank">00:30:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Gobs and gobs of manipulations of dopamine activity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1812" target="_blank">00:30:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And what he finds is an animal, let's say, that is deprived of dopamine, it will go for rewards just fine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1820" target="_blank">00:30:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It just won't work for them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1822" target="_blank">00:30:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It won't do the work that you need to get a reward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1825" target="_blank">00:30:25.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you just put it in front of them, they'll take it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1827" target="_blank">00:30:27.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So what dopamine, it is heavily involved with these opioid systems that does drive reward responses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1835" target="_blank">00:30:35.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's heavily involved in learning about rewards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1838" target="_blank">00:30:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's why you get a big dopaminergic bump when an animal gets a reward</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1843" target="_blank">00:30:43.880</a></span> | <span class="t">because you're learning about the reward and what predicted the reward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1846" target="_blank">00:30:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a little bit of a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1855" target="_blank">00:30:55.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a beautiful work where he's looked at trace conditioning, which is when you have like a – let's say if you play a tone and you wait a long time and then the animal gets a shock, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1865" target="_blank">00:31:05.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what you find is that the animal learns to be afraid of the tone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1871" target="_blank">00:31:11.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's such a long time in his thing, I think it's on the order of 10 seconds or above, the animal has to be somehow doing something to be able to blame that tone for getting shocked, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1884" target="_blank">00:31:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what he found was that there's this burst of dopamine activity in the locus coeruleus, which is actually known for norepinephrine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1893"

large brain areas with epinephrine, which is – or norepinephrine, noradrenaline for alertness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1915" target="_blank">00:31:55.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So somewhat distinct from the dopamine system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

happening is – and he's studying this now – but what seems to be happening is it's not that the animal is going, "Oh, I just heard a tone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1932" target="_blank">00:32:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I heard a tone."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

reward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1954" target="_blank">00:32:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It's really kind of, you know, the next time you hear that tone, you might – if it were a real threat, you could actually escape from it, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1962" target="_blank">00:32:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's this whole active avoidance literature that you can look at with these

that it's mobilizing you, I think.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=1987" target="_blank">00:33:07.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I'd

a demanding life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2014" target="_blank">00:33:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">For me, even if I eat mostly whole foods and minimally processed foods, which I do for most of my food intake, it's very difficult for me to get enough fruits and vegetables, vitamins and minerals, micronutrients, and adaptogens from food alone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2026" target="_blank">00:33:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">For that

<span class="t">One thing that we talked about just briefly earlier was this non-sleep deep rest protocol that in yoga tradition is called yoga nidra or yoga sleep because you lie down, it's self-directed relaxation, long exhale breathing to slow your heart rate, et cetera, et cetera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2077" target="_blank">00:34:37.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I called it an NSDR, not to appropriate it, but because the language of yoga nidra is a little bit of a separator for people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2083" target="_blank">00:34:43.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It sounds a little bit esoteric, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2085" target="_blank">00:34:45.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And non-sleep deep rest tells you what it is, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2088" target="_blank">00:34:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a study at the University of Copenhagen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2091" target="_blank">00:34:51.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I can try to link to it in the show note captions, and I'd love your thoughts on it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2094" target="_blank">00:34:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">They show that people who do this practice, this is a PET imaging study.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2098" target="_blank">00:34:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So positron emission tomography for those that don't know, and they see significant increases in striatal dopamine in the condition of people that do this self-directed relaxation as opposed to a more traditional meditation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2111" target="_blank">00:35:11.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is why I say that NSDR is useful for restoring mental and physical vigor, which translates to this idea that dopamine prepares us for or is a reservoir for potential movement, typically toward rewards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2124" target="_blank">00:35:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And I love that we're talking about some of the other facets of dopamine because all too often people think about it as pleasure or motivation, and certainly it's involved in motivation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2134" target="_blank">00:35:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm very happy to learn that it's also involved in learning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2139" target="_blank">00:35:39.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, seriously.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2140" target="_blank">00:35:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a novel perspective on dopamine, and we hear so much about dopamine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2145" target="_blank">00:35:45.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you think that when dopamine is released as a consequence of curiosity in a way that primes the memory system that we become entrenched in particular behaviors or routes of pursuing curiosity to the exclusion of others?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2163" target="_blank">00:36:03.880</a></span> | <span class="t">What I'm thinking about here as a kid, we've seen these data, kids with ADHD actually have terrific ability to focus if it's something that they're really excited about, really curious about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2173" target="_blank">00:36:13.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2174" target="_blank">00:36:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So you give a kid with ADHD who loves video games, a video game, and they're like a laser.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2177" target="_blank">00:36:17.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2178" target="_blank">00:36:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's not that they lack the capacity to focus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2180" target="_blank">00:36:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2181" target="_blank">00:36:21.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It's that they have a harder time dropping into focus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2183" target="_blank">00:36:23.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2184" target="_blank">00:36:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But it seems that because of the learning dimension to dopamine, that these circuits could potentially, quote unquote, learn that it's video games that provides that feeling of focus to the exclusion of other things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2196" target="_blank">00:36:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Meaning how does one keep a diversification of inputs to the dopamine system so that we're continually driving dopamine through lots of different things as opposed to just social media or just video games or just pick your favorite thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2213" target="_blank">00:36:53.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Because becoming a functional human being involves the requirement to focus on many things, not just the things we were curious about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2220" target="_blank">00:37:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2221"

target="_blank">00:37:03.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2224" target="_blank">00:37:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2225" target="_blank">00:37:05.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, to me, I talk about this a little bit in the book, but to me, and if you look at the literature too, you can see this, a big part of being curious is the appraisal process, so to speak.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2233" target="_blank">00:37:13.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And what I mean by that is saying something happens, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2237" target="_blank">00:37:17.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's say something in your environment happens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2239" target="_blank">00:37:19.880</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're going to, you have a decision to make, is this interesting?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2243" target="_blank">00:37:23.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Is this important?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2244" target="_blank">00:37:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Is this scary?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2245" target="_blank">00:37:25.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think the thing is, is that you need to be open to that possibility that it's interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2251" target="_blank">00:37:31.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So let me just give you an example that I often give.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2257" target="_blank">00:37:37.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's say you're walking in a neighborhood, you're traveling like you do for many of your events, and you walk into a new neighborhood you haven't been to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2265"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2269" target="_blank">00:37:49.880</a></span> | <span class="t">You could be like, well, that's a gunshot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2271" target="_blank">00:37:51.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I better hide or I better run.</span></div><div class="c"><span

a cool band playing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2277" target="_blank">00:37:57.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I should go check

critical for how you respond.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2283" target="_blank">00:38:03.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it's not just a matter of curiosity happens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2287" target="_blank">00:38:07.880</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:38:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, I mean, this is, I think, you know, I'm not a wellness guru or anything, but it's like, I think this is one of the cool things about mindfulness training is it forces you to take the mundane and be curious about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2307"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2448" target="_blank">00:40:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It looks a little bit like a seahorse, although the anatomist had a little bit of an imagination there, in my opinion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2453" target="_blank">00:40:53.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But hippocampus, let's add to it prefrontal cortex, which you've already mentioned, and then these neuromodulatory systems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2462" target="_blank">00:41:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So if we were going to assign a one-sentence definition, functional definition to each of those areas, what would you say the hippocampus does?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2471" target="_blank">00:41:11.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, first of all, I'll add a whole lot of other neocortical areas we could talk about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2475" target="_blank">00:41:15.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's add those in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2476" target="_blank">00:41:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think if you can start with three, I think then folks can digest it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2479" target="_blank">00:41:19.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div

arguably, except for maybe V1.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2486" target="_blank">00:41:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Visual cortex, V1.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2487" target="_blank">00:41:27.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div

paper with the late Howard Eichenbaum and Andy Onlinas on this from Davis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2499" target="_blank">00:41:39.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And we believe that it's about linking various experiences to a context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2505" target="_blank">00:41:45.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And what I mean by that is you've got information about smell, high-level vision, high-level semantic knowledge information, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2514" target="_blank">00:41:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And the hippocampus' wiring is really set up to not understand what's going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2520" target="_blank">00:42:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So the late David Marr, who's a pioneer in computational neuroscience, proposed that what the hippocampus is about is what he called simple memory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2527" target="_blank">00:42:07.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It's basically saying, I know Andy Huberman.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2531" target="_blank">00:42:11.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Sorry.</span></div><div

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2534" target="_blank">00:42:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, long story.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2535" target="_blank">00:42:15.880</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the Davis thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2536" target="_blank">00:42:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">You would understand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2537" target="_blank">00:42:17.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So I know Andy Huberman, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2541" target="_blank">00:42:21.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But to have a memory of this moment that's separate from, let's say, I saw you at some neuroscience retreat when you were in grad school,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2551" target="_blank">00:42:31.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I have to have some part of the brain that doesn't know who you are to some extent, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2556" target="_blank">00:42:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Because I've got to keep them separate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2558" target="_blank">00:42:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the hippocampus, what it will do is it will form a memory that's not an Andy Huberman memory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2565" target="_blank">00:42:45.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It's an Andy in this place, at this time, in this context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2571" target="_blank">00:42:51.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's what allows it to support what's called episodic memory, which is your ability to say, I went to Washington DC once and I remember going to the Smithsonian, as opposed to your knowledge about what generally happens in Washington DC.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2586" target="_blank">00:43:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, the president's there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2587" target="_blank">00:43:07.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, that's where a lot of politics happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2589" target="_blank">00:43:09.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, the Smithsonian is a place in DC.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2593" target="_blank">00:43:13.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a memory of your being there at a particular place and time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2598" target="_blank">00:43:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, there's other parts of the brain that allow you to associate that information in a meaningful way and to be able to actually expand on that context and create these narratives and these stories about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2613" target="_blank">00:43:33.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And where the prefrontal cortex comes in, and it's a huge area, it's about one third of the primate brain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2620" target="_blank">00:43:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's just massive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2622" target="_blank">00:43:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">There are a lot of people who go, well, there's no real, there's a bunch of different areas and I'll do different things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2627" target="_blank">00:43:47.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And I subscribe to the view that that is very true.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2630" target="_blank">00:43:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And at the same time, there's a global function of the prefrontal cortex, which is what's called cognitive control.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2638" target="_blank">00:43:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It's this ability to say, I'm going to regulate my movements and I'm going to regulate my perceptions and my thoughts based on what's important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2649" target="_blank">00:44:09.880</a></span> | <span class="t">to me in terms of this higher order goal, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2653" target="_blank">00:44:13.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So when I've tested, for instance, patients with prefrontal lesions, I'm sure Mark Desposito talked to you about this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2660" target="_blank">00:44:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like the hallmark of them, you know, they used to say, well, the prefrontal cortex, it's important for working memory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2665" target="_blank">00:44:25.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And you could record from neurons in the prefrontal cortex or look at fMRI signal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2670" target="_blank">00:44:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And if a person or an animal is holding something in their mind, like a phone number, neurons or bold signal in MRI will be highly elevated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2681" target="_blank">00:44:41.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Their activity will be elevated throughout this period of time where they're holding in mind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2686" target="_blank">00:44:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But it turns out if you just ask somebody with a major prefrontal lesion, here's a bunch of numbers, five, two, seven, eight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2695" target="_blank">00:44:55.880</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I ask you to tell them back to me in right order.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2697" target="_blank">00:44:57.880</a></span> | <span class="t">They can do it just fine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2699" target="_blank">00:44:59.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But now I start to distract them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2701" target="_blank">00:45:01.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I move my hands around.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2702" target="_blank">00:45:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a plane going on, you know, flying outside the window.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2705" target="_blank">00:45:05.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And I had that literally happen once.</span></div><div

controlled by their goal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2713" target="_blank">00:45:13.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It's controlled by the environment around them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2716" target="_blank">00:45:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this is where things get really interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2719" target="_blank">00:45:19.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So I once tested a patient.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2721" target="_blank">00:45:21.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'd heard about this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2722" target="_blank">00:45:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But until you see it, it like doesn't register.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2726" target="_blank">00:45:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It really blew my mind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2727" target="_blank">00:45:27.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's a test called the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2732" target="_blank">00:45:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And we don't have to get into all the details of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2734" target="_blank">00:45:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But basically it's this test where people learn some rule about where to put a card on a table, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2740" target="_blank">00:45:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And they don't get told the rule.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2742"

target="_blank">00:45:43.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And patients learn this prefrontal damage, learn it just fine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=2746" target="_blank">00:45:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Is it that they get a error signal or a correct signal if they're doing it in the

target="_blank">00:51:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And the short answer is bad for memory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

your funnel function is not going to be as good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3119" target="_blank">00:51:59.880</a></span> | <span

<span class="t">And so that scrolling is going to be more potent because as you pointed out, the algorithms are all designed to suck up our attention.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3132" target="_blank">00:52:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So psychologist Herb Simon came up with this beautiful term called the attention economy, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3138" target="_blank">00:52:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the idea is that the more information that you have in front of you, the more impoverished you are in terms of your attention.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3144" target="_blank">00:52:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's no such thing as free speech because it's like you have a limited supply of attention.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3148" target="_blank">00:52:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So everything has a cost.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3150" target="_blank">00:52:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the more information you have in front of you, the harder it is to pay attention to what's important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3156" target="_blank">00:52:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's where I think the older adults really lose some of their functioning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3161" target="_blank">00:52:41.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Because basically I talk about in the book, and it's not a perfect analogy, is neurons are functioning kind of like a democracy in the sense that, you know, real democracies involve these political coalitions or alliances, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3175" target="_blank">00:52:55.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, people talk about the right and the left, but that's dumb because it's just alliances between people who like different things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3182" target="_blank">00:53:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And they just form these convenient alliances with each other, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3185" target="_blank">00:53:05.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But let's just imagine neurons kind of do this in the brain, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3188" target="_blank">00:53:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you have, in theory, to be able to pay attention to something, some coalition of neurons has to be firing a lot that is corresponding to the thing that you're trying to pay attention to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3203" target="_blank">00:53:23.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But if something is salient, bright, shiny, loud, it's just grabbing your attention, what's going to happen is that those neurons start to shout down the neurons that are trying to keep you on what's not shiny.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3217" target="_blank">00:53:37.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's important, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3219" target="_blank">00:53:39.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what happens is, with the prefrontal cortex, you can bias that competition, that's the term that people have used in literature, that allows you...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3228" target="_blank">00:53:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So what people have found, for instance, is just a really cool finding, again, is you can find in the visual cortex neurons that fire when you're seeing something red, neurons that fire when you see something blue, let's say, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3239" target="_blank">00:53:59.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm kind of distorting the picture, but you get the idea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3242" target="_blank">00:54:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So if an animal is trying to hold in mind something, I'd say, hold on a mental picture of something that's blue, what happens is the blue neurons are firing in the visual cortex, even though the animal's not seeing blue, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3256" target="_blank">00:54:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just they're thinking about blue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3258" target="_blank">00:54:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">You damage the prefrontal cortex, nothing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3261" target="_blank">00:54:21.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So you lose that selectivity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3263" target="_blank">00:54:23.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So what's happening is the prefrontal cortex is biasing the competition and saying, I know blue's not shining in front of you, there's no shiny blue thing in front of you right now, but I need these neurons to stay active.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3276" target="_blank">00:54:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it's doing this modulation to help out the neurons that are keeping the information that's goal relevant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3283" target="_blank">00:54:43.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So what happens when that communication goes, let's say due to hypertension, diabetes, you get all this white matter damage that happens with old age.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3292" target="_blank">00:54:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is really a big thing that is very preventable with the right protocols, so to speak.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3297" target="_blank">00:54:57.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll just bring that white matter are the fiber tracks, the wires that essentially that connect neurons across long and short distances.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3305" target="_blank">00:55:05.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Exactly. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3306" target="_blank">00:55:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so if you damage those long range tracks, the prefrontal cortex is not efficiently able to bias that competition.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3315" target="_blank">00:55:15.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so now the inane gets remembered at the expense of the important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3320" target="_blank">00:55:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">That's that's, I think, the key thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3323" target="_blank">00:55:23.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And a lot of that's why people talk about the prefrontal cortex as the central executive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3329" target="_blank">00:55:29.880</a></span> | <span class="t">As anybody who's worked a job knows, it's like the executives are useless, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3333" target="_blank">00:55:33.880</a></span> | <span class="t">You try to get an executive to do, I mean, except for some who are useful, but then they don't really run companies very well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3339" target="_blank">00:55:39.880</a></span> | <span class="t">There's some CEOs that are doing spectacular things, but.</span></div><div

to micromanage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3353" target="_blank">00:55:53.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Their job is to say, here's the big picture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3355" target="_blank">00:55:55.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's my vision for the company.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3357" target="_blank">00:55:57.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And I want everyone to be working towards this goal, not, you know, sifting through the mail room, not paying the bills.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3364" target="_blank">00:56:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3365" target="_blank">00:56:05.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what happens is, is that when you have certain kinds of things that happen with aging, like damage to the white matter that happens through essentially tiny cerebrovascular events,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3376" target="_blank">00:56:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">most likely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3377" target="_blank">00:56:17.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And we've done some research on this in our lab in collaboration with Bill Jagus, who's now in Berkeley, and Charlie DeCarly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3384" target="_blank">00:56:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can measure this in MRIs with a measure called white matter hyperintensities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3390" target="_blank">00:56:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">You use a scan that shows up little bright spots where the white matter is probably damaged.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3395" target="_blank">00:56:35.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And what you find is, is that these people with white matter hyperintensities actually have memory performance that's as poor as people who have hippocampal atrophy, probably in the earliest stages of Alzheimer's.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3409" target="_blank">00:56:49.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And they're also bad at controlling information, even when they don't have to remember something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3415" target="_blank">00:56:55.880</a></span> | <span

the executive is trapped in, you know, a remote place and they got no internet access and no phone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3423" target="_blank">00:57:03.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so they can't communicate with the company as everybody's just doing their own thing, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3428" target="_blank">00:57:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's a little bit

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3735" target="_blank">01:02:15.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, what they said is there's six lifestyle factors that we're going to investigate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3739" target="_blank">01:02:19.880</a></span> | <span class="t">One was, I think, engagement in cognitive activities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3744" target="_blank">01:02:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I think one was social engagement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3746" target="_blank">01:02:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">One was physical exercise, not smoking, I think no alcohol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3752" target="_blank">01:02:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But they identified these lifestyle factors that were basically just kind of good lifestyle factors, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3758" target="_blank">01:02:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So they get people who have four to six of these lifestyle factors going versus zero to one of these lifestyle factors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3765" target="_blank">01:02:45.880</a></span> | <span

factors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3780" target="_blank">01:03:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Wow, so these are people exercising, paying attention to their sleep, social engagement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3785" target="_blank">01:03:05.880</a></span> | <span class="t">What are some of the other, I'm guessing low inflammatory diet?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3789" target="_blank">01:03:09.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, yeah, definitely not smoking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3791" target="_blank">01:03:11.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And smoking and alcohol, I think were big ones.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3796" target="_blank">01:03:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">The smoking one is interesting because we know smoking can cause cancer

class="t">Although there are some data, as I understand, that nicotine itself, not smoking, vaping, dipping, or snuffing, but that nicotine can be pro-cognition and maybe even pro-memory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3816" target="_blank">01:03:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And nowadays, people are

a big proponent of this because of the blood pressure increase and the typical routes of administration are dangerous.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

and get most of one's food from non-processed or minimally processed sources.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3856"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3872" target="_blank">01:04:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Olive oil, fruits, vegetables, fish, eggs, limited amounts of meat.</span></div><div

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3881" target="_blank">01:04:41.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3882" target="_blank">01:04:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Which I think, you know, is, let me come back to this point because I think it's super important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3886" target="_blank">01:04:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But leafy greens were a big one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3888" target="_blank">01:04:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">They pointed out a Rush Presbyterian study that I didn't know about that put people on, I think it was called the DASH diet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3894" target="_blank">01:04:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And it included leafy greens as a big part of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3898" target="_blank">01:04:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And that had a dramatic increase in cognitive, I mean, dramatically preserved cognitive performance in people who were on that diet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3907" target="_blank">01:05:07.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So the healthy diet is a big part.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3909" target="_blank">01:05:09.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, nicotine is interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3911" target="_blank">01:05:11.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you notice, a lot of people with schizophrenia smoke.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3914" target="_blank">01:05:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of the things that's been found is that nicotine does seem to improve functioning in people, cognitive functioning in people with schizophrenia.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3923" target="_blank">01:05:23.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I think the big thing to remember about any kind of drug, and this goes for food effects probably too, but especially drugs, is there's huge individual differences.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3937" target="_blank">01:05:37.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Huge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3938" target="_blank">01:05:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, I mean, just to give you an example, I could not function without that coffee that I had this morning and then coming in here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3945" target="_blank">01:05:45.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But my daughter would not be functional after those cups of coffee.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3950" target="_blank">01:05:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Some people really are affected by these different things differently.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3954" target="_blank">01:05:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, of course, there's always a dose response curve.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3956" target="_blank">01:05:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And they often follow these inverted U's.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3958" target="_blank">01:05:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So Mark Desposito, who was my postdoc mentor, did a lot of work with dopaminergic drugs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3964" target="_blank">01:06:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And a lot of people who had done these drug studies early on on cognition, they would find no effects or sometimes it would make people worse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3973" target="_blank">01:06:13.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And what he found was that if you looked more carefully, there was an inverted U effect where some people, and it depended on their working memory capacity, were actually benefiting from the drug.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3984" target="_blank">01:06:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And then these other people who were, let's say, I can't remember if it was higher or lower, were doing worse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3989" target="_blank">01:06:29.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's a genetic component to that, unsurprisingly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3992" target="_blank">01:06:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Dopamine transporters play a role and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=3994" target="_blank">01:06:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so now you start to get into all of these gene, environment, drug interactions that are just – I would really caution people against saying nicotine is good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4006" target="_blank">01:06:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Nicotine is bad.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4007" target="_blank">01:06:47.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it really, really is a much more complex issue, just like marijuana, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4012" target="_blank">01:06:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can look at smoking weed in adolescence for people who are at high genetic risk for psychosis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4020" target="_blank">01:07:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It dramatically increases your risk for psychosis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4022" target="_blank">01:07:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">That's my understanding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4023" target="_blank">01:07:03.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4024" target="_blank">01:07:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Although the times I've said that on the internet, I caught a lot of pushback from some of the cannabis researchers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4029" target="_blank">01:07:09.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But then having invited one of them on this podcast, I then got subsequent input from other researchers, which counter their narrative, which we can both say because we're both research scientists.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4041" target="_blank">01:07:21.880</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what you call a field.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4043" target="_blank">01:07:23.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div

said in the end of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4047" target="_blank">01:07:27.880</a></span> | <span class="t">No, no, no, you didn't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4048" target="_blank">01:07:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">You didn't.</span></div><div

there are certain individuals for whom high THC consumption can trigger psychotic episodes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4057" target="_blank">01:07:37.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, and we're seeing this with –</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4058" target="_blank">01:07:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But not everyone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4059" target="_blank">01:07:39.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4060" target="_blank">01:07:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean we're now interestingly seeing this with psychedelics where it's like all these positive effects of psychedelics are being brought up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4068" target="_blank">01:07:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But a lot of people remember the negative effects on people like Rocky Erickson from the 13th floor elevators or like Sid Barrett from Pink Floyd who became psychotic after doing large amounts of LSD.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4080" target="_blank">01:08:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">What was the first example?</span></div><div class="c"><span

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4084" target="_blank">01:08:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Great psychedelic band.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4085" target="_blank">01:08:05.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, psychedelic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4086" target="_blank">01:08:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4087" target="_blank">01:08:07.880</a></span> | <span class="t">We'll talk more about – Charn is himself a rock and roll musician and loves rock and roll, hence the reference to Rick Rubin earlier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4094" target="_blank">01:08:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's a photo of Rick here in the studio that our photographer Mike Blayback took.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4099" target="_blank">01:08:19.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So we were looking at that together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4101" target="_blank">01:08:21.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So yes, psychedelics have claimed the minds of certain people, helped contribute to their pre-existing presumably psychosis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4109" target="_blank">01:08:29.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I should also say in fairness to the other compounds out there, methamphetamines have also significantly contributed to the progression of psychosis in many people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4119" target="_blank">01:08:39.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's not just psychedelics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4120" target="_blank">01:08:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4121" target="_blank">01:08:41.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4122" target="_blank">01:08:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And then of course there are those who have somehow managed to take psychedelics and become more sane.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4127" target="_blank">01:08:47.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4128" target="_blank">01:08:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Or at least remain as sane as they were before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4131" target="_blank">01:08:51.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4132" target="_blank">01:08:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And of course sanity is in the eye of the beholder too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4134" target="_blank">01:08:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But what I'll say is that, yeah, and you can see this actually, there's some new concern about Adderall and stimulants.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4141" target="_blank">01:09:01.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you're giving it to people who might be at high risk for schizophrenia, it might also promote psychosis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4147" target="_blank">01:09:07.880</a></span> | <span class="t">That makes sense given the noradrenergic dopaminergic involvement in schizophrenia and those drugs are pro noradrenergic dopaminergic in general.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4155" target="_blank">01:09:15.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, yeah, exactly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4156" target="_blank">01:09:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Exactly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4157" target="_blank">01:09:17.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's really a much more complicated interaction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4160" target="_blank">01:09:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think this is where this whole realm of personalized medicine will be super helpful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4164" target="_blank">01:09:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But there does seem to be a broad general effect for certain dietary interventions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4172" target="_blank">01:09:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Berries seem to be good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4173"

target="_blank">01:09:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">We talked about the exercise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4177" target="_blank">01:09:37.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4178" target="_blank">01:09:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And my understanding, I've been looking at this in detail lately, but I'd love your thoughts, is that while everybody we now believe, men, women, et cetera, should do both cardiovascular exercise, so to speak, elevate heart rate for 12 to 60 minutes kind of thing, depending on the intensity, as well as resistance training to maintain neuromuscular function, offset sarcopenia, et cetera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4198" target="_blank">01:09:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">To me, the really impressive effects of exercise on learning capacity and the brain in terms of brain health seem to come from cardiovascular exercise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4209" target="_blank">01:10:09.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And that could just be because that's what's been emphasized in the studies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4212" target="_blank">01:10:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div

best human studies, it really does seem like getting blood flow up to the brain, getting a nice release of neuromodulators into the brain facilitates learning.</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4227" target="_blank">01:10:27.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, of course, people have to do something with that learning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4229" target="_blank">01:10:29.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Mm-hmm.</span></div><div

work with certain people if they talk slowly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4839" target="_blank">01:20:39.880</a></span> | <span

my troubles with motivation and getting things done that I don't want to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4899" target="_blank">01:21:39.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm kind of infamous for having trouble getting things done that I don't want to do in terms of like administrative tasks and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4906" target="_blank">01:21:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">You're a real

true.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4908" target="_blank">01:21:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I guess.</span></div><div

I'm willing to call out as, you know, what are they doing in science?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4916" target="_blank">01:21:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Because that's like you're supposed to be focusing on experiments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4919" target="_blank">01:21:59.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So, bravo.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4920" target="_blank">01:22:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So values then motivation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4923" target="_blank">01:22:03.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4924" target="_blank">01:22:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So basically it's like, so then I put the two together and I said, I'm not giving myself credit for why I'm doing this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4932" target="_blank">01:22:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So this goes back to the whole – I mean in a way it goes back to the prefrontal cortex conversation is what's my goal?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4938" target="_blank">01:22:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">If I'm going to see someone and have a meeting and I don't feel like going to the meeting because I'm tired and I'm bored or I want to just look at this YouTube video</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4947" target="_blank">01:22:27.880</a></span> | <span class="t">or I want to go on social media or whatever dumb thing that I waste my time on, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4952" target="_blank">01:22:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I say to myself, well, why am I doing this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4954" target="_blank">01:22:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And I remind myself of that motivation and it kicks everything in gear because now I have that goal in place because the goal just doesn't pop up for me automatically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4964" target="_blank">01:22:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so relating what I do to values is a game changer for me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4969" target="_blank">01:22:49.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's a conscious thing that I have to work on to remind myself of those values and connect them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4976" target="_blank">01:22:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's part of what I think people lose when they retire for instance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4981" target="_blank">01:23:01.880</a></span>

target="_blank">01:23:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">They feel like work is their only purpose.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4987" target="_blank">01:23:07.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so afterwards they feel purposeless and then they're just doing things like doom scrolling or being radicalized on the internet or like going into –</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=4998" target="_blank">01:23:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">but it's just like whatever captures their attention.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=5002" target="_blank">01:23:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think – so a big part of that sense of purpose for me has really been to get in touch with what do I really want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=5010" target="_blank">01:23:30.880</a></span> | <span

beautiful thing that you did with that, one of them, was that you said assume that you will forget.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=5071" target="_blank">01:24:31.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Because if you go back to the earliest research on memory by Ebbinghaus, he tested himself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=5077" target="_blank">01:24:37.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And he actually – he created these weird words called trigrams that weren't really words.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=5081"

target="_blank">01:24:43.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And what he found was within 20 minutes, he had forgotten about half of what he memorized.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=5089" target="_blank">01:24:49.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Within – and I don't mean just forgotten like he couldn't bring it to mind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=5094" target="_blank">01:24:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It took him as long to re-memorize them as it was if he had never done it, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=5099" target="_blank">01:24:59.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So sometimes we have partial memory where we can't recall it but we get some savings and it's easier for us to learn.</span></div><div

encounter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=5123" target="_blank">01:25:23.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But the details, we lose

right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=5214" target="_blank">01:26:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's where the prefrontal

moments of these events.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=5564" target="_blank">01:32:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And you have

shifts your attentional focus and shifts your understanding of what's going on, you see this big peak in activation in the hippocampus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=5587" target="_blank">01:33:07.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And what that seems to be related to is encoding a memory for what happened up to that point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=5592" target="_blank">01:33:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we call that an

an event boundary, it turns out like you go on to the next event and you have trouble remembering the stuff that happened right before the event boundary.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=5604" target="_blank">01:33:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It's why people end up in the kitchen and they're like, "What was my reason for

passed through three different rooms and their sense of where they were was changing, their mental context updated to the point where now they have to work to figure it out.</span></div><div

this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=5643" target="_blank">01:34:03.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div

<span class="t">And so you can use the phone, and this is where the studies show good effects, is if I mindfully use the phone and I say, like, there's something here that will be a good cue that will

target="_blank">01:39:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I use the camera not as a way of spreading my attention and just grabbing everything in this shotgun approach, but rather use it to find what's distinctive and what's important and actually focus me on it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=5999"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6024" target="_blank">01:40:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And these are not things that are like landmarks.</span></div><div class="c"><span

cues.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6032" target="_blank">01:40:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what happens is the next part of it is seeing the picture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6036" target="_blank">01:40:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, what do you do when you see the picture, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6038" target="_blank">01:40:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you scroll right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6039" target="_blank">01:40:39.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Or do you use it as a cue to effectively test yourself to recall what happened during that event and integrate it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6047" target="_blank">01:40:47.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, what's interesting is that act of recollecting the event in itself will change the memory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6053" target="_blank">01:40:53.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And it can make it more accessible, but it can also make it a little bit more abstract and story-like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6059" target="_blank">01:40:59.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there is an interesting trade-off where you have these things where you have these memories and you could even document it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6065" target="_blank">01:41:05.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you use the – if the more you retrieve it, the more accessible it will be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6070" target="_blank">01:41:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But sometimes it will be less immersive and more like a story that you've told a hundred times.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6075" target="_blank">01:41:15.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So is it – so it sounds like if we go on a vacation or to a show or something that taking a photo, as long as it's intentional, of something specific that will look – the key is to look at it later, not just post it, but to look at it later and to spend a few moments or more drawing to mind some of the emotional and cognitive experiences around that memory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6099" target="_blank">01:41:39.880</a></span> | <span class="t">That, however, changes the memory, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6103" target="_blank">01:41:43.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Anytime we create a story, we're changing the memory.</span></div><div

better than to not access the photo at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6112" target="_blank">01:41:52.880</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6118" target="_blank">01:41:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">A friend of mine who's a very successful photographer who shoots a lot of photos of musicians thinks this is the craziest thing, as if any one of those photos is going to be meaningful, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6128" target="_blank">01:42:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">That they're outside of the experience of the concert, which is exactly what you're describing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6133" target="_blank">01:42:13.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe you just have a memory of taking a lot of photos.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6135" target="_blank">01:42:15.880</a></span> | <span

what happens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6137" target="_blank">01:42:17.880</a></span> | <span class="t">People will remember something, but it's not their feeling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6141" target="_blank">01:42:21.880</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">01:42:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It's more like – I used this example in an interview, so apologies if people have already seen this, but it's like I got to see The

listening to them in high school, but I never got to see them because all the great bands I got into broke up right before Black Flag and The Minuteman and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6169" target="_blank">01:42:49.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So when they reunited, I was like – I had an opportunity to see them in a club in Sacramento.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6176" target="_blank">01:42:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So I saw them for the first time and what was – I wasn't one of the kids taking photos.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6182" target="_blank">01:43:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I was actually watching, but then there was a moment where Bill Stevenson, the drummer, who's a super intense guy and really one of the creative forces behind the band, he gets up and he starts walking towards the crowd.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6196" target="_blank">01:43:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And Milo's like, "Sit down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6197" target="_blank">01:43:17.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Go back behind the drums."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6198"

target="_blank">01:43:19.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to say something."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6200"

have this moment where he's now at this age able to appreciate this connection that he has with the audience that he couldn't appreciate before when he was younger.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6218" target="_blank">01:43:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was like, "I'm taking a picture of this because that's what I want to remember."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6223" target="_blank">01:43:43.880</a></span> | <span class="t">You won't remember everything, but if I look at that photo – technically, I haven't looked at that photo again – but just taking the picture of it forced me to really think about that.</span></div><div class="c"><span

really good job on, but what I really took away from that was this connection that I really wanted when I was a kid, you know?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6246" target="_blank">01:44:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And re-experiencing that feeling of being a kid and hearing these songs when they

an interaction with a loved one of various kinds, but when we go into these tunnels of attention, there's something that's so deeply satisfying about it, especially to those who have attention deficit

target="_blank">01:47:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So here's what I can say is that I think that we often think of – we think of like let's say an emotion, right?</span></div><div

like there is a basic response that you get when somebody points a gun at you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6468"

target="_blank">01:48:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">The question is does the potential catastrophe live within you or does it die within you?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

double-edged sword of neuroadrenergic systems is that they capture lots of memory and they open up thoughts about what could have gone wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6514" target="_blank">01:48:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is where I think it's like this – we talked about this before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6518" target="_blank">01:48:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">This appraisal is very important, you know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6521" target="_blank">01:48:41.880</a></span> | <span class="t">In the case of

class="t">But just to make this very concrete, the prefrontal cortex has top-down inputs to many of the neuromodulatory systems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6531" target="_blank">01:48:51.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So on average, people tend to think of the neuromodulatory systems like dopamine and norepinephrine as being very bottom-up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6538" target="_blank">01:48:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">They just send signals everywhere and set the brain into focus or not focus or whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6544" target="_blank">01:49:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But the prefrontal cortex has some – anatomically at least – some capability of regulating those systems both directly and indirectly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6554" target="_blank">01:49:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that does, I think, speak to this idea that if you have a very strong goal focus, you can in fact regulate the dopamine system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6563" target="_blank">01:49:23.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's a reasonable – and norepinephrine too, noradrenergic systems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6568" target="_blank">01:49:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think it's a reasonable

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6643" target="_blank">01:50:43.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So too much information, I know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6646" target="_blank">01:50:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But basically that is – yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6648" target="_blank">01:50:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So there is this issue with – in fact, actually, there's an article that Shirzai sent me in The Lancet that one of their public health recommendations is to get into a preventative mode for preventing Alzheimer's disease.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6663" target="_blank">01:51:03.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of the things they say is screen for hearing and give people hearing aids and make people use them if they – encourage people to use them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6670"

it, but it can really save so much money.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6683" target="_blank">01:51:23.880</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">01:51:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It's really amazing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6687" target="_blank">01:51:27.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Another one I mentioned briefly is oral hygiene.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6690" target="_blank">01:51:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Gum disease, it turns out, increases your risk for – I believe it's Alzheimer's and also for cognitive brain health in general.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6697" target="_blank">01:51:37.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I did an episode on oral health and the effects on, as you said, on brain health are amazing because streptococcus mutans, which is the bacteria that causes cavities, can funnel its way into the bloodstream and potentially cross the blood-brain barrier, which is, I think, why people think it might be detrimental to brain health.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6715" target="_blank">01:51:55.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6716" target="_blank">01:51:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean I don't know the detailed mechanisms, but I think that makes sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6719" target="_blank">01:51:59.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's this vague notion of cognitive reserve, which is basically some people seem to be quite immune to the effects of cognitive aging and some people seem to be very protected against Alzheimer's.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6731" target="_blank">01:52:11.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So what is it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6732" target="_blank">01:52:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the things that seems to come up as far as depleting cognitive reserve or putting it at high risk seems to be inflammation, right, neuroinflammation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6741" target="_blank">01:52:21.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so Kim McAllister, as you know, is doing work on this topic of neuroimmune interactions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6747" target="_blank">01:52:27.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And basically the immune system expresses itself in the brain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6750" target="_blank">01:52:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">You get microglia activation that can cause these inflammatory responses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6754" target="_blank">01:52:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's – reasonable evidence suggests that it's interacting with tau and amyloid and this kind of cascade of stuff that happens in Alzheimer's disease, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6764" target="_blank">01:52:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of the things that we're learning now and we don't know nearly enough, but the data out there is quite scary, in fact, is long COVID is associated with significant cognitive effects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6776" target="_blank">01:52:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And brain – is that the explanation for the brain fog that people report many, many months?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6781" target="_blank">01:53:01.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, it's – so they report a subjective brain fog and you can see this – you can measure this as a significant cognitive deficit that they're experiencing, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6789" target="_blank">01:53:09.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And we've seen in the past like HIV was – there was actually a whole variety of dementia that was associated with HIV from the viral transmission.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6799" target="_blank">01:53:19.880</a></span> | <span class="t">We can – like you can see with multiple sclerosis where you have like autoimmune responses in the brain affect mental function dramatically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6809" target="_blank">01:53:29.880</a></span> | <span class="t">We're seeing more and more evidence of this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6812" target="_blank">01:53:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this is, again, another one of those things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6814" target="_blank">01:53:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like people go, "Oh, COVID.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6816" target="_blank">01:53:36.880</a></span> | <span

mean, this is a health thing that can really affect people and it can – I don't think anybody – it's not a political issue to get brain fog.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6824" target="_blank">01:53:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It just sucks, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6825" target="_blank">01:53:45.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Nobody wants this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6826" target="_blank">01:53:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think that there's a lot we're learning about viruses and bacteria.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6832" target="_blank">01:53:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the cool things I was talking about before we started recording is I was at a conference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6838" target="_blank">01:53:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I met the coolest guy and I'm blanking on his name but I'll send it to you afterwards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6842" target="_blank">01:54:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But he's – he did this great study and he was studying the effects of nutrition on brain health and memory, especially cognition.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6850" target="_blank">01:54:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I said, "What's the most interesting finding that you've gotten?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6854" target="_blank">01:54:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I love to ask people this because I'm curious and it stimulates my curiosity and I usually get a good answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6859" target="_blank">01:54:19.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So he told me he did this study where he has these rats and he gives them sugary water during the day, about the equivalent, he said, to a can of Coke a day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6869" target="_blank">01:54:29.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So they're getting this sugar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6871" target="_blank">01:54:31.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So when they reach adulthood, you know, these teenage rats, they reach adulthood and they have memory problems and they do – they have hippocampal atrophy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6880" target="_blank">01:54:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So you go, "Okay, well, the hippocampus is affected, memory is affected, sugar, blah, blah, blah, no problem."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6886" target="_blank">01:54:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So then what he does is he takes the gut bacteria from the sugar animals and puts it in an animal that doesn't get this diet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6894" target="_blank">01:54:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And he finds the same kind of pathology and the same kind of memory deficit in these animals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6899" target="_blank">01:54:59.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's something about that process of like the gut-brain interaction that also seems to be playing a part in ways that I don't understand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6908" target="_blank">01:55:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I think they're still figuring it out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6910" target="_blank">01:55:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But again, this really shows this tight neuroimmune link, you know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6914" target="_blank">01:55:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">We're seeing this now with pollution.</span></div><div

there's nothing good about being in a place with a lot of smoke in the air, you know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6924"

this at UC Davis showing that you get – like she actually takes real pollution from the Caldecott Tunnel, which connects Oakland and –</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6945" target="_blank">01:55:45.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And finds that rats exposed to this pollution have hippocampal

of these environmental factors that can trigger the inflammatory response.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6957"

bad.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=6972" target="_blank">01:56:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">We've done some research on

to my mind, why these lifestyle factors like improved sleep, cardiovascular and resistance training exercise, but certainly cardiovascular exercise, you know, eating a lot of leafy foods, et

best ways to inflame your brain and body is to not get enough sleep and eat, you know, a lot of highly processed foods, for instance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

that are a little bit off the trajectory we're on now, but that come up a lot when people start thinking about memory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7201" target="_blank">02:00:01.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And one that's kind of intriguing, very intriguing, is deja vu.</span></div><div

is?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7210" target="_blank">02:00:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Is it just like a recollection of something similar that spontaneously gets triggered?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7216" target="_blank">02:00:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm like, what is deja vu?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7218" target="_blank">02:00:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, it's not fully understood, but I'll give you my best guess that's science-based and not just my wildly speculating completely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7226" target="_blank">02:00:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But basically, one of the early findings that gave you sense about what deja vu is is Hewlings Jackson, who's this great neurologist who did pioneering work in behavioral neurology, observed that many patients who get epilepsy would have this aura.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7243" target="_blank">02:00:43.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It's this mental sensations right before a seizure where they would get an intense feeling of deja vu.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7249" target="_blank">02:00:49.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It doesn't happen in everyone but a certain number.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7251" target="_blank">02:00:51.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is associated with temporal lobe epilepsy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7254" target="_blank">02:00:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And the hippocampus, as you know, is in the temporal lobe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7257" target="_blank">02:00:57.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's also these areas around it that are super important for memory, including the amygdala, but also really the peri-rhinal cortex is a key, key player in this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7268" target="_blank">02:01:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so then you have Wilder Penfield and other people who started to do these surgeries for epilepsy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7277" target="_blank">02:01:17.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And they said, well, I want to make sure I'm not taking out good brain, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7281" target="_blank">02:01:21.880</a></span> | <span class="t">You don't want to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7282" target="_blank">02:01:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So Penfield wasn't responsible for HM.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7284" target="_blank">02:01:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And that was like kind of an irresponsible surgery.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7286" target="_blank">02:01:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">HM is a now dead famous patient and literally chapter in the history of neuroscience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7294" target="_blank">02:01:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Somebody who had his hippocampi bilaterally, one on each side of the brain, removed to treat epilepsy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7302" target="_blank">02:01:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It fixed the epilepsy, but he had lost all capacity to remember prior events.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7311" target="_blank">02:01:51.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7312" target="_blank">02:01:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, in fact, he had this dense, dense amnesia, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7316" target="_blank">02:01:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And actually one of the little known things, even in memory research, is he actually lost – he had what's called a temporal lobectomy where they just hack off the front part of the temporal lobe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7327" target="_blank">02:02:07.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It might have been cauterized.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7329" target="_blank">02:02:09.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I can't remember the – I think he cauterized it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7332" target="_blank">02:02:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But anyway, they do that temporal lobectomy and he actually had the posterior one-third of his hippocampus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7338" target="_blank">02:02:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But he had lost his perirhinal cortex bilaterally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7342" target="_blank">02:02:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And that turned out to be – Betsy Murray at NIH later and other people turned out to be a huge thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7348" target="_blank">02:02:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So one of the reasons I think that he became so densely amnestic is that it was bilateral.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7354" target="_blank">02:02:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you think about the brain like you have a side of the brain that's causing a seizure, so you kind of got a spare tire on the other side where it's like that other healthy tissue on the other side can sometimes pick up the slack.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7365" target="_blank">02:02:45.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you take out both hemispheres now, you're in really bad shape.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7369" target="_blank">02:02:49.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So Scoville did that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7372" target="_blank">02:02:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">He actually did it for people who are – HM had epilepsy and it was a legit operation in that sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7377" target="_blank">02:02:57.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But he did it for people who had I think like psychosis to depression.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7380" target="_blank">02:03:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean back then they just did all kinds of crazy stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7383" target="_blank">02:03:03.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So – but Penfield was like, no, I want to make sure I take out only the tissue that needs to go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7389" target="_blank">02:03:09.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So what do you do?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7390" target="_blank">02:03:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">You stimulate different parts of the brain and you see does it produce anything other than a seizure?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7395" target="_blank">02:03:15.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And if so, that's not an area you want to remove.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7398" target="_blank">02:03:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so he would go into the anterior temporal lobes and stimulate and people would have – sometimes they would have an intense real memory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7405" target="_blank">02:03:25.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But sometimes they would have this intense sense of deja vu where it's like they feel this – I feel like I've lived out this whole thing that's happening right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7414" target="_blank">02:03:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I've lived

number of people – my lab was heavily involved with this and Andy Onalinis at UC Davis was really central to a lot of the stuff – found that the perirhinal cortex,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7431" target="_blank">02:03:51.880</a></span> | <span class="t">which is this area as I said, it's a big player with the hippocampus, seems to be very critical for this general sense of familiarity that we have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7440" target="_blank">02:04:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, I use in the book an example of like if I say, have you eaten a Rambutan before?</span></div><div class="c"><span

you were able to think about and go, I've never eaten a Rambutan?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7457"

and you're like, I know I've seen this person before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7499" target="_blank">02:04:59.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Where have I seen them before?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7501" target="_blank">02:05:01.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you leave and eventually you're like, oh, well, that was somebody who I met at this conference or something like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7506" target="_blank">02:05:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But you weren't expecting them at this context and no episodic memory is triggered.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7512" target="_blank">02:05:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But there was something about their features that felt very fluent and natural to you and triggered that sense of familiarity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7521" target="_blank">02:05:21.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And that seems to be processed and you can see brain activity associated with that in the perirhinal cortex.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7527" target="_blank">02:05:27.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And people with damage to the perirhinal cortex seem to not differentiate between the rambutan and the banana.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7534" target="_blank">02:05:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It's all kind of unfamiliar to them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7536" target="_blank">02:05:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">They might remember I've eaten a banana but they don't necessarily have that sense of familiarity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7541" target="_blank">02:05:41.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And Rebecca Burwell at Brown University did the coolest experiment that doesn't nearly get – you know how in science you get these unsung hero experiments?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7550" target="_blank">02:05:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, this was one of them where she stimulated in rats the perirhinal cortex at this frequency called the beta frequency,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7560" target="_blank">02:06:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">which is kind of a relatively low frequency oscillation, and basically put two objects in front of the animal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7569" target="_blank">02:06:09.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so like typically if there's a new object, the animal will spend more time like exploring it, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7576" target="_blank">02:06:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And depending on how she timed the stimulation, she could make the animal think that a familiar object was novel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7583" target="_blank">02:06:23.880</a></span> | <span class="t">She stimulates at a different frequency.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7585" target="_blank">02:06:25.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it was gamma.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7586" target="_blank">02:06:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And the animal now thinks of – or actually it was like – yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7591" target="_blank">02:06:31.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So she thinks – now the animal thinks that a familiar thing is novel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7594" target="_blank">02:06:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">With beta, it was that it thought a novel thing was familiar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7597" target="_blank">02:06:37.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Wow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7598" target="_blank">02:06:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So could literally use this stimulation to change the way the animal is interacting with and presumably a memory-driven way with this object, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7609" target="_blank">02:06:49.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So for those looking for novelty in different domains of life, maybe this is the solution.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7613" target="_blank">02:06:53.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7614" target="_blank">02:06:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so Anne Cleary, just to close the loop here, who's a great researcher at Colorado State, developed this beautiful paradigm where what she does is she said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7622" target="_blank">02:07:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">"Okay, well, does that relate to deja vu?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7624" target="_blank">02:07:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, let's see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7625" target="_blank">02:07:05.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So what she did was use virtual reality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7627" target="_blank">02:07:07.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so in virtual reality, you can create these environments and, you know, put objects in particular places.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7633" target="_blank">02:07:13.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so she creates these virtual environments where there are particular objects in particular places.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7639" target="_blank">02:07:19.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And let's say one's a museum, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7641" target="_blank">02:07:21.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So a person can go through passively and watch a movie or they actively navigate through these spaces.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7647" target="_blank">02:07:27.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And then what she does is she has them go through, let's say, a video arcade.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7650" target="_blank">02:07:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But unbeknownst to the subject, the objects that are in the room are in exactly the same positions as the objects in the museum.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7661" target="_blank">02:07:41.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's a video arcade, so it looks different.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7664" target="_blank">02:07:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But the room shape, the spatial layer, you know, everything is identical.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7668" target="_blank">02:07:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It's got a different skin on it, so to speak, for video gamers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7672" target="_blank">02:07:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So what happens is people are much more likely, very likely, to produce a deja vu sensation when they're in these places, these virtual environments,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7682" target="_blank">02:08:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">that look very much like where they've been, but they're mismatching in some critical way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7687" target="_blank">02:08:07.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's like you've got enough to trigger the strong sense of familiarity, but the mismatch is suppressing recollection.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7694" target="_blank">02:08:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that seems to be a crucial part of why you get this uncanny feeling of remembering is the strong familiarity you get.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7702" target="_blank">02:08:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And by the way, I've watched these movies, and I cannot for the life of me see that the museum is the same as the arcade.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7710" target="_blank">02:08:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It just feels so different cognitively.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7713" target="_blank">02:08:33.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, I can imagine being like, if I really did it immersively, having that sense of familiarity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7719" target="_blank">02:08:39.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So you're really pitting these things in opposition to each other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7722" target="_blank">02:08:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what likely happens with deja vu is something uncanny that triggers a little bit of memory retrieval or a strong fluency.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7732" target="_blank">02:08:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But then there's a mismatch that suppresses it and prevents a context from coming up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7739" target="_blank">02:08:59.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I'd like to talk about the relationship between memory and mental health for the following reason.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7746" target="_blank">02:09:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm very struck by the fact that in experiments such as the work that Carl Deisseroth, who was actually the first guest on this podcast, brilliant neuroengineer, of course, and psychiatrist, described in which he's talking to a patient who's depressed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7765" target="_blank">02:09:25.880</a></span> | <span class="t">This patient has a stimulator for the vagus nerve that can crank up stimulation of the vagus nerve.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7770" target="_blank">02:09:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And essentially, the narrative goes from this patient, I believe it was a woman in this case, talking about being suicidally depressed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7776" target="_blank">02:09:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">She can't anticipate doing anything of any interest or excitement to her, increasing vagal stimulation, which, by the way, folks, does not just calm people down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7784" target="_blank">02:09:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Vagal stimulation actually creates a lot of alertness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7787" target="_blank">02:09:47.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is a vast misconception out there that vagal stimulation is all about calming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7793" target="_blank">02:09:53.880</a></span> | <span class="t">In any case, as the vagal stimulation goes up, her narrative literally changes in real time to, yeah, I could see myself going out and applying for a job.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7802" target="_blank">02:10:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm kind of excited about the future, et cetera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7804" target="_blank">02:10:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So complete transformation of one's outlook, but also in some instances, memory of prior events.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7811" target="_blank">02:10:11.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So how we cast prior events is so interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7816" target="_blank">02:10:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And the bridge I'd like to build right now conceptually is that there are two papers that intrigued me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7823" target="_blank">02:10:23.880</a></span> | <span class="t">One is a paper from Lamberto Maffei's lab in Pisa, which had a paradigm for exploring learned helplessness in rodents, which is a sort of a model for depression.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7835" target="_blank">02:10:35.880</a></span> | <span class="t">How long a rodent is willing to swim in water to save its life before it gives up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7841" target="_blank">02:10:41.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's a learned helplessness that eventually arrives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7843" target="_blank">02:10:43.880</a></span> | <span class="t">These yes or not kind experiments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7844" target="_blank">02:10:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But at some point they give up and then they've essentially learned they're helpless.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7850" target="_blank">02:10:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And of course they save the animal before it dies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7853" target="_blank">02:10:53.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But these animals given essentially an SSRI like Prozac can restore some sense of hope, meaning they'll swim longer after having learned to be helpless.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7867" target="_blank">02:11:07.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7868" target="_blank">02:11:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Is it recovery of depression?</span></div><div

effective and they're not always effective.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7875" target="_blank">02:11:15.880</a></span> | <span

the same events.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7888" target="_blank">02:11:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, yep, a bunch of

to me, this is a shift in memory brought about by a dramatic shift in neuromodulators.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=7914"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8019" target="_blank">02:13:39.880</a></span> | <span class="t">What is that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8020" target="_blank">02:13:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, you know, serotonin is like a neuromodulator.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8022" target="_blank">02:13:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It enhances plasticity.</span></div><div

transient learning event, you will get a change in the connections between neurons that were active during that event.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8036" target="_blank">02:13:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And super interesting work right now going on in behavioral timescale plasticity and all this stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8041" target="_blank">02:14:01.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's not just cells that wire together, fire together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8043" target="_blank">02:14:03.880</a></span> | <span

wire together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8046" target="_blank">02:14:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It's more interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8047" target="_blank">02:14:07.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But those changes can often be transient.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8051" target="_blank">02:14:11.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And what people...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8052" target="_blank">02:14:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So, like, Eric Kandel, for instance, is one who studied serotonin in particular and emphasized this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8059" target="_blank">02:14:19.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But basically, many neuromodulators, if you give a little bath, bathe these neurons in serotonin or other neuromodulators, you stabilize that plasticity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8071" target="_blank">02:14:31.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And that allows, you know, increases in receptor density between these neurons that allow them to communicate more effectively.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8077" target="_blank">02:14:37.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, you can get weakening in LTD, too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8079" target="_blank">02:14:39.880</a></span> | <span class="t">We won't get into that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8080" target="_blank">02:14:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But serotonin definitely promotes plasticity, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8084" target="_blank">02:14:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so one of the things I talk about in my book is that memories are...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8090" target="_blank">02:14:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, we all have plasticity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8092" target="_blank">02:14:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">As I said, retrieving a memory can allow us to change the memory in certain ways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8096" target="_blank">02:14:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And it can change...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8097"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8102" target="_blank">02:15:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But the short version is you can change it.</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8126" target="_blank">02:15:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And it can also be part of the retrieved experience.</span></div><div

the way, Davis, I will just say, I'm biased, but it's one of the top three places in the world for learning and memory research.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

plasticity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8361" target="_blank">02:19:21.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, so he

report,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8375" target="_blank">02:19:35.880</a></span> | <span class="t">is that there's this period of integration afterwards where your brain's just like, you know, you could feel it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8381"

target="_blank">02:20:03.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8404" target="_blank">02:20:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just taking psychedelics is an experience, but certainly, but the learning of new contingencies occurs in the integration phase as well as within the session.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8414" target="_blank">02:20:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">That's why the clinical trials that showed some efficacy for some people were guided intensely by therapists.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8420"

target="_blank">02:20:21.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But the mere act of having plasticity, plasticity is an opportunity for learning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8425" target="_blank">02:20:25.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not the actual learning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8426" target="_blank">02:20:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">That's right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8427" target="_blank">02:20:27.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It opens up like significant opportunities for reshaping.</span></div><div

really interesting, is there's also a dissociative element of these drugs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8440" target="_blank">02:20:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So ketamine isn't a psychedelic, but I think there are some interesting plasticity effects and definitely produces this dissociative element too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8447" target="_blank">02:20:47.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But with psychedelics, there's often a major perspective shift.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8453" target="_blank">02:20:53.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And perspective is hugely important for memory because a lot of our sense of the emotional impact of our memory is based on a perspective that we adopt when we remember.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8465" target="_blank">02:21:05.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And research has shown that you can take the same encoding event,

just take a very simple thing, a very, you know, I give you a story and it's like I tell you now viewed from the perspective of someone else and you're trying to remember it.</span></div><div

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8571" target="_blank">02:22:51.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8574" target="_blank">02:22:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I do think that some of the concerns they had in the FDA I take issue with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8577" target="_blank">02:22:57.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But what I will say is that you have a drug that dramatically increases plasticity, but it changes dramatically the mental context that you have when you pull up the memory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8590" target="_blank">02:23:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So you have a real opportunity for memory updating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8594" target="_blank">02:23:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Now there's a phenomenon in the animal literature called reconsolidation where essentially the act of retrieving a memory opens it up to requiring some kinds of neuromodulators again to really promote resealing of the memory, so to speak.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8611" target="_blank">02:23:31.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But it can also, if you interrupt it, you can erase the memories.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8615" target="_blank">02:23:35.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And theoretically, if you can do that, you could also change the memories pretty significantly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8620" target="_blank">02:23:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So if I can vividly access some neural population that's giving me this, normally gives me this physiological response, it sets off this train of thoughts, and it's associated with this physical and mental context, and I can dramatically, I can access those neurons but dramatically reshape the context and dramatically reshape the narrative, I've created the opportunity for massive change.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8646" target="_blank">02:24:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And I don't know if that's true, but it sure makes sense to me that that's the case.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8651" target="_blank">02:24:11.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, having said that, if you and me share our traumatic elements of our childhood, I'm sure we can go out for drinks and do this for quite a few hours, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8661" target="_blank">02:24:21.880</a></span> | <span class="t">That in and of itself will also produce some change in our memories.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8665" target="_blank">02:24:25.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It's very powerful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8666" target="_blank">02:24:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And I saw this in the clinic where I was doing group therapy with Vietnam vets, and I'm like, I'm a total fraud.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8673" target="_blank">02:24:33.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm like, I don't know, 27 years old, 28 years old, and I'm like in with these like, you know, Vietnam vets in their 50s who've really seen stuff, you know, and they live in combat zones now in Chicago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8688" target="_blank">02:24:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And what I realized was everyone was telling their story, but they're hearing reflections of their story from me but also from other members of the group who they can relate to that are different from their narrative.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8704" target="_blank">02:25:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And now all of a sudden, what happens is the memory is no longer theirs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8710" target="_blank">02:25:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a collective memory that's shared by all these people, because the memory now incorporates elements of their reactions as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8719" target="_blank">02:25:19.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It allows people to remember it in a new context, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8724" target="_blank">02:25:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And we can just take a much more watered-down version of this where how many times have you had a terrible experience and it became a great story?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8733" target="_blank">02:25:33.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I basically say that there's no point in having a bad experience in life if you don't get a great story out of it, right?</span></div><div

experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8741" target="_blank">02:25:41.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I had paddle boarding and everything about this was stupid.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8746" target="_blank">02:25:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I

target="_blank">02:25:51.880</a></span> | <span class="t">No, I've made foolish errors in outdoor adventures in my past where afterwards I thought that was a really dumb move to even go to that location to dive, let alone what we did when we did there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8768" target="_blank">02:26:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, you know, I mean, some of the stupid stuff that we did.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8771" target="_blank">02:26:11.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And as kids, like bridge jumps and without testing water depth, I mean, stupid, stupid stuff that I don't recommend anyone repeat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8780" target="_blank">02:26:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But you're right, the surviving stories, you carry those forward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8785" target="_blank">02:26:25.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, yeah, exactly, exactly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8787" target="_blank">02:26:27.880</a></span> | <span class="t">The problem is the other stories we can talk about, people who are paralyzed, dead, etc., those stories exist too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8792" target="_blank">02:26:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8793" target="_blank">02:26:33.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And well, so, I mean, to be clear, it's like I felt horrible during that experience and it was one of the most immediately fear-inducing experiences I've had.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8801" target="_blank">02:26:41.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But later, me and Randy O'Reilly, the computational neuroscience, were friends.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8806" target="_blank">02:26:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">We both did this stupid thing together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8808" target="_blank">02:26:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">We would tell the story, tag team it, you know, we told it to students and friends and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8813" target="_blank">02:26:53.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And it just became funny.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8815" target="_blank">02:26:55.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so each time we told it, it just became kind of funnier and funnier and you start to embellish things and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8822" target="_blank">02:27:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that change of perspective was really drawn out by sharing and seeing people laugh and seeing people like, what were you thinking?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8830" target="_blank">02:27:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">You're such a smart person and you did this and it becomes part of the narrative.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8834" target="_blank">02:27:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, keep in mind, there are people who do this, that they say, like, I've had a really traumatic experience, but I've learned from it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8842" target="_blank">02:27:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I've had a horrible, emotionally abusive relationship, but I've learned from it, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8848" target="_blank">02:27:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And I don't mean to trivialize anybody's experience who didn't have that thing and they're just traumatized by it and they carry it with them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8855" target="_blank">02:27:35.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But what I am saying is, is that the memory, so to speak, I think in neuroscience right now, there's a big hot topic about engrams as if a bunch of neurons is the memory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8865" target="_blank">02:27:45.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But every time we have a memory, we're painting a new picture, we're creating a new novel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8872" target="_blank">02:27:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, and I think this is where people have to be very careful not to cowboy post-traumatic stress disorder treatment in a way that allows the narrative to make it worse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8885" target="_blank">02:28:05.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Because people, a previous guest on this podcast has this notion of, in describing this, of story fondling where people can go further and further into the description of how terrible something is reinforced by others.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8897" target="_blank">02:28:17.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the memory changes to become much worse than either the real events were or just simply worse within their body and mind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8905" target="_blank">02:28:25.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And then they have to live that forward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8906" target="_blank">02:28:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So it can go both ways, which is really points to the key, which is to do this with really trained professionals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8912" target="_blank">02:28:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8913" target="_blank">02:28:33.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8914" target="_blank">02:28:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's, it's all about like, cause you can re-traumatize yourself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8917" target="_blank">02:28:37.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is also why rumination is so bad in depression is because you recall a negative memory and that gets you in a negative mood because you pull up the context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8925" target="_blank">02:28:45.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And then that makes it easier to recall more negative memories.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8928" target="_blank">02:28:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And then every time you recall them, now they're getting more power because they're associated with these negative moods.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8933" target="_blank">02:28:53.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So recollection is really a double-edged blade.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8936" target="_blank">02:28:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8937"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8Pu9HBd48&t=8943" target="_blank">02:29:03.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So the original term nostalgia, I credit Felipe de Brigarde for it.</span></div><div
