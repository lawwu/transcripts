I'm being intentional. I've got to book the flights that maybe we haven't covered before. Make sure that the flights you've booked, you have added to your calendar to add it to an itinerary and that you're monitoring them, monitoring for things like seat changes, or sometimes there's a connection where maybe they'll have in your connecting flight, they'll change the flight times and now you have too short or too long of a connection or schedule change of any other sort, keep monitoring them.</p><p>And what you can do is sign up for alerts from the airline to make sure that they notify you for every change that happens to your flight, but also you can use monitoring tools that are out there, TripIt has some of them. Other tools have these automatic monitoring to make sure that you're getting the right flights and that changes don't occur in terms of how else to book, I would always keep an eye on optimizing your flights to see if maybe the price you've paid does drop with points and miles in particular.</p><p>You can usually get a rebate back of whatever the flight differences, huge chunk of miles back. So you do want to keep searching or keep monitoring automatically with tools to see if there's an advantage to take there.</p></div></div></body></html>
