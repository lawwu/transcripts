We actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&t=1566">00:26:06.540</a></span> | <span class="t">have signed two growth term sheets recently.

And,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&t=1597">00:26:37.740</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, companies only get remarked every couple of years.

So it is hard to know, like, what is the proper valuation of a company that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&t=1607">00:26:47.340</a></span> | <span class="t">raised money last year? Because yes, valuation multiples have come way down, but then also,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&t=1613">00:26:53.180</a></span> | <span class="t">they may have grown, and their performance is better.

So the point is, you, you basically calculate what was the multiple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&t=1678">00:27:58.700</a></span> | <span class="t">that you paid at, you know, entry in the company?

And what we see is, yeah, there's a lot of companies that we got into, I don't know, two</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&t=1689">00:28:09.660</a></span> | <span class="t">years ago at evaluation multiple that you couldn't defend today, 60 times 80 times 100 times. But the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&t=1696">00:28:16.860</a></span> | <span class="t">multiple today is more like 10 or 20 times, because it's actually grown really fast. So you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gS9UVSve0s&t=1701">00:28:21.740</a></span> | <span class="t">need to look at both sides of the equation.
