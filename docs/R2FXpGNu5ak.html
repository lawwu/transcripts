I look at those when I do my weekly plan. And in theory,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=48" target="_blank">00:00:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I have admin blocks during the week where I go and look at those task boards and pull out the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=52" target="_blank">00:00:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">appropriate task. And this is all good. You don't want these to exist just in your head. That's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=56" target="_blank">00:00:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">good place to keep them. However, there's a non-trivial fraction of my tasks that actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=62" target="_blank">00:01:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">do not exist on that task board, but instead on my calendar. I use Google Calendar. So typically,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=71" target="_blank">00:01:11.120</a></span> | <span class="t">they will exist for me on a given day as what's known as an all-day event. So it's a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=75" target="_blank">00:01:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">event that appears just at the top of the day, not at a particular time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=80" target="_blank">00:01:20.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So the question is, what type of tasks do I put on my calendar instead of my task board? Well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=86" target="_blank">00:01:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">to help answer this question, I have actually loaded my calendar in front of me. I did not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=90" target="_blank">00:01:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">prepare for this. I'm doing this on the fly. I have my calendar right here in front of me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to go back in the future and back in time a little bit. And let's just look at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">type of tasks I have on my calendar. All right, so like today, I had a scheduling task. There's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.520</a></span> | <span class="t">medical appointment I needed to schedule. I couldn't schedule it too far in advance,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and there was a note on my calendar for today to do that. And I did schedule that today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=118" target="_blank">00:01:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's see what else we have on here. Plan. Okay, so there was a change to our podcast recording</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=129" target="_blank">00:02:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">planning. So at some point, I knew the day that we were going to record, that Jesse and I were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">going to be in the studio wasn't going to work. And I put a note on my calendar to come up with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">an alternative plan and talk to Jesse about it. So that was something that was on my calendar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, I'm looking at real calendars here. Posting a problem set. This was last Wednesday. The new</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">problem set for the students in my class at Georgetown has to be posted. Check with our admin</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">about these graduate student TA job advertisements. So I had posted this information, or she was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">posting this information, and I had put a note on my calendar to follow up with her on given</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.360</a></span> | <span class="t">information. Let's find one more here. Send slides for a speaking client. Send them slides.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, so what do these examples have in common? In all of these cases, there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">their tasks, what I know when they need to be executed within a several day period.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Like send slides. That's the day either that they're due, or I know it's the next day I have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">time to actually get those slides together. Follow up with our admin about those TA job</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">posting announcements. Well, I knew when I sent all that information in that I should follow up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">in a week. So it was very time specific. Let's wait a week and then follow up on what's going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">That's why that existed on that particular day. Post the problem set. That actually had to happen</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">on that day. I post them on the specific days. It's listed on the syllabus when they're posted.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's a reminder that this is the day that problem set is going to be posted. I mentioned</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">before the schedule, the podcast, schedule the podcast, plan, change. You know, my vague memory</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">is that it came over the transom, the thing that was going to interrupt our schedule, but I was in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the middle of a bunch of things. But I knew it was really important. So I put it on my calendar,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.200</a></span> | <span class="t">like this is what I should do first thing Monday. And the final example I gave was scheduling this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">medical appointment. You could only schedule two weeks out. So I remember when I figured out,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">okay, I need to schedule this for the beginning of December. I went to my calendar to what's the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">day I'll be able to do that. Okay, let me put the note there. So in all of these cases, these examples</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I just took from my real calendar of tasks that exist just on my calendar, and not on my task</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">boards, they were all things that needed to happen within a relatively specific window.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Having them on the calendar, I think is a really reasonable way of doing it. Because for me,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">like a lot of knowledge workers, the one thing I know is going to be looked at all day long</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">is my calendar, because I have a lot of appointments and meetings and talks and whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I got to look at my calendar, or I'm just hosed. There's no there's no way I can not look at my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">calendar, I could go a day or two without looking at my task board, I'd be fine. If I go a day</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">without looking at my calendar, I'm going to miss five things. And so that's like not a bad place</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.240</a></span> | <span class="t">for it to be. Second, the second advantage of this is that it's well suited for weekly planning. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">when it comes time to do weekly planning for a week, you look at your task boards, you look at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">your calendar, but your task boards, you know, there's lots of things on there. But when you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">look at your calendar, the tasks that are living on your calendar for that week have now been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=316" target="_blank">00:05:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">highlighted, underlined flashing, these have to happen this week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">When you're thinking of your weekly plan, you then integrate those things into your weekly plan,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">now you probably would see it in your task board when you're going to your task board for preparing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">for your weekly plan. But there's a lot of things on your task board. And you know, you might miss</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">it that I had this thing really probably should happen this week. Or in some cases, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it could happen whenever but you've decided I really want to get this done before the end of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the month. So let me put a note on a particular week. There's a psychology here, where you feel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FXpGNu5ak&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">better about this thing, this will get taken care of, it's time sensitive.
