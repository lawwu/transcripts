I wish she did sometimes, right? If you have a recipe that you want from your mom or your aunt or your uncle, I think what you find more often than not, what I'm guilty of and I'm sure everyone else is, hey, text your mom, hey, can you tell me how you make that dish?</p><p>Can you give me like specifics? I think probably what would be more impactful and I don't wanna seem cheesy or hokey is like, get on a flight, spend a long weekend, and make it with them. That's what I think is missing in a lot of these things is like the recipe can actually prevent you from actually learning actually how to actually make it right.</p><p>For example, I've lived in Los Angeles for two years and I don't know the names of any of the fucking highways because all I do is follow GPS, right? But I understand that most people's cooking is like car GPS for them.</p></div></div></body></html>
