target="_blank">00:00:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">of cooked what they did is they have a new optimizer that gives us really really smooth loss curves with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=40" target="_blank">00:00:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">like no spikes throughout the entire training process this is kind of crazy um i won't go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=46" target="_blank">00:00:46.560</a></span> | <span class="t">super into detail on the optimizer since last week we we basically covered it so i think the recording</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=54" target="_blank">00:00:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">is already up on youtube uh if you're interested watch it but okay give me k2 who's uh who's used</span></div><div class="c"><span

know to just interrupt me whenever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=66" target="_blank">00:01:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and we can we can answer questions so basically this is like state of the art open source model it's very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=74" target="_blank">00:01:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">very big um i'm gonna check chat real quick okay nothing nothing about this so basically this is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=81" target="_blank">00:01:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">trillion parameters um it's not a thinking model but it's like deep seek v2 moment uh like the second deep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=88" target="_blank">00:01:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">seek moment um what they did is basically it's like better than claude on all coding benchmarks better</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">than like anything it's very very state of the art it's not thinking and it's a it's a very good uh</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=101" target="_blank">00:01:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">non-reasoning model it's very open source they shared um they shared this optimizer that's basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=108" target="_blank">00:01:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">like a better atom w and um this this week we just got out the actual tech report paper it's decent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.640</a></span> | <span class="t">honestly um it's like the first highlight of once again how do you train a very very large model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=124" target="_blank">00:02:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">so it's like kind of a pre-training post-training how do you train a large model and then the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=129" target="_blank">00:02:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">interesting note here for me was you get to see the problems of using china chips like they have the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">h-800s right because there was an export restriction so these chips are like different than um you know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">interconnected nodes and what do they do to come around that i think like two weeks ago we covered we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.560</a></span> | <span class="t">covered the other reasoning paper um magistral the reasoning paper from mistral and they show how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">they can just like skip some of these issues for full gpu efficiency um but yeah here's kimmy k2 so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">uh trillion parameter huge huge trillion parameter model with 32 billion active parameters very very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.360</a></span> | <span class="t">sparse uh they talk about the sparsity they talk about like experiments they did for sparseness ratios</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and all this stuff it's pre-trained on 15 trillion tokens they use a muon clip optimizer this is basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">like all the hot news they they put out a separate paper about this before um what this basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">leads to is very very good um training stability so uh they have this qk clip technique where they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">they're kind of clipping attention gradients and and yeah it's just very smooth smooth training okay so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">trained on 15 trillion tokens uh trillion total parameters 32 billion active parameters very sparse</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">um and then the big thing here is zero loss spikes which is kind of crazy um during post training there's multi-stage</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">process uh they they do a lot of synthetic data work another fun thing i would recommend about this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">people paper for people is they do good citations into other work so if you're interested in different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.560</a></span> | <span class="t">um like synthetic data generation pipelines they they cite quite a few cool papers there's a few in there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that are like good citations i'm gonna follow up and read uh estimates on the compute used in training</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">this yeah i think they actually say how much compute they used how much how much training compute uh how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">many gpus and stuff they had now it doesn't that doesn't account for a lot of the experiments they have a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">like ablations and stuff they have a lot of data generation i don't know if that necessarily ties</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">into how much they used for it right they share a decent amount of numbers but they don't share everything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">um yeah so large synthetic data synthesis pipeline and a joint oral stage honestly i found this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">model a little confusing because everyone calls it not a reasoning model and like sure it's not reasoning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">per se where it's like grpo like rollouts just like proper rl to think but they do have a lot of like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">rl to think so i don't know where the line blurs and i think this is a discussion we can have later and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">i'd love to hear people's thoughts but like i would semi call this a reasoning model like it it reasons</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and it's trying to reason with a like similar grpo with with some um with some changes but yeah it's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">state-of-the-art very very good coding model you can plug it into cloud code and stuff um</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">so we bench verified 65.8 it's like right up there with opus 03 all that stuff</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=319" target="_blank">00:05:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">um and it's very sparse you know it's it's sparse it should be cheap for people that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">host it for inference um on everything else it's pretty good it's very open source they give base</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">model and post train checkpoints um it's nice they do base model evals as well what's the difference</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">between a reasoning and a thinking model yeah that's a good question mostly we don't call stuff</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">thinking models we just have reasoning models and on reasoning models in this case i would consider</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=348" target="_blank">00:05:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">this thing to be like a reasoning model but yeah i guess there's just think tokens they just take out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=353" target="_blank">00:05:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">the think tokens and they just let it kind of reason um performance pretty good i think we can cover</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=361" target="_blank">00:06:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">charts later let's just get through the paper for now but if anyone's interested in diving on any of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">these we can we can kind of look at it um but yeah you know like coding benchmark basically up there with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=374" target="_blank">00:06:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">opus um the one that just beat this recently so like the the cool thing with this paper is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=379" target="_blank">00:06:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">it beats deep seek in like across the board on everything um as of a week later quen quen reasoning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=389" target="_blank">00:06:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">sorry quen coder beats this at coding which is cool so you know stuff is moving fast uh they basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=396" target="_blank">00:06:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">reran a bunch of benchmarks except for opus opus they just took their their numbers i think open hands</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">help them once we've been verified so shout out to them at the end but um opus was expensive to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=409" target="_blank">00:06:49.360</a></span> | <span class="t">benchmark it's it's crazy how expensive benchmarking is so but good for them to do it uh basically in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=415" target="_blank">00:06:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the introduction they go a little like um you know broader and they want to explain what are these terms</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=421" target="_blank">00:07:01.600</a></span> | <span class="t">so they have this um they have this like vision of agentic intelligence right uh models are no longer</span></div><div class="c"><span

to be agents so they need to like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=435" target="_blank">00:07:15.040</a></span> | <span

dynamically adapt to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=447" target="_blank">00:07:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">these um

might overfit and it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=1105" target="_blank">00:18:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">might just you're

sorry rephrasing it once and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=1143" target="_blank">00:19:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">training it for 10 epochs gets you quite a bit of improvement then there's rephrasing it 10 times and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=1149" target="_blank">00:19:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">doing one epoch you still get a little bit more improvement but you know the main difference like</span></div><div class="c"><span

reading this right when actually the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=1159" target="_blank">00:19:19.760</a></span> | <span

not data cleanup it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=1169" target="_blank">00:19:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">data augmentation so i think they keep both the original data and rephrase oh i see so they keep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=1176" target="_blank">00:19:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">both okay i was reading it wrong i thought the first one was raw 10 epochs the second one is only rephrased</span></div><div class="c"><span

it so what eugene is saying is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=1194" target="_blank">00:19:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you know in the the the benefit just comes from rephrasing what i read this as is keeping the original</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=1201" target="_blank">00:20:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and rephrasing it i think i'm right because if you look at the paragraph it says rephrasing the data once</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=1207" target="_blank">00:20:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">repeating it which i think as it as the rephrase data if you look at the third line which is uh so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=1214" target="_blank">00:20:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">that is actually cleaning up the data to be better</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

someone they did this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=1224" target="_blank">00:20:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">ablation so that's really nice yeah beautiful little um ablation basically rephrasing you get so much data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=1232"

adding in another look and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=1247" target="_blank">00:20:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">doing it

long context diagram basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=1265" target="_blank">00:21:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">you

target="_blank">00:21:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">this actually this diagram um i'm thinking a lot of time but uh in the third column let's say we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=1280" target="_blank">00:21:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">rephrase partial input one what does it mean to be auto regressive</span></div><div

target="_blank">00:21:55.440</a></span> | <span class="t">so so when i read the paragraph i read it as okay we've split in the paragraphs you rephrase it and we</span></div><div class="c"><span

target="_blank">00:22:14.240</a></span> | <span class="t">add the first paragraph and the second part at the new first paragraph and the raw second paragraph and</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=1350" target="_blank">00:22:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">is spent to small objects with preserved context rewritten sequentially then

target="_blank">00:22:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">doesn't have to be sequential right if it's there if you just do everything you can just be parallel the</span></div><div class="c"><span

feeding the the previous segment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=1376" target="_blank">00:22:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">into the rewrite step so so like the second rewrite model has like two inputs it has the like original</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

are rewriting the last</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHwZa7lZhK8&t=1391" target="_blank">00:23:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">chunk do we
