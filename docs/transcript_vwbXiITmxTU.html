How did you realize that? And how did you convince Microsoft to purchase GitHub? Well, so I had started a company called Xamarin together with Miguel de Caza and Joseph Hill, and we had built kind of mobile tools and platforms.</p><p>And Microsoft acquired the company in 2016. And I was excited about that. I thought it was great. But to be honest, I didn't actually expect or plan to spend, you know, more than a kind of a year or so there. But when I got in there, I got exposed to what Satya was doing and just the quality of his leadership team.</p><p>I was really impressed. And actually, I think I saw him in the first week or so I was there and he asked me, "What do you think we should do at Microsoft?" And I said, "I think we should buy GitHub." When would this have been? This was like my first week.</p><p>It was like March or April of 2016. Okay. And then he said, "Yeah, it's a good idea. We thought about it. I'm not sure we can get away with it," or something like that. And then it was about a year later, a little more than a year later, yeah, I wrote him an email, just a memo.</p><p>You know, I sort of said like, "I think it's time to do this." There was some noise that Google was sniffing around. I think that may have been manufactured by the GitHub team. But it was a good catalyst because it was something I thought made a lot of sense for Microsoft to do anyway.</p><p>And so I wrote an email to Satya, sort of a little memo saying, "Hey, I think we should buy GitHub. Here's why. Here's what we should do with it." And the basic argument was developers are making IT purchasing decisions now. It used to be this sort of IT thing, and now developers are leading that purchase.</p><p>And it's this sort of major shift in how software products are acquired. And Microsoft really was an IT company. It was not a developer company in the way most of its purchases were made, but it was founded as a developer company, right? And so Microsoft's first product was a programming language.</p><p>Yeah, I said, "Look, the challenge that we have is there's an entire new generation of developers who have no affinity with Microsoft. And the largest collection of them is at GitHub. And if we acquire this and we do a merely competent job of running it, we can earn the right to be considered by these developers for all the other products that we do." And to my surprise, Satya replied in like six or seven minutes and said, "I think this is very good thinking.</p><p>Let's meet next week or so and talk about it." And I ended up at this conference room with him and Amy Hood and Scott Guthrie and Kevin Scott and several other people. And they said, "Okay, tell us what you're thinking." And I kind of did a little 20-minute ramble on it.</p><p>And Satya said, "Yeah, I think we should do it. And why don't we run it independently like LinkedIn? Nat, you'll be the CEO." And he said, "Do you think we can get it for two billion?" And I said, "We could try." And three weeks later, he said, "Okay, go do this, Scott.</p><p>Scott will support you on this." Three weeks later, we had a signed term sheet and an announced deal. And then it was an amazing experience for me. I'd been there less than two years. And Microsoft was made up of and run by a lot of people who'd been there for many years.</p><p>And they trusted me with this really big project and made me feel really good to be trusted and empowered. And I had grown up in the open source world. And so for me to get an opportunity to run GitHub, it's like, I don't know, getting appointed mayor of your hometown or something like that.</p><p>It felt cool. And I really wanted to do a good job for developers. And so that's how it happened. That's actually one of the things I want to ask you about. Because often when something succeeds, we kind of think it was inevitable that it would succeed. But at the time, I remember, I mean, it was a while back, but I remember that there was a huge amount of skepticism.</p><p>I would go on Hacker News and the top thing would be a blog post about how Microsoft's going to mess up GitHub. And I guess those concerns have been alleviated throughout the years. But how did you deal with that skepticism and deal with that distrust? Well, I was really paranoid about it.</p><p>And I really cared about what developers thought. I think there's always this question of who are you performing for? Who do you actually really care about? Who's the audience that's in your head that you're trying to do a good job for, impress, earn the respect of, whatever it is.</p><p>And though I love Microsoft and care a lot about Satya and everyone there, I really cared about the developers. I'd grown up in this open source world. And so for me to do a bad job with this central institution and open source would have been a devastating feeling for me.</p><p>It was very important to me not to. So that was sort of the first thing is just that I cared. And then the second thing is that the deal leaked. It was going to be announced, I think, on a Monday. It leaked on a Friday. And Microsoft's buying GitHub.</p><p>And the whole weekend, there were terrible posts online, people saying, we've got to evacuate GitHub as quickly as possible. And we're like, oh my god, that's terrible. And then Monday, we put the announcement out. And we said, we're acquiring GitHub. It's going to run as an independent company. And then it said, Nat Friedman's going to be CEO.</p><p>And I had-- I don't want to overstate or whatever. But I think a couple people were like, oh, Nat comes from open source. He spent some time in open source. And it's going to be run independently. So I don't think they were really that calmed down. But at least a few people thought, oh, maybe I'll give this a few months and just see what happens before I migrate off.</p><p>And then my first day as CEO after we got the deal closed, 9 AM the first day, I was in this room. And we got on Zoom and all the heads of engineering and product. And I think maybe-- I don't know what people were expecting. But I think maybe they were expecting some kind of longer-term strategy or something.</p><p>But I came in. And I said, there was this GitHub had no official feedback mechanism that was publicly available. But there was several GitHub repos that community members had started. Isaac from NPM had started one where he'd just been allowing people to give GitHub feedback. And people had been voting on this stuff for years.</p><p>And I shared my screen and put that up, sorted by votes, and said, we're going to pick one thing from this list and fix it by the end of the day and ship that, just one thing. And I think people were like, this is the new CEO strategy. And they were like, I don't know.</p><p>You have to do database migrations. You can't do that in a day. And then someone's like, well, maybe we can do this. We actually have a half implementation of this. And we eventually found something that we could fix by the end of the day. And what I'm thinking is-- what I'm thinking, what I hope I said was, what we need to show the world is that GitHub cares about developers, not that it cares about Microsoft.</p><p>If the first thing we did after the acquisition was to add Skype integration, developers would have said, oh, we're not your priority. You have new priorities now. And so the idea was just to find ways to make it better for the people who use it and have them see that we cared about that immediately.</p><p>And so I said, we're going to do this today. And then we're going to do it every day for the next 100 days. And it was cool, because I think it created some really good feedback loops, at least for me. One was, you ship things. And then people are like, oh, hey, I've been wanting to see this fixed for years.</p><p>And now it's fixed. It's a relatively simple thing. So you get this sort of nice dopaminergic feedback loop going there. And then people in the team feel the excitement of shipping stuff. I think GitHub was a company that had a little bit of stage fright about shipping previously. And so to break that static friction and ship a little bit more, I think felt good.</p><p>And then the other one is just the learning loop. By trying to do lots of small things, I got exposed to like, OK, this team is really good. Or this part of the code has a lot of tech debt. Or hey, we shipped that, and it was actually kind of bad.</p><p>How come that design got out? Whereas if the project had been some six-month thing, I'm not sure my learning would have been quite as quick about the company. And there's still things I missed and mistakes I made, for sure. But that was part of how I think-- no one knows counterfactually whether that made a big difference or not.</p><p>But I do think that earned some trust.</p></div></div></body></html>
