They just really simplify his decision-making about things because he just took the uncertainty out of it. So he says, "If someone is raising money for charity, I always give money. If I fly for more than five hours or whatever the number is, I always fly business class." And it just makes it super simple because he's thought about the decision abstractly from actually having to make it.</p><p>He's like, "I always buy books. If I want to learn something and a book might have the answer, I always buy it. I never stress out if it's $10 or $12 or $20. I just always buy it." Talk about this Bill of Rights because it seems like something that I and maybe everyone listening would benefit from having.</p><p>Yes. And we all have one. It might be a very short list of rights or it might be a long list of rights. The more socially not free you are, the more you're in the cage, the shorter your Bill of Rights. A Bill of Rights is just a statement of permissions.</p><p>I'm allowed to. I have a right to. And you'll know what's in your Bill of Rights based on how you feel and what you do. So do I have a right to say no to that person requesting I come to their thing? Well, did you say yes when you didn't want to go?</p><p>Then you might not have a right that says I get to say no to people's requests, people's invitations. And this gets... You might say, I have a right to repeatedly say no to someone's requests. That's a different thing. And here's some core ones that I encourage people to adopt and make sure they have on their Bill of Rights.</p><p>I have a right to ask for what I want. I have a right to say no. I have a right to approach anyone, whether that's virtually or in person. Doesn't mean they want to talk to you, but if you stop yourself before you even allow the opening or the approach, you're going to limit your life significantly.</p><p>And people have all kinds of stories. Oh, I'm going to bother them. Oh, hey, I don't know. Maybe they'll be bothered. Maybe they won't. Let's find out. You know, in the case of the person wanting to hire you for your services, right? I have a right to ask for whatever fee I want for my services, whatever feels right.</p><p>And so the longer... Actually, it's an exercise. It's very much worth doing. And I do it with clients. It's like having to sit down and like, well, write it out. It doesn't have to be perfect. What would feel empowering to you? What as you write it, you're kind of nodding your head being like, yeah, all right.</p><p>And then just come up with a list of five, 10. And this is your... Like a nation that has a Bill of Rights for its people, this is your Bill of Rights for you. And those must first be written and then they have to be practiced. Otherwise, they're just flowery language on paper if you're not actually doing them.</p><p>Are there a few more examples you can give to inspire people as they're hopefully thinking about what would be on theirs? Yeah. I mean, I think one thing to break it down is just think of the different areas of your life, right? So you think about in your relationship, your romantic relationship, right?</p><p>I have a right to tell my partner when something's bothering me. And now it might sound real simple, but a lot of people shy away. I don't want to upset them. I don't want to bother them. You know, I have a right to... Oh, here's a... This one I had to add to my Bill of Rights.</p><p>It's a doozy. I have a right to disappoint people. Particularly, I have a right to disappoint my partner. Talk about that. Yeah. Well, that one was like, you know, I would be running around in my whole life trying not to disappoint anybody. I don't want to have anyone be let down.</p><p>And look, you know, it's great to be connected with your spouse and not just constantly not give a crap and disappoint them all over the place. Sure. But no matter how loving you're trying to be, how generous you're trying to be, if you're being authentic and true to what you really want, sometimes you're going to disappoint them.</p><p>They want you to go to that thing and you don't want to go. They want to have time to connect with you but you are unavailable for whatever reason. And so being able to say no and then withstand that discomfort of someone is disappointed in me. And the reason I created that Bill of Rights for myself is because I lived with this kind of chronic background anxiety that someone somewhere was going to be disappointed with me.</p><p>And so just to be like, yeah, I have a right to sometimes people disappointed with me and I have a right to do that sometimes and really resting on that. That's what it feels like. It feels like you can rest on your Bill of Rights and like all as well.</p><p>Like I'm allowed to do that. And it's almost like, like, you know, teaching a child, like, hey, you're allowed to do this, but we kind of have to do that for our own, our own selves now. So you can look at that relationship life, look at inside of your career and your work.</p><p>What do you, you know, unique to your thing? I have a right to ask a question in a meeting. I have a right to disagree with somebody. That's a big one. And you can think about it socially too, right? Like I, this is a great one. I have a right to change the subject of a conversation.</p><p>I guess nice people can get trapped on the rails, right? Oh, we're talking about their thing. I don't want to talk. How do I get out of this? And then they pause for a minute. And because you don't have a right to change the subject, instead of changing the subject, you say, Hmm, tell me more.</p><p>And then the conversation keeps going and you're trapped, right? I lived in that one for a long time. So I have a right to change the subject. Ooh, here's a good one. I have a right to interrupt people, right? Cause sometimes you're talking to someone and they're going on and on and on.</p><p>And you guys say, Hey, I want to ask you something. That's a great technique for interrupting by the way, as if it just came to you, Hey, right in the middle of their sentence, blah, blah, blah. Hey, I just thought of something. I wanted to ask you something and then boom, you can steer it a new direction.</p></div></div></body></html>
