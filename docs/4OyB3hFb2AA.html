play to the public, but I did, I played him at the mothership, um, only cause nobody has their phones in there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5379" target="_blank">01:29:39.580</a></span> | <span class="t">But, uh, when I, after, right after we did Rogan, I had, I got a chance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5383" target="_blank">01:29:43.940</a></span> | <span class="t">I got, somehow I got connected

target="_blank">01:29:49.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And I love Adam again, you know, he, he was on the thing with Norm MacDonald is how I got introduced to him, that show Norm MacDonald had, but he's just, he's an awesome dude.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5398" target="_blank">01:29:58.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we, we ended up at the mothership, uh, I think it was the evening after the Rogan podcast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5403" target="_blank">01:30:03.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And, um, Tom's like, well, they've never had, they've never had live music in here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5408" target="_blank">01:30:08.980</a></span> | <span class="t">He's like, you could be the first one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5410" target="_blank">01:30:10.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was like, whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5411" target="_blank">01:30:11.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, uh, we only had one guitar and I had my guitarist, Joey with me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5417" target="_blank">01:30:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So Ron White was there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5419" target="_blank">01:30:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It was Tom Segura and then Ron White that night.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5421" target="_blank">01:30:21.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And Ron took Joey in his car, drove him across town to his, uh, to his house and grabbed another guitar and came back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5430" target="_blank">01:30:30.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And we got up there and we did like two really silly songs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5433" target="_blank">01:30:33.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And then Richmond in between, um, in between Tom's set and Ron's set.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5438" target="_blank">01:30:38.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was like, again, that was one of those moments in my life where I was like, what, like, what, what is this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5445" target="_blank">01:30:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, what is this crazy reality I'm in?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5446" target="_blank">01:30:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">But I do have some funny, I used to, cause a lot of, when I wasn't playing the open mics, you know, the, well, like, you know, Brian that you met.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5454" target="_blank">01:30:54.180</a></span> | <span class="t">A lot of my guitar playing was spent at places like his house and we were all heavy drinkers and we were just sitting around at a party plan or whatever, you know?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5461" target="_blank">01:31:01.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I definitely liked the silly stuff too, but I was really in my head when we were talking about being low and what I would suggest people to do if they're in that point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5469" target="_blank">01:31:09.220</a></span> | <span class="t">But if I was just to like, not to flip this, but just, it just popped in my head, but probably what I would tell anybody to do if they're like suicidal and thinking about like, if they're to that point is just to go find some, go find somewhere outside, like in nature and go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5483" target="_blank">01:31:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Like that's what, you know, that's, I kind of missed this step when we were talking about things, but like selling my house and buying that property and putting a camper on it and trying to go into this whole off-grid thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=5494" target="_blank">01:31:34.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Really like, I don't

thing does something to my mind that I hate, which really is the opposite</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6028" target="_blank">01:40:28.920</a></span> | <span class="t">of nature, like the feeling I remember being out in nature and not just a hike hike is good,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6035" target="_blank">01:40:35.300</a></span> | <span class="t">but like for prolonged periods of time, several days away from the internet, away from all that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6040" target="_blank">01:40:40.300</a></span> | <span class="t">What is that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6041" target="_blank">01:40:41.380</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know what that is, but I don't like what X Twitter are doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6046" target="_blank">01:40:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't like what Instagram is doing, whatever that is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6049" target="_blank">01:40:49.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think that's good for the soul.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6051" target="_blank">01:40:51.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, it's emulating things that we need to be healthy humans, but it's just like feeding it visually and audibly to us, but it's not giving us the, it's giving us the instant gratification of it, but it's not giving us the long-term pleasure or fulfillment of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6068" target="_blank">01:41:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Like I said, like, and the beauty is we're in this weird period in time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6073" target="_blank">01:41:13.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Like it's a breath of time that we're in where, where we are able to conceptualize and observe what life was like in that transition point that's got us up till now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6085" target="_blank">01:41:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And we also have the, because in order for all this to, to continue to evolve, like, like even with AI, like it needs us more than we need it right now still for a very short period of time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6096" target="_blank">01:41:36.500</a></span> | <span class="t">But we have access to nearly all the information that the world has theoretically, but we also still have the perception and the, the memory of what life was like before it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6107" target="_blank">01:41:47.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this is like a very short window of time, like a breath of time where I think we can find a way to like incorporate this into normal life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6118" target="_blank">01:41:58.260</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think like, if that breath leaves us, like, I don't know, I think it's irrever, you know, I believe that I truly believe it is irreversible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6124" target="_blank">01:42:04.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think like, and that's just going to be the end of us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6127" target="_blank">01:42:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And it, and it could take two or three more generations to get to that point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6130" target="_blank">01:42:10.900</a></span> | <span class="t">But like, I, I think like, why don't we find people that are way smarter than me and, and look at all the things that trend on social media, like the videos that everybody watches, like, I don't know what it is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6143" target="_blank">01:42:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">If it's wood splitting and plumbing and blacksmithing and doing something with like, let's find all the things that people are attracted to online that they obviously are like interested in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6153" target="_blank">01:42:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And, and just figure out a way to have them in real life for people to immerse themselves in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6158" target="_blank">01:42:38.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6158" target="_blank">01:42:38.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, it's the transitionary state.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6159" target="_blank">01:42:39.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And I, one of the responsibilities I take very seriously, because I agree with you, is I tried to pierce the bubble that is San Francisco, that is the Silicon Valley, that is the people that build these technologies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6171" target="_blank">01:42:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">They, they often live a bit in a bubble.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6173" target="_blank">01:42:53.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6174" target="_blank">01:42:54.120</a></span> | <span class="t">That said, the people that criticize tech folks also live in a bubble.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6178" target="_blank">01:42:58.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6179" target="_blank">01:42:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And to sort of, first of all, piercing bubbles in general is, is good for people to get along, to understand each other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6184" target="_blank">01:43:04.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Because people that say all technology is evil, unfortunately technology, even if that's true, which I don't think it is, you, it's coming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6195" target="_blank">01:43:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">It's going to be built.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6198" target="_blank">01:43:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you have to figure out how to do it in a way that preserves our humanity, that, that doesn't drag us into this black hole of like, just maximizing engagement, maximizing this dopamine thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6210" target="_blank">01:43:30.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Where, where, instead of reading Dostoevsky, which I should be doing, I'm looking at some girl doing, shaking her ass on Instagram, and then feeling horrible about myself five minutes later.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6219" target="_blank">01:43:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6219" target="_blank">01:43:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, that, at scale, is what seems to be happening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6223" target="_blank">01:43:43.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, like, reminding ourselves that this is not the way to steer human civilization to progress, to flourishing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6230" target="_blank">01:43:50.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, the problem is, is I think we're wasting a lot of our, our bandwidth, like a lot of the, like, we only have so many minutes in a day to even use our brains.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6239" target="_blank">01:43:59.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And our brains can only do, but so much in a day anyway.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6242" target="_blank">01:44:02.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And when we're wasting any of it on just that, it's like the, it's like, I, I see it in my own professional opinion as the world is becoming just a little more in the last decade or two, as the world becomes a little more dreary and dark.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6259" target="_blank">01:44:19.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And more problems happen and city streets become more littered and jobs are like all these kinds of problems that we, that we all argue about all the time as they become more prevalent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6269" target="_blank">01:44:29.300</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like the internet and, and just the visuals of the internet become so much more immersive and video games are so much more, everything's so much better here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6277" target="_blank">01:44:37.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Everything's improving at lightning speed and technology and it's degrading in society and in the real world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6284" target="_blank">01:44:44.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And somehow there's gotta, there's gotta be a way to find a balance there, but right now it seems like as technology becomes more immersive and addictive and, and interactive, you know, like the way these algorithms like feed us exactly what we want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6295" target="_blank">01:44:55.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's so much psychology and just so much research that goes into making them as addictive as possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6300" target="_blank">01:45:00.680</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like the real world kind of sucks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6302" target="_blank">01:45:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, you know, cities that were beautiful and thriving are now falling apart, like, and, and, and have all kinds of problems that are being unaddressed and lack of leader.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6311" target="_blank">01:45:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like, there's gotta be some kind of weight, but it's, and so it's easy for us to feel more and more inclined to escape into the digital realm because the digital realm is becoming more fun while real life is becoming less fun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6323" target="_blank">01:45:23.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's gotta be some kind of way to balance between the two.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6326" target="_blank">01:45:26.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm with you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6326" target="_blank">01:45:26.580</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not against technology at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6328" target="_blank">01:45:28.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I think, um, evil most certainly existed long before there were computers, like, and, and in even more treacherous ways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6334" target="_blank">01:45:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Like now we have the ability to do, we're, like I said, we're in a very, we're in a very temporary state right now in 2025 where we have access, where the general public has access to basically all the information there is and artificial intelligence and just immense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6350" target="_blank">01:45:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And the ability that like a guy can just set a bunch of cameras up and start doing podcasts and have just the, like, even just the fact that this, that your platform could be created is like immensely powerful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6360" target="_blank">01:46:00.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It never, probably never existed in world history up until now, but we also still have, the problem is, is if we just keep going without being careful about, about losing the real world aspect of it, is that like, at some point we're just going to get so lost and so immersed in this space.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6376" target="_blank">01:46:16.600</a></span> | <span class="t">We're not even going to know what we're, we're not even going to know what we're missing out on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6379" target="_blank">01:46:19.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, all there's going to be is girls on Instagram.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6382" target="_blank">01:46:22.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Like all there's going to be is that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6383" target="_blank">01:46:23.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6384" target="_blank">01:46:24.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I've been trying to figure it all out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6385" target="_blank">01:46:25.700</a></span> | <span class="t">I just did a super long podcast with, uh, Tim Sweeney, the CEO of Epic Games, who created Fortnite and created Unreal Engine, a lot of interesting video games, like revolutionary video games.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6397" target="_blank">01:46:37.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So I don't know if you know, but Fortnite is this gigantic video game where people go into, uh, into an online world and they shoot stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6406" target="_blank">01:46:46.680</a></span> | <span class="t">It's fun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6407" target="_blank">01:46:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">It's, it's not like Call of Duty, intense, militaristic, like raw, real kind of shooting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6413" target="_blank">01:46:53.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It's more fun shooting at each other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6415" target="_blank">01:46:55.140</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, at first I was skeptical, like, is that a good way to have, to hang out with friends?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6421" target="_blank">01:47:01.100</a></span> | <span class="t">But then I got to do it with people that I'm actually friends with in physical reality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6427" target="_blank">01:47:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6427" target="_blank">01:47:07.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And you get to hear each other's voice and you just talk and talk shit about each other together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6433" target="_blank">01:47:13.820</a></span> | <span class="t">It's basically a phone call, honestly, with some visuals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6438" target="_blank">01:47:18.580</a></span> | <span class="t">You're not, it's not about the visuals, it's about the phone call and it just makes it a little more convenient to connect regularly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6444" target="_blank">01:47:24.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6444" target="_blank">01:47:24.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think you do need to remember that all of that only works if you're consistently returning to physical reality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6452" target="_blank">01:47:32.700</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, um, in this case, like taking the quote unquote, uh, guy trip, not the Brokeback Mountain style, but just friends, you know, just friends, a trip out in nature together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6465" target="_blank">01:47:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, like dudes on a hunting trip or, or just fishing or just hanging out in physical reality together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6471" target="_blank">01:47:51.140</a></span> | <span class="t">It's really a fun, like we should not forget the importance of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6474" target="_blank">01:47:54.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You talked earlier about loneliness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6476" target="_blank">01:47:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that got brought up at some point, but I do think that's like a big, that's a problem that's caused a lot of our symptoms is that we are all like very lonely, even though we are all, we all seem to be so well connected digitally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6488" target="_blank">01:48:08.200</a></span> | <span class="t">We are all so lonely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6489" target="_blank">01:48:09.660</a></span> | <span class="t">You got to think, I mean, modern warfare too, was a big thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6492" target="_blank">01:48:12.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I was, I was supposed to be in class of 2010.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6495" target="_blank">01:48:15.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can think like when I was in whatever grade, eighth grade or whatever, call of duty was like the thing, you know, I, I've certainly like, trust me, I'm not saying that I, I'm right in this space of digital immersion with anybody else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6508" target="_blank">01:48:28.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Like I've, I've, I've been there and seen it and done, you know, like, but I, I've wasted who knows how many hundreds of hours on modern warfare too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6515" target="_blank">01:48:35.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And like, I really built some great friendships from it, you know, I, like I, there's, there's a place for all that stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6523" target="_blank">01:48:43.480</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just like, we ha like, there is just this, we have this innate responsibility to like, to, again, it just goes back to this, goes back to talking about our founding fathers and the way this country was created and the importance and the, like the importance of, of what it did for the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6542" target="_blank">01:49:02.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, you know, and my, my understanding is that it was the first, it was the first time ever that people got together and agreed that, like you said, every man was equal because they were created in the image of God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6552" target="_blank">01:49:12.580</a></span> | <span class="t">They had unalienable rights that no government could take away from them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6555" target="_blank">01:49:15.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's really important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6556" target="_blank">01:49:16.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Like we, there won't be fortnight if we don't worry about that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6560" target="_blank">01:49:20.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And, and honestly, like just the collapsing in our structure with the mental health, with our youth and the suicide rates with our blue collar workers and all these kinds of things we've touched and talked about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6569" target="_blank">01:49:29.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Like the, those are all just things we just need more time together in real life to fix those problems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6574" target="_blank">01:49:34.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Those are just things, like I said, I make the joke, but like, like there's never been one argument that I've, there's never been one dispute with my wife that I've been able to figure out how to fix through a text message.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6585" target="_blank">01:49:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Or like, like it takes, it takes being in person with people and, and like having human connection to fix any problem and heal anything, you know?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6594" target="_blank">01:49:54.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it's difficult.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6595" target="_blank">01:49:55.220</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like, I don't, it's not anybody's fault that we're like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6597" target="_blank">01:49:57.700</a></span> | <span class="t">We're not even able to really get to know each other and understand each other through the internet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6601" target="_blank">01:50:01.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Like we almost have to be together in person to even just get each other's point of view and perspectives on things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6607" target="_blank">01:50:07.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And you know, yeah, fuck the division that the internet creates, honestly, like the left and the right is, it's been, it's been, it's been kind of a nightmare for me just to watch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6617" target="_blank">01:50:17.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Cause I see the very simple reality that we're in it together and that there's a lot more commonality between people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6622" target="_blank">01:50:22.680</a></span> | <span class="t">It seems cliche to say, but it's like now that needs to be said more than ever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6629" target="_blank">01:50:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Cause it, when you look on X, it feels like everybody's divided, but we're not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6634" target="_blank">01:50:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, and people are always going to think differently too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6636" target="_blank">01:50:36.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Like just in our structure and the way we, you know, again, it's like that, it goes back to that Jordan Peterson lecture about, I think in maps of meaning where he talks about people who think more conservatively or more liberally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6647" target="_blank">01:50:47.220</a></span> | <span class="t">About things like it's been applied to politics, but it is more, it's based more in psychology than anything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6653" target="_blank">01:50:53.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Like some people are going to have, some people are going to think more inside the box and some people are going to think more outside the box, but we have to have both in order to have a healthy society.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6662" target="_blank">01:51:02.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, oh, and also the thing that bothers me, your song, Richmond, North of Richmond, a lot of people, so pretty even split people on the left and the right in terms of friends of mine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6676" target="_blank">01:51:16.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Sadly, they've drifted towards the extremes a bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6680" target="_blank">01:51:20.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Those on the left definitely have developed a case of Trump derangement syndrome.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6686" target="_blank">01:51:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Those on the right seem to think that every person on the left is a kind of radical leftist.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6692" target="_blank">01:51:32.900</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like hilarious to listen to people talk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6697" target="_blank">01:51:37.300</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like everybody's lost their mind, it feels like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6700" target="_blank">01:51:40.900</a></span> | <span class="t">But also, on top of that, people on the right see Trump as a savior, as this figure who is, who could do no wrong, who's going to restore freedom in America and all, you know, continue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6716" target="_blank">01:51:56.280</a></span> | <span class="t">You can do a full list of really positive things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6718" target="_blank">01:51:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And to me, he's yet another rich man, North of Richmond.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6722" target="_blank">01:52:02.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Biden, Trump, it's all the same thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6725" target="_blank">01:52:05.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, some might be able to do more good than others, but ultimately, they're in positions of power and power corrupts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6732" target="_blank">01:52:12.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And those in those positions often forget about the everyday person, the working class, and they leave them behind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6742" target="_blank">01:52:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Ultimately, serve the people that are close to them and sometimes serve themselves to maintain power, to grow their power.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6750" target="_blank">01:52:30.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the good thing you can say about them is they, and I can say that about both Donald Trump and Joe Biden, is that they really love their family.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6761" target="_blank">01:52:41.340</a></span> | <span class="t">I can say that one of the things that I love about both people is that they genuinely love their family.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6770" target="_blank">01:52:50.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And like, it was always heartwarming to me to see how much Joe Biden loves his family.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6776" target="_blank">01:52:56.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, and honestly, like, just do anything for his family.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6780" target="_blank">01:53:00.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And the same is true for Trump.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6782" target="_blank">01:53:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that just reminds you that they're human beings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6784" target="_blank">01:53:04.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And yeah, all that to say is like, we need to see the humanity in each of us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6789" target="_blank">01:53:09.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And to some degree, always distrust the people in power.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6794" target="_blank">01:53:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">The power that people have only exists because we allow it, whether willingly or just through our own negligence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6800" target="_blank">01:53:20.780</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think that's the important thing is like, like I said, there's always more of us than there will be of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6806" target="_blank">01:53:26.840</a></span> | <span class="t">There's always more, there's always more nobodies than there ever will be people at the top.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6810" target="_blank">01:53:30.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And we just have to figure out what to do with that and how to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6812" target="_blank">01:53:32.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think this is, like I said, a short window of time to where we can still figure that out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6819" target="_blank">01:53:39.460</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I got to ask you about something before I forget.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6823" target="_blank">01:53:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I think I saw on Instagram, you talked about a three-legged cat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6826" target="_blank">01:53:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Is that a real thing?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6827" target="_blank">01:53:47.500</a></span> | <span class="t">What's the story behind the three-legged cat?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6829" target="_blank">01:53:49.360</a></span> | <span class="t">The reason I want to ask you that, first of all, I want to hear this story.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6832" target="_blank">01:53:52.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And second of all, I want to read to you one of my favorite Bukowski poems afterwards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6837" target="_blank">01:53:57.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Nice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6837" target="_blank">01:53:57.660</a></span> | <span class="t">About another cat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6839" target="_blank">01:53:59.820</a></span> | <span class="t">I had this cat lady neighbor who's a real sweet lady, but, um, older lady lives in a single wide trailer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6849" target="_blank">01:54:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Has probably got,

Saturday morning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6858" target="_blank">01:54:18.020</a></span> | <span class="t">It was pouring down

like eight o'clock in the morning on Saturday.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6861" target="_blank">01:54:21.140</a></span> | <span

hear this lady yelling, there's this cat stuck in my car.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6867"

any of us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6874" target="_blank">01:54:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But we go over there and the lady's tried to start her car.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=6877" target="_blank">01:54:37.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And

up and I was playing that little Gretsch resonator that's in all the original videos.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7559" target="_blank">02:05:59.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And my, my wife had got me that off of Amazon, I think, or something for like three or 400 bucks.</span></div><div class="c"><span

target="_blank">02:06:15.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So here we are, everything happens all at once and we're trying to do these shows and like, you know, I think the biggest one I did.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7582" target="_blank">02:06:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So basically what I ended up having to do was go, I bought one of these suction cup rigs that sticks right here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7588" target="_blank">02:06:28.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And the mic goes down under here to pick that string up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7591" target="_blank">02:06:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And I played like, we played like a, I think the biggest show I did with it was like 10,000 people, but it was enough to where I couldn't be doing a $300 guitar with a, with a rigged up thing on it anymore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7603" target="_blank">02:06:43.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So this guy reached out and, um, Gretsch wouldn't help me with my Gret.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7608" target="_blank">02:06:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, you know, there's no way to really get ahold of them because they're such a big company.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7612" target="_blank">02:06:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I, I finally did get ahold of Diane Gretsch and she's like really nice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7615" target="_blank">02:06:55.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it's nothing personal against Gretsch.</span></div><div class="c"><span

everywhere sold out of those, that Gretsch model when the song blew up, you know, like it was a real pop, but that couldn't get ahold of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7629" target="_blank">02:07:09.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So this guy, Beard Guitar, Paul Beard in Maryland, he reached out, fixed my Gretsch

there's also like the, this whole vibe to it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7667" target="_blank">02:07:47.360</a></span> | <span

like a, it's got like a solid core, you know, instead of it being</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7672" target="_blank">02:07:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">a hollow body, like an acoustic, it's got that, it almost looks like a hubcap, that black.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7686" target="_blank">02:08:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7687" target="_blank">02:08:07.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Cooler.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7688" target="_blank">02:08:08.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, the old, I'm real, I'm real fond of like the older music.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7693" target="_blank">02:08:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, um, so like where all my family's from, so my dad was adopted.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7698" target="_blank">02:08:18.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So I don't have any fan, like Lunsford's not really even a real last name to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7701" target="_blank">02:08:21.660</a></span> | <span class="t">They're all just, it was just my grandparents that adopted my dad.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7705" target="_blank">02:08:25.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So all of my family's Engel is like I-N-G-L-E.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7710" target="_blank">02:08:30.180</a></span> | <span class="t">That's like my real, that's all my mom's side of my family.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7713" target="_blank">02:08:33.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And, um, they're all from this place about 20 miles from where like the Carter family was from.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7719" target="_blank">02:08:39.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So all that old Virginia, like kind of bluegrass folk music and stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7725" target="_blank">02:08:45.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I, I was just always attracted to that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7727" target="_blank">02:08:47.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's, I like the, I like the resonator a full step down because it, to me, it kind of gives it that old sound.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7734" target="_blank">02:08:54.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, um, you know, a lot of the instruments back then had like bad dull strings and they were older and they were out of tune a little bit and stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7741" target="_blank">02:09:01.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And I just, I listened to a lot of that type of music.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7743" target="_blank">02:09:03.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So I like, I like the strings being a little out of tune and dull and not everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7747" target="_blank">02:09:07.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And just that, yeah, that's why I was so attracted to it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7751" target="_blank">02:09:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Plus like some of the old blues players, like, you know, playing the dobro and stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7757" target="_blank">02:09:17.140</a></span> | <span class="t">But that was my, that's why I wanted to get the resonator was just because of that old, I mean, that's even why, like, you know, I had to use my grandpa's name as an alias, but that Oliver Anthony music is really supposed to represent like old music from like 1930s Virginia or something like, you know, like it's kind of got that type of feel to it, or at least in its core, you know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7777" target="_blank">02:09:37.020</a></span> | <span class="t">It feels like from another time, but it also feels timeless.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7781" target="_blank">02:09:41.700</a></span> | <span class="t">It's also that my music catalog is so limited.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7784" target="_blank">02:09:44.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Like of what I listened to that a lot of what's in my head, like, cause you think about when you're writing songs and like coming up with chord progressions and stuff, you really, whether you realize it or not, it's all being influenced off of other songs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7795" target="_blank">02:09:55.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So when you only have a lot of older music and like some, a little bit of metal and stuff in there, it's like, there's not really a whole lot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7802" target="_blank">02:10:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like that, you know, it's kind of going to sound that way, I guess, just in any way, cause that's what's in your head already, but.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7808" target="_blank">02:10:08.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So you're going to go out there a little bit this year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7811" target="_blank">02:10:11.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, what, uh, what are some things you're looking forward to?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7816" target="_blank">02:10:16.420</a></span> | <span class="t">You're going to travel a bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7817" target="_blank">02:10:17.580</a></span> | <span class="t">You're going to play a bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7818" target="_blank">02:10:18.620</a></span> | <span class="t">The idea is, is to go to a town.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7821" target="_blank">02:10:21.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Like let's just use Iowa as an example, instead of, instead of the big city in Iowa playing at the venue where everybody books, let's find a farm field, 45 minutes outside of that big city.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7832" target="_blank">02:10:32.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Figure out the ingress, egress, the security, find a good promoter that can like a show organizer, basically that has experience to where it's still, it's still professional and it's done correctly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7841" target="_blank">02:10:41.900</a></span> | <span class="t">But establish like a new venue space that can't be, that can't be put under contract by a monopoly that any artist can go play.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7851" target="_blank">02:10:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Like without, like if, if all these musicians are sick of Ticketmaster and Live Nation, then let's just, let's just start playing in fields and on main streets and set these venues up and establish them correctly and professionally to where they exist as their own space.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7865" target="_blank">02:11:05.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, and then imagine the economic impact that would provide to a town that otherwise would never have, like, and imagine what it, you, you want to talk about trying to give blue collar people like some hope or give them some relatability or do anything for them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7878" target="_blank">02:11:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Like bring a big band to their town that they would otherwise have to drive an hour and a half somewhere to see and couldn't even afford the tickets to start with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7885" target="_blank">02:11:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Like my tour last year, pretty much every show we did that was mine had a $25 ticket option and everybody scoffed at that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7891" target="_blank">02:11:31.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And I just, I was basically like made fun of for that by people in the professional space, even people I was working with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7898" target="_blank">02:11:38.220</a></span> | <span class="t">They just thought it was so stupid, but you know what?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7900" target="_blank">02:11:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">There were people at my shows that came up and the kids were wearing hand-me-down clothes and, and like, you could tell they didn't have any money and they, and they said it meant a lot to them that they could come and that there was a $25 option.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7911" target="_blank">02:11:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, and I'll continue to do these shows like this to where any band that wants to come play the show, all their expenses are covered.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7918" target="_blank">02:11:58.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and I'm sure there's some kind of tax write-off component to them for them, but basically they can come in, do the show, help bring in a crowd.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7926" target="_blank">02:12:06.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Like I'm taking the risk, setting the venue up and establishing it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7930" target="_blank">02:12:10.660</a></span> | <span class="t">The venue will be owned or managed by either the town or the farm or whatever, but it's, it's, it'll be in a nonprofit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7936" target="_blank">02:12:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And then that, that space will always exist for people to rent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7939" target="_blank">02:12:19.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And the idea is, it's like, man, imagine if I did, if I could do 20 of these a year, even if that's, even if that's all I can get done, like that's 20 places that will always have music.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7950" target="_blank">02:12:30.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And we'll always have a center where people can go like, and build this sense of community.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7954" target="_blank">02:12:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">We talked about, like, it's almost like a sanctuary if you want to call it that, but it's like a, it's just a space that can't be perverted by, by corporate America and just a place where people can go and like do all these things that we want to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7967" target="_blank">02:12:47.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, what are you excited for this year?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7970" target="_blank">02:12:50.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Obviously you're going to travel overseas and you got, sounds like you got some, some other cool stuff you're going to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7975" target="_blank">02:12:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7975" target="_blank">02:12:55.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to see, uh, I'm going to see some world leaders, hopefully not end up in prison anywhere.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7981" target="_blank">02:13:01.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, part, part of that, honestly, I'm excited, you know, like India to see the same humans, but in very different parts of the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=7992" target="_blank">02:13:12.340</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not a travel guy, but I love seeing humans that there's like a lot of us humans all over the place and they're very different and they have funny accents and just funny way of being, you know, so I'm excited to take it all in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8006" target="_blank">02:13:26.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Cause I fundamentally love people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8009" target="_blank">02:13:29.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Like I, I, uh, I would definitely say if you're ever up, if you're ever over towards Virginia or West Virginia, either one there, like, yeah, it'd be cool to spend a couple of days out in the woods or a day out in the woods and do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8055" target="_blank">02:14:15.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And just like a stare at a tree for hours.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8060" target="_blank">02:14:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you take mushrooms and like that tree starts like having some more dynamism to it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8067" target="_blank">02:14:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's just a little boost, but like, yeah, I get into this crazy, like I said, it's only been a handful of times.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8072" target="_blank">02:14:32.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Cause I've, I don't know.</span></div><div

little unfamiliar to me, but like, like talking about trees and psilocybin, you know, you think about, you start to look in those trees and you think like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8087" target="_blank">02:14:47.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And their relative perspective of time, you know, cause they're constantly moving around and growing and doing all these things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8092" target="_blank">02:14:52.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And you think about like, in their perspective, maybe we're just, we're just moving way faster than their perception.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8098" target="_blank">02:14:58.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And they're, they're moving at just a normal speed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8100" target="_blank">02:15:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't, it's just, you get into all these crazy trains of thought when you sit out in the woods on that stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8105" target="_blank">02:15:05.560</a></span> | <span class="t">A hundred percent, man.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8106" target="_blank">02:15:06.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, like maybe that's the history of life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8109" target="_blank">02:15:09.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, humans have some chance of destroying 95, 99% of the population with nuclear weapons and the trees will remain and they will reconstruct the environment of earth and help the few humans that remain to survive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8125" target="_blank">02:15:25.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And it'll be the fucking trees that we'd be grateful for their actual deep, ancient, uh, wisdom.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8133" target="_blank">02:15:33.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So maybe they're the intelligent ones.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8136" target="_blank">02:15:36.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe we're the idiots.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8137" target="_blank">02:15:37.460</a></span> | <span class="t">When you're out in nature like that and just reading, just looking at and studying the way all those systems work with soil and trees and animals and how it all just integrates in together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8146" target="_blank">02:15:46.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So perfectly, it does give you some sense of peace that maybe there is some, there is some system at place that's out of our hands that can just help us with our fault, our faults and our repercussions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8156" target="_blank">02:15:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, like for me, just, um, yeah, I think just being out there, especially now that now looking at it through the lens of, of God, of their, you know, of, of God, it helps.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8167" target="_blank">02:16:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">There's, I've found no greater peace than just being out in the woods and, and praying or just, just trying to focus my mind on, on that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OyB3hFb2AA&t=8176" target="_blank">02:16:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Like I, but yeah, I would love
