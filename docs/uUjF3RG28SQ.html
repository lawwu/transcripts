And you can see this in this diagram.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUjF3RG28SQ&t=1145" target="_blank">00:19:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">The blue dots indicate that with time we have more and more of these non-functional cells.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUjF3RG28SQ&t=1153" target="_blank">00:19:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">But what we don't want to touch is what is working. We don't want to deliver these factors to cells that are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUjF3RG28SQ&t=1162" target="_blank">00:19:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">healthy and that are functional.

In a young tissue you almost don't have any of these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUjF3RG28SQ&t=1177" target="_blank">00:19:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">fragile, unhealthy cells.

And this is what we have been doing. There is a specific genes and markers that target and identify the unhealthy cells.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUjF3RG28SQ&t=1191" target="_blank">00:19:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And with these markers we can guide our Yamanaka factors just to the unhealthy cell.

Increasing the buffering capacity</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUjF3RG28SQ&t=1216" target="_blank">00:20:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">of the unhealthy cell. And the last slide that I want to show you is, for instance, an organ like the skin. If we bring</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUjF3RG28SQ&t=1225" target="_blank">00:20:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">these factors to the unhealthy cells of the skin, you see phenotypes like this. For instance, an old mouse like us,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUjF3RG28SQ&t=1234" target="_blank">00:20:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">with time, will get gray hair.

Or if we do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUjF3RG28SQ&t=1254" target="_blank">00:20:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">a wound in the skin of an animal, of a non-animal, and this in us, after a certain age, the wound takes a long time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUjF3RG28SQ&t=1266" target="_blank">00:21:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">to close, or even it doesn't close.
