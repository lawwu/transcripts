Starbucks is a sugar company. For example, a caramel macchiato, 32 grams of sugar. A mocha frappuccino, 60 grams of sugar. This is three times what you're supposed to have as a human in a day.</p><p>And these products also average 400 to 500 calories per drink. So the real issue is that more consumers, as they question the repercussions of consuming a lot of sugar, what will they do as more consumers get on GLP-1s? What will they do as more people think about the fact that fat was never an enemy?</p><p>In fact, fats are actually really good for you. What will consumers do? And I think that's a really big strategic question mark, because the company has to embrace where the world is going. The world is going away from sugar.</p></div></div></body></html>
