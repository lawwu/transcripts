It takes two seconds before someone's inviting you into their home. I think that that's where it just really goes off the chart in terms of value. You're getting far superior service than you would get in almost anywhere in the world.</p><p>The idea of getting invited to someone's home, to me, that seems a little foreign. Is that something that you think people visiting might actually experience if they just got off that kind of standard track? Because it feels a little foreign to think about it. Absolutely. I can't encourage people enough to get out of the hotel, to go and visit archaeological sites, to visit local people, to interact with the locals.</p><p>Even if that means having a local guide, opening your eyes, even speaking to the taxi drivers or your transfer driver, the people in a store, you'll really find an incredible warmth and you'll find and invitations do flow freely.</p></div></div></body></html>
