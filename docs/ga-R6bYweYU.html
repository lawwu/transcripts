So let me set the scene for this story. It's the late 1940s. Walt Disney is going through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=40" target="_blank">00:00:40.860</a></span> | <span class="t">a hard time in his life. So here's a timeline you got to understand. Sort of the apex of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=47" target="_blank">00:00:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">first half of Disney's career was 1937. That is when Snow White and the Seven Doors comes out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=53" target="_blank">00:00:53.740</a></span> | <span class="t">It's the first full-length animated movie. It was the highest grossing movie of all time when it came</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=58" target="_blank">00:00:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">out. So this was a phenomenon. But after that high point, his animation studio had begun to suffer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=65" target="_blank">00:01:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">financial difficulties, in particular because of World War II. So his follow-up films, which we now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=70" target="_blank">00:01:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">see as classics like Fantasia and Pinocchio, they struggled in part because there was no European or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=77" target="_blank">00:01:17.700</a></span> | <span class="t">otherwise international market for these because of the ongoing war. Then we get in the early 1940s,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=83" target="_blank">00:01:23.240</a></span> | <span class="t">this big animator strike at Disney Studios. This was really traumatic for Disney. Several of his</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=88" target="_blank">00:01:28.360</a></span> | <span class="t">biographers, including my favorite biographer of his, Neil Gabler's, talks about how this really was a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=93" target="_blank">00:01:33.640</a></span> | <span class="t">period of emotional and creative malaise for Disney. He felt betrayed. He felt drained. So here we are,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=100" target="_blank">00:01:40.860</a></span> | <span class="t">as the 40s wear on, the high point of the animation studio is down. They're struggling. They were having to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.500</a></span> | <span class="t">do, I don't know if you've ever seen this before, Jesse, but they were doing propaganda videos on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=111" target="_blank">00:01:51.700</a></span> | <span class="t">contract for the government, animated propaganda videos because they needed the money. So there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.300</a></span> | <span class="t">nothing really exciting going on. They were always short on money. He felt betrayed. He's not having a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.120</a></span> | <span class="t">great time. Then came the trains. So Disney was fascinated with steam trains. This is not unusual for someone who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.460</a></span> | <span class="t">was born near the turn of the 20th century. You have to imagine what it was like if you're Disney's age.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.580</a></span> | <span class="t">When you were growing up in the 1920s, right? Steam engines were magic, right? Think about it. You had</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.360</a></span> | <span class="t">horse transportation. That's all anyone had ever known for centuries. And suddenly you have these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.540</a></span> | <span class="t">massive machines. You've never seen something like this. They were blowing and hissing steam like a dragon</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.780</a></span> | <span class="t">of a size that you've rarely seen anything man-made that large. It could actually move.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And they could rush across the landscape 60, 70, 80 miles per hour, pulling these massive lines of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.860</a></span> | <span class="t">freight over giant trestle bridges. I mean, it was the thing. There was nothing else to be as amazed by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">in the period when Disney grew up than it was trains. So like many people from his era, he always had had</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.980</a></span> | <span class="t">a fascination with trains. He worked selling papers on a train for a while as a kid. And so he bought,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.340</a></span> | <span class="t">he was 46 years old. It's 1940. He's not feeling good. He buys a Lionel train set. You know, the what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.640</a></span> | <span class="t">do you call model trains you set up? He's like, oh, this is kind of fun. Then he discovers that one of his</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">animators, Ward Kimball, was essentially building a full-size steam engine in his backyard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And this started to get Disney going like, well, wait a second, what are you doing here? And so he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">travels with Kimball. They go to a train show where I think I forgot exactly where this was. It might've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">been Chicago. It might've been, um, somewhere in the Midwest, but it was a train show where they were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">bringing together all these like great steam engines from times past. And it was like really amazing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And he saw that, uh, Ward Kimball was building like a fake set in his backyard to put the steam engine. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.540</a></span> | <span class="t">and Disney felt something that he hadn't felt in a little while, which was a spark of inspiration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And so he hatched a plan. He said, I'm going to build not a model train, but a 1/8 scale train. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.500</a></span> | <span class="t">to put that in the perspective, a 1/8 scale train, the, uh, engine is just big enough that like a full</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.940</a></span> | <span class="t">grown man, you could sit on it and you know, your legs would kind of be over the side, but so it's like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.500</a></span> | <span class="t">the size of, I don't know. You think of it as like a wagon, right? So he was like, I'm going to build a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.300</a></span> | <span class="t">train at that scale and I'm going to build a track to run this thing on. Now he didn't have enough room</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.540</a></span> | <span class="t">where they lived. So he bought a new house, right? This is 1949. Disney purchases a five acre plot in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Los Angeles specifically because the land would be well suited for building this 1/8 scale train that he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.420</a></span> | <span class="t">suddenly had come up with is like, this will be fun. He laid out nearly 800 meters of track for his steam</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.620</a></span> | <span class="t">engine, which he called the Carolwood Pacific railroad because it was on Carolwood Avenue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.620</a></span> | <span class="t">He ended up with a 46 foot long trestle. So that's a old school railroad bridge that was large enough</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.460</a></span> | <span class="t">that it fell under LA County's jurisdiction as a real bridge. They had to actually check that it was properly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.660</a></span> | <span class="t">built, had loops and overpasses, a gradient, an elevated dirt berm and a 90 foot tunnel underneath</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.740</a></span> | <span class="t">his wife's flower bed. They engineered the tunnel at great expense to have an S turn so that when you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=319" target="_blank">00:05:19.620</a></span> | <span class="t">went in one end, you couldn't see out the backs. You had no idea how long it felt like the tunnel was going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.620</a></span> | <span class="t">on and on for a long time. We have some photos, I think, right, Jesse, of this track. So if you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.700</a></span> | <span class="t">watching this on YouTube, instead of just listening, we're going to see if we can pull up on the screen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Jesse will pull up while we're talking here some photos from an article I found that were pretty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.460</a></span> | <span class="t">good. And so, yeah, so we see here, there he is on the train. So that's what 1/8 scale is. You see,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.580</a></span> | <span class="t">he's riding on it, but close to the ground. All right, scroll some more, Jesse. That's the layout.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Look at that. Oh, I'm so jealous. And then you see here, there's his barn. If you're watching,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=358" target="_blank">00:05:58.100</a></span> | <span class="t">keep that barn in mind. I'll mention that in a second. I think there's like maybe one more photo on there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, there they are going by the flower beds. All right. So amid this circuit,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Disney also built a barn where he could store and maintain his rolling stock.

And as long as he was building it, he designed it to look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.020</a></span> | <span class="t">like his family barn he had growing up in Marceline, Missouri. This also became a place for him to relax and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=386" target="_blank">00:06:26.260</a></span> | <span class="t">the brainstorm about future projects.

He argues that there is value in doing things spontaneously instead of having</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=2192" target="_blank">00:36:32.500</a></span> | <span class="t">scheduled time for it. You won't be in the mood to do that thing when the time arrives. He also mentions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=2197" target="_blank">00:36:37.300</a></span> | <span class="t">that being able to do something that you want at the moment you want it is liberating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=2201" target="_blank">00:36:41.780</a></span> | <span class="t">He does embody the removing the unnecessary overhead part of where he has no meetings,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=2208" target="_blank">00:36:48.820</a></span> | <span class="t">etc., but says that the overly scheduled life is not worth living. Does this contradict with the deep life?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=2215" target="_blank">00:36:55.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, not to be spicy and like every one of my answers today, and maybe it's this New England air,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=2222" target="_blank">00:37:02.660</a></span> | <span class="t">but Naval is basically describing the life of like an 18th century aristocrat. Yes. If you're a moneyed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=2234" target="_blank">00:37:14.660</a></span> | <span class="t">gentleman.

I think that captured the main things. Okay. If you're the type of person that would come</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=2245" target="_blank">00:37:25.140</a></span> | <span class="t">calling in a Jane Austen novel. Sure. It's probably right. This is like a great way of living, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=2253" target="_blank">00:37:33.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Because our income comes from our investments and we have freedom of time and we want to use the time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=2259" target="_blank">00:37:39.940</a></span> | <span class="t">in the highest ways. And to have a day that's overly scheduled, it probably is like not as life-affirming</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=2266" target="_blank">00:37:46.100</a></span> | <span class="t">as sort of taking the interest as it arises and pursuing it.

It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=2372" target="_blank">00:39:32.340</a></span> | <span class="t">diligent work.

I'm sure Naval went through all this when he was an early stage</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=2381" target="_blank">00:39:41.460</a></span> | <span class="t">investor making his moves early on and trying to understand the market and get in on these early</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=2386" target="_blank">00:39:46.180</a></span> | <span class="t">startups.

So anyways, I'm sure Naval is right that, uh, it is very liberating not to have a schedule.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=2396" target="_blank">00:39:56.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And actually you would enjoy a lot about your life in the moment, but most of us don't have that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga-R6bYweYU&t=2401" target="_blank">00:40:01.380</a></span> | <span class="t">opportunity.
