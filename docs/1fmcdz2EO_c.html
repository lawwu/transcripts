And fundamentally the unlock is that it can act</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fmcdz2EO_c&t=54" target="_blank">00:00:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">coherently for long enough to write multiple files of code or what has changed between now and then?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fmcdz2EO_c&t=59" target="_blank">00:00:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Most of the training data is more like doing single steps at a time. And I would expect us to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fmcdz2EO_c&t=65" target="_blank">00:01:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">do more for training the models to carry out these longer projects. So I'd say any kind of training,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fmcdz2EO_c&t=74" target="_blank">00:01:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">any like doing RL to learn how to do these tasks, however you do it, whether it's,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fmcdz2EO_c&t=80" target="_blank">00:01:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">whether you're supervising the final output or supervising it, like each step, I think any kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fmcdz2EO_c&t=86" target="_blank">00:01:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">of training at carrying out these long projects is going to make them a lot better. And since</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fmcdz2EO_c&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the whole area is pretty new, I'd say there's just a lot of low-hanging fruit in doing this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fmcdz2EO_c&t=100" target="_blank">00:01:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of training. So I'd say that's one thing. Also, I would expect that as the models get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fmcdz2EO_c&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">better, they're just better at recovering from errors or they have just, they're better at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fmcdz2EO_c&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">dealing with dealing with edge cases or when things go wrong, they know how to recover from it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fmcdz2EO_c&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So the models will be more sample efficient. So you don't have to collect a ton of data to teach</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fmcdz2EO_c&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.240</a></span> | <span class="t">them how to get back on track. Just a little bit of data or, or just their like generalization from,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fmcdz2EO_c&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">from other abilities will allow them to get back on the track, on track. Whereas current models</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fmcdz2EO_c&t=138" target="_blank">00:02:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">might just get stuck and get lost. I'm not sure I understood actually how,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fmcdz2EO_c&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to understand more explicitly how the generalization helps you get back on track.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fmcdz2EO_c&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. If you collect a diverse dataset, you're going to get a little bit of everything in it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fmcdz2EO_c&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And, and if you have models that generalize really well, even if there's just a couple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fmcdz2EO_c&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">examples of getting back on track, I see, or even like maybe in the pre-training,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fmcdz2EO_c&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">there's examples of getting back on track. Then like the model will be able to generalize from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fmcdz2EO_c&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">those other things it's seen to the current situation. So I think like if you have models</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fmcdz2EO_c&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">that are weaker, you might be able to get them to do almost anything with enough data, but you might</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fmcdz2EO_c&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">have to put a lot of effort into a particular domain or skill. Whereas for a stronger model,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fmcdz2EO_c&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">it might just do the right thing without any training data or any effort.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fmcdz2EO_c&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Right now we have models that are on a per token basis, pretty smart.

And the thing that prevents them from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fmcdz2EO_c&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">being as useful as they could be is that five minutes from now, they're not going to be so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fmcdz2EO_c&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">writing your code in a way that's coherent and aligns with the broader goals you have for your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fmcdz2EO_c&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.040</a></span> | <span class="t">project or something. If it's the case that once you start this long horizon RL training regime,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fmcdz2EO_c&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">it immediately unlocks your ability to be coherent for longer periods of time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fmcdz2EO_c&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Should we be predicting something that is human level as soon as that regime is unlocked?

I would think there'll be other miscellaneous deficits that the models have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fmcdz2EO_c&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that cause them to get stuck or not make progress or make worse decisions than humans.
