It's not just about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-VR5C0dqnU&t=54" target="_blank">00:00:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">some people are able to white knuckle it and some people are weak.

There's a couple of things I want to focus on here as being important. One has to do with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-VR5C0dqnU&t=64" target="_blank">00:01:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">how you choose what you work on. One has to do with how you build a lifestyle or approach actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-VR5C0dqnU&t=70" target="_blank">00:01:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">working on it. So let's start with the choice question. And then the second piece will cover</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-VR5C0dqnU&t=74" target="_blank">00:01:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">more. That's going to overlap more with the central theme of today's episode about cultivating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-VR5C0dqnU&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">discipline as a mindset. But let's start first with the choice of project. Oftentimes, especially</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-VR5C0dqnU&t=85" target="_blank">00:01:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">for young people and for how you say here, you're 21 years old. So that that counts as you, you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-VR5C0dqnU&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">half Jesse and I's age, which is its own psychological issue for Jesse and I to deal with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-VR5C0dqnU&t=97" target="_blank">00:01:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">But don't worry about that. For someone who's young like you, you have to be very careful in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-VR5C0dqnU&t=102" target="_blank">00:01:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">what you choose to work on. So there's a couple of things that is going to potentially short circuit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-VR5C0dqnU&t=108" target="_blank">00:01:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">your motivation. One is you just set too much stuff on your plate. Yeah, I'm going to do this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-VR5C0dqnU&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and this and this because I can't wait to get started and I want to work on all these things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-VR5C0dqnU&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And I just want to get really motivated and go for it. And your mind gets exhausted and says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-VR5C0dqnU&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">we can't be starting a business and AC in our classes and writing a book and training to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-VR5C0dqnU&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">in really good shape. It's just too many things. The energy involved in trying to keep up with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-VR5C0dqnU&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">these things is too much. And it just seems intractable and forget it. Motivation is gone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-VR5C0dqnU&t=138" target="_blank">00:02:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">The other type of issue that happens here is that your mind, you maybe have one or two things. It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-VR5C0dqnU&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">not the quantity, but your mind doesn't trust your plan for execution. You're like, yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-VR5C0dqnU&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to look like Thor, but all you're doing is sort of just randomly going to the gym and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-VR5C0dqnU&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of lifting weights. And your mind's like, you don't know what this is not going to lead</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-VR5C0dqnU&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">the Thor. We're not going to look, we're just doing random stuff. Or you say, I want to be a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-VR5C0dqnU&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">famous writer and you're sort of writing every day.

We're not going to become a famous writer doing this. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-VR5C0dqnU&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">once your initial, just general excitement about being a writer dies off, we're going to withhold</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-VR5C0dqnU&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">motivation. And then you're going to find yourself falling off. So being careful about how you choose</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-VR5C0dqnU&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">what you work on a reasonable load, and then study what you work on and make sure that your plan for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-VR5C0dqnU&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">approaching it is evidence-based and logical that your mind will trust. Yeah, we're going to get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-VR5C0dqnU&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.080</a></span> | <span class="t">results with what we're doing. And to get there, especially if you're young, might mean bringing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-VR5C0dqnU&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">your ambition down and aiming at a much closer milestone. So it's not, I want the Pulitzer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-VR5C0dqnU&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Prize. It's, I want to be a regular contributor to the college magazine. So you bring it down to a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-VR5C0dqnU&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">more proximate goal. You have a plan to get there that your mind trusts. So the choice of things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-VR5C0dqnU&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">matter if you want to have your motivation be sustained.

In fact,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-VR5C0dqnU&t=773" target="_blank">00:12:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">in my new book, Slow Productivity, which is coming out in March, there's a whole principle</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-VR5C0dqnU&t=777" target="_blank">00:12:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">is about working at a natural pace and it really gets into seasonality and how natural and well</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-VR5C0dqnU&t=781" target="_blank">00:13:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">suited humans are for that. So I do want to throw that in there. You might just be getting exhausted,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-VR5C0dqnU&t=786" target="_blank">00:13:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">right? Like a professor, by the time a professor gets to the end of spring, traditionally,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-VR5C0dqnU&t=790" target="_blank">00:13:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">they're exhausted because they've gone through a full school year. So to actually pull back some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-VR5C0dqnU&t=794" target="_blank">00:13:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">in the summer makes sense because you need to recharge. If you try to go all out in the summer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-VR5C0dqnU&t=798" target="_blank">00:13:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">after a hard spring and after a hard fall before that, you might just run out of steam altogether.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-VR5C0dqnU&t=803" target="_blank">00:13:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think seasonal workload could be fine as well. So let's throw that in here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-VR5C0dqnU&t=806" target="_blank">00:13:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">not just as an epilogue, but I'm going to throw this in, Jacob, as my third part of my answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-VR5C0dqnU&t=810" target="_blank">00:13:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Make your workload seasonal, but keep the systems the same. You're still multi-scale planning,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-VR5C0dqnU&t=815" target="_blank">00:13:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">but when you get to some months of the year, the amount of stuff you're putting into your week,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-VR5C0dqnU&t=819" target="_blank">00:13:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the complexity of your daily time block schedules are much easier. And you get that relief of,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-VR5C0dqnU&t=822" target="_blank">00:13:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">man, this feels great. I can really control my time. I'm taking Thursdays completely off because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-VR5C0dqnU&t=827" target="_blank">00:13:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">why not? I'm using planning so I can move pieces around. This is great. I can actually extract a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-VR5C0dqnU&t=832" target="_blank">00:13:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">lot more relaxation and recharging because I have some structure. So I think a seasonal workload</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-VR5C0dqnU&t=837" target="_blank">00:13:57.120</a></span> | <span class="t">could be excellent, but you don't want your systems to come and go seasonally. And you want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-VR5C0dqnU&t=841" target="_blank">00:14:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">to make sure that your mindset is one that doesn't require external power. So there we go. I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-VR5C0dqnU&t=846" target="_blank">00:14:06.240</a></span> | <span class="t">upgraded this from two parts to three parts, Jacob, and hopefully you will find that useful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-VR5C0dqnU&t=851" target="_blank">00:14:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">All right.
