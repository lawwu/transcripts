Take down the recording from YouTube." That happened. That is a violation of the Constitution of the United States.</p><p>That is against everything in the traditions and laws and culture of the United States. That is outrageous. And yet it happened. An injunction issued in a court case last year, Missouri et al versus Biden et al. The argument made in the court case, which the judge accepted, which is extremely well-supported by the record in front of him, is that various actors within the United States government puppeted the tech companies and used them as cat's paws to do, frankly, shocking violations of constitutionally protected freedoms like the freedom of speech.</p><p>And that they were not on the level of, "We've built this unaccountable, hard-to-inspect system of LLMs and heuristics, and we started turning off a lot of people's feeds and Facebook." But no, there was an individual person in the White House who was sending out emails like, "When are you going to address me on this tweet, guys?</p><p>We can't have things like this anymore," et cetera, et cetera. Again, a feature of the United States, we are very good about keeping records and transparency and having a functioning legal system. And the record before the court is like, "I was following along as this was happening, and what was happening was much worse than I understood to be happening." This is literally written in the decision, by the way, which I would urge everyone to read.</p><p>There was an individual in a non-governmental organization which was collaborating with the governmental organizations in doing this, which said, "To get around legal uncertainty, comma, including very real First Amendment concerns, comma, in our ability to do this, rather than doing it in the government directly, we are outsourcing it to a bunch of college students who we have hired under the auspices of this program." What?</p><p>One, just as a dangerous professional here, you violated the character from The Wire, Stringer Bell. Stringer Bell's dictum on the wisdom of taking notes on a criminal conspiracy. But you literally wrote that down in an email. The outrageous part is not that you wrote that down in an email.</p><p>The outrageous part is you, with full knowledge of it, engaged in something that is outrageously unconstitutional, immoral, illegal, and evil, to the applause of people in your social circle. And everyone involved in the story thinks that they're the good guy in it. If you write that email, you are not the good guy in the story.</p><p>One thing in the judicial record of this case is that the White House and other government actors routinely overreached and asked the tech companies, "We would like you to censor this and this and this and this." And the tech companies said no in a bunch of cases. And so continuing to negotiate for the right outcome rather than the one that people in power merely want is important.</p><p>Maybe we should have spoken out more and spoken more boldly about it. Maybe when it was like the routine case that the White House was telling Facebook, Twitter, et cetera, et cetera, everyone knows the names. Companies on a tweet-by-tweet, communication-by-communication basis, giving direct orders on, "There's a certain kind of speech act which we find vexatious, and we would like you to stop that everywhere." Very plausibly you should get on the nightly news and say, "I received the following email from the White House that says we should stop this everywhere.</p><p>If you point a gun at me, I will comply with this at the point of a gun. That is what it will take." It almost requires civil disobedience in the sense of they publish this email, like, "Here's what the White House just sent me," they take down this tweet, and now Twitter's market cap has just collapsed because people realize the political implications of what Jack Dorsey just got up and said at the time.</p><p>Then the solution is that tech companies need to basically sacrifice their capacity to do business. You need to have a risk tolerance, right? Every business everywhere, including in the financial industry, including in the tech industry, is balancing various risks, and the risk tolerance was poorly calibrated. One can achieve results in the world by doing things like embarrassing government officials, and embarrassing a person in a position of authority is not a zero-risk behavior.</p><p>It is relatively low-risk in the United States relative to other places. Maybe we need to have a certain amount of intestinal fortitude, like a, "Okay, you've asked us to do something. You've threatened us with taking away all the wonderful toys and the great business models that make this an extremely lucrative area to work in, and to sacrifice a value that is very important for us to continue to do that.</p><p>No, we're going to fight you on this one." The comms-trained part of me is like, "Don't use the word 'fight'." We are going to collaborate with stakeholders across civil society to achieve an optimal outcome balancing the multiple disparate and legitimate interests of various arms of the government and civil society and blah, blah, blah.</p><p>Sometimes that requires fighting. We should fight when it does.</p></div></div></body></html>
