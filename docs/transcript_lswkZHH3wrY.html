I find it often to be like a good jumping off point. Like it'll help me know the right thing to ask about. It's good as a reference. So hypertext is a very effective navigational aid.</p><p>It can help you get to a spot that you're looking for very quickly because it's about automating, flipping through pages. And so for a reference, it's very effective. If what you have is a table of chemical compounds and their properties, hypertext is gonna let you navigate that book very effectively.</p><p>Likewise, dictionaries have been revolutionized by hypertext. So navigating around the sources by clicking on links to say like, "Oh, shade it a little bit more like that." That's like a much better source. There are certain kinds of text that are more amenable to hypertext because they are more amenable to having the reader dropped in the middle of them.</p><p>Encyclopedias are like that, dictionaries are like that. Most text is not like that. Most concepts are not like that.</p></div></div></body></html>
