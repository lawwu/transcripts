You're not going to get through this thing called life without them, at least not successfully. And if you look at the world we live in right now, rising rates of depression and anxiety, inability to cope with stress, in the worst case scenario, suicide, what you find is that friendship fixes all those things.</p><p>It's the ultimate biohack. Even the obsession with longevity. You know, you've got everybody talking about diets and exercises and supplements, and yet nobody's talking about friends. And if you look at all the blue zones and all of those things, yes, they're eating these vegetarian diets, yes, they walk a lot, but they also commune, they also eat with friends, they also walk with friends.</p><p>And I've met so many people who've lived to old age, who didn't do any of the things that the biohackers in Hollywood do, and they're in their 90s, and they're happy, and they're healthy, and they're walking around, and you hear them laugh and talk about their friends. And so I think that we forget about friendship, because it's a little more amorphous, can't measure it as easily.</p><p>You know, we live in a metrics-obsessed world. We're so metrics-obsessed, we forget that some of the harder-to-measure, more qualitative, beautiful things in life actually contribute to our health.</p></div></div></body></html>
