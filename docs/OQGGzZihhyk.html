So I got a lot of good feedback.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So the deep life stack, I was I was proposing a more elaborated understanding of my philosophy of how to cultivate a deep life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And I introduced this notion of a deep life stack where you build these layers sequentially one after another,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.280</a></span> | <span class="t">as opposed to just jumping right into rejiggering parts of your life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, I'll bring up on the screen now the version of the stack I drew in last week's episode.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=347" target="_blank">00:05:47.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're listening and want to see what's on the screen, this is episode 253.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So go to YouTube.com/CalNewportMedia and search for episode 253 or go to the deep life.com and look for episode 253.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So what you'll see on the screen was the stack I drew on Monday, Monday.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know when it was last week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So we had discipline, values, calm and plan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=370" target="_blank">00:06:10.520</a></span> | <span class="t">The idea was you worked your way up the stack en route to cultivating a deeper life and then you iterate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=375" target="_blank">00:06:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a process we keep iterating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.840</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, I sent this out for feedback to you, my listeners.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I got a lot of good feedback.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So one of the things I want to try, the change I want to try today,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=385" target="_blank">00:06:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">one of many iterations I'm sure will be coming in the months ahead,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">is tweaking the description of these stacks away from just a single word to something with a verb.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=396" target="_blank">00:06:36.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So I want to try relabeling each of the layers here with a verb, an actual action,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=404" target="_blank">00:06:44.120</a></span> | <span class="t">as opposed to just a noun and see if this maybe clarifies things even more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=409" target="_blank">00:06:49.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So I have this on the screen now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=411" target="_blank">00:06:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to start with the very bottom layer, which is discipline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=416" target="_blank">00:06:56.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm erasing the word discipline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=419" target="_blank">00:06:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, and I'm going to rewrite.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=421" target="_blank">00:07:01.440</a></span> | <span class="t">There's so many cables in here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=424" target="_blank">00:07:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't want to mess with our feed here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=425" target="_blank">00:07:05.880</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, there we go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=426" target="_blank">00:07:06.440</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, let's rewrite here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=429" target="_blank">00:07:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm changing the label with my brilliantly neat handwriting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=435" target="_blank">00:07:15.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So it used to say discipline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=438" target="_blank">00:07:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Now it says establish or in parentheses reestablish discipline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=446" target="_blank">00:07:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=447" target="_blank">00:07:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's a verb here now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=448" target="_blank">00:07:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It's what are you trying to do as you work through the first layer of the Deep Life stack is you're trying to either re-get in touch with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=456" target="_blank">00:07:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">or establish from scratch a sense of I am someone who is able to do something hard in the moment towards something that is meaningful or important in the long term.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=468" target="_blank">00:07:48.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is where, as we talked about last time, you're going to, first of all, set up your central repository where you keep track of all of your commitments in this journey.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=475" target="_blank">00:07:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And you're going to initiate that central repository with a few seed disciplines, a small number of things that are important, that are hard, but not impossible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=486" target="_blank">00:08:06.120</a></span> | <span class="t">That you are pursuing regularly just to reset your sense of self, just to reset your energy towards, okay, I am someone who can make progress towards hard things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=496" target="_blank">00:08:16.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I am a disciplined person.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=498" target="_blank">00:08:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Now I'm going to take the next layer, which was originally called values.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=504" target="_blank">00:08:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And I erased a little bit of the box there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=505" target="_blank">00:08:25.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'll put that back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=507" target="_blank">00:08:27.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm going to replace that with a verb.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, if you're watching episode 253, you'll actually see my penmanship in action.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=514" target="_blank">00:08:34.760</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, I'm writing in a new description for this layer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=517" target="_blank">00:08:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So where it used to just say values, I now say build a foundation of values.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=524" target="_blank">00:08:44.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So I've just added an active verb here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=529" target="_blank">00:08:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">You're building a foundation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=530" target="_blank">00:08:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the goal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=531" target="_blank">00:08:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, what is this foundation?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=532" target="_blank">00:08:52.440</a></span> | <span class="t">It's going to be something that clarifies what in this part of your life your values are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=536" target="_blank">00:08:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">This is going to include your code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=537" target="_blank">00:08:57.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It's going to include rituals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=538" target="_blank">00:08:58.360</a></span> | <span class="t">It's going to include routines.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=539" target="_blank">00:08:59.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But what's active here is you're building the foundation on which everything else will be built.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=544" target="_blank">00:09:04.040</a></span> | <span class="t">A lot of people ask, why not do that first?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=546" target="_blank">00:09:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Why is discipline coming first?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=548" target="_blank">00:09:08.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Because discipline is changing your sense of self so that everything else is possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=551" target="_blank">00:09:11.720</a></span> | <span class="t">It's setting up the central repository where you're going to write down everything you commit to doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=556" target="_blank">00:09:16.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But more importantly, it's where you change your rhythm of life towards one where I'm doing this with my exercise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=562" target="_blank">00:09:22.800</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:09:26.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's what leads me to believe that everything else is possible too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=570" target="_blank">00:09:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's why I'm maintaining discipline first.</span></div><div class="c"><span

Like that's part of the lineup. You've got to show up. So even if you're busy, even if things are a little chaotic at home, you will go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2095" target="_blank">00:34:55.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's not going to push happens.

That was the whole game that was going to make that doable for her.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2249" target="_blank">00:37:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So, yeah, that particular professor, I mean, you know, she was in the tenure window trying to get her research and her publications, as you're well aware.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2256" target="_blank">00:37:36.520</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, it takes time and, you know, and she had to teach and she had to deal with in her particular case.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2262" target="_blank">00:37:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">She was a professor of education and she was helping to train young teachers, which, as you can imagine, as she's supervising them, there's a million things that can go wrong with that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2271" target="_blank">00:37:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's a lot of a lot of back and forth. So it was hard to find that deep work time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2275" target="_blank">00:37:55.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, she suggested these very small slivers a couple of times a week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2279" target="_blank">00:37:59.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm like, yeah, I don't I don't think you're getting tenure in that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2282" target="_blank">00:38:02.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But. She, you know, this gets at something which is interesting, because I think I'm not sure how many, you know, men and women difference here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2292" target="_blank">00:38:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but I'm not sure how many men who are in the tenure window at major universities would be thinking that they should be picking up their kids from school every day at three o'clock.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2300" target="_blank">00:38:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Like that strikes me as sort of the kind of thing that maybe many of those men wouldn't be considering should be on their plate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2306" target="_blank">00:38:26.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it was kind of interesting to me that she thought it should be on her plate every day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2311" target="_blank">00:38:31.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And obviously, yeah, just doing it most days, but just not a couple of days.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2314" target="_blank">00:38:34.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. You're saying a man of that situation might have just said, well, this is not going to work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2318" target="_blank">00:38:38.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I can't do this every day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2319" target="_blank">00:38:39.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have to either hire someone or figure out how to how to swap this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2323" target="_blank">00:38:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">They would be more likely to just. Advocate for, hey, there's got to be I want I need that time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2329" target="_blank">00:38:49.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. And so she needed somebody to point that out to her, because I think she just didn't have it in her mind that since she, you know, it's a flexible job, unless you're teaching, you could go do something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2340" target="_blank">00:39:00.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it just needed to be pointed out that just because you can do something doesn't always mean you should.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2346" target="_blank">00:39:06.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. And then also, I believe she did. The other element of this is just working out with her husband.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2350" target="_blank">00:39:10.520</a></span> | <span class="t">It was like Saturday morning or Sunday morning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2352" target="_blank">00:39:12.840</a></span> | <span class="t">We just had consistently this three hours, which he didn't mind at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2357" target="_blank">00:39:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, yeah, that's great. Just great routine with the kids on, like, Saturday morning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2360" target="_blank">00:39:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">We go do something. But that was another consistent block.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2364" target="_blank">00:39:24.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. And part of the upside, then, of having multiple blocks is when something inevitably goes wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2369" target="_blank">00:39:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, one of her student teachers had some disaster that she has to then deal with. She wouldn't lose all her research time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2377" target="_blank">00:39:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, the problem is people carve out like one four hour block for research.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2381" target="_blank">00:39:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, it doesn't take a genius to figure out something's going to go wrong at least some of the weeks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2386" target="_blank">00:39:46.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And so if you only have one slot, it won't happen maybe at least a third of the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2390" target="_blank">00:39:50.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you have two slots, if you have three slots, the odds that all three disappear are pretty low.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2398" target="_blank">00:39:58.200</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. So that let's get in the questions then, because I'm looking at the questions we have here from my listeners.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2402" target="_blank">00:40:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">The first question is actually from a professor who's a mom who's struggling with this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2407" target="_blank">00:40:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I think we've we've queued it up. It wasn't my plan. But now that I'm looking at this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2410" target="_blank">00:40:10.840</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. This is a this is a long question. So I might try to edit here a little bit on the fly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2415" target="_blank">00:40:15.560</a></span> | <span class="t">This is from someone who says calls herself Professor Mommy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2418" target="_blank">00:40:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. My academic career is currently going well, but things are complicated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2423" target="_blank">00:40:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I had a two point five year old when I started my faculty position and I've had two additional babies in the past three years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2430" target="_blank">00:40:30.840</a></span> | <span class="t">My kids are now six, three and nine months. I'm assuming, by the way, she means six and three years old and nine months.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2437" target="_blank">00:40:37.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I always I always like the ambiguous modifiers. Three years. Nine months. Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2441" target="_blank">00:40:41.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I was I was about to be very impressed. OK. Childcare is not an issue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2445" target="_blank">00:40:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">My oldest is in elementary school and the little ones are in daycare. I also have the most supportive husband in the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2450" target="_blank">00:40:50.280</a></span> | <span class="t">But I feel like two kids was manageable, but three is utterly chaotic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2455" target="_blank">00:40:55.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I felt like we went from having two kids to having 30. We just go through cycle after cycle of illness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2462" target="_blank">00:41:02.200</a></span> | <span class="t">My husband and I basically take turns working and taking care of the sick kids.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2466" target="_blank">00:41:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">My PhD advisor told me when I was a graduate student that I would need to accept being a mediocre professor and mother if I were to pursue both.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2474" target="_blank">00:41:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I now totally understand what she meant.

I assume, Laura, you're going to say wake up at 4 a.m. and work harder.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2495" target="_blank">00:41:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">But you can correct me if I'm wrong. I'm going to go ahead and correct you here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2499" target="_blank">00:41:39.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, I would say, OK, the first thing, a couple of things come to mind is like, boy, your your advisor had her own issues.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2504" target="_blank">00:41:44.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So I can't believe that anyone who is in a mentoring capacity would decide to say this to an ambitious young woman in her care.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2513" target="_blank">00:41:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But we'll leave that aside. And by the way, the vast majority of female professors have families.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2521" target="_blank">00:42:01.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And there is many anyways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2523" target="_blank">00:42:03.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a it's a it's a very absolute statement which doesn't seem to match the reality of think of any famous female academic that comes to mind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2531" target="_blank">00:42:11.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Almost certainly they also have a family. So. All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2535" target="_blank">00:42:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. All right. So let's roll forward from there. Yes, I would tell this woman.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2540" target="_blank">00:42:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And first of all, I would not draw any harsh conclusions about life when you have a child under the age of one, because this is you're in the thick of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2550" target="_blank">00:42:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Like you just had a baby nine months ago. The baby is most likely not reliably sleeping through the night.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2556" target="_blank">00:42:36.840</a></span> | <span class="t">She may still be nursing. Like there's just all sorts of things that are challenging in the first year or so of life that will get better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2566" target="_blank">00:42:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can see that, you know, you're like, oh, three is so much harder than two.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2570" target="_blank">00:42:50.680</a></span> | <span class="t">No, the older two were older. Right. And that's what made it feel like it was manageable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2576" target="_blank">00:42:56.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And now you've added an infant back into the mix. And so you're going through the chaos again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2580" target="_blank">00:43:00.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm telling you that in another two years or so, it will be calmed down. You'll be like, oh, these people are wonderful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2587" target="_blank">00:43:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know. Maybe you'll decide to have a fourth at that point because you will forgotten.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2590" target="_blank">00:43:10.040</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, it's going to be easier in the future.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2595" target="_blank">00:43:15.400</a></span> | <span class="t">The other thing that struck out to me, she did say that child care is not an issue, but on some level it is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2603" target="_blank">00:43:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Because kids get really sick in daycare. And it's not that the daycare is doing anything wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2611" target="_blank">00:43:31.560</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just when you have, you know, eight toddlers in a class together, they're all touching the same things and putting them in their mouth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2618" target="_blank">00:43:38.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's nothing you can do about it. It's going to give them great immune systems later in their life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2623" target="_blank">00:43:43.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm reading here three year old, three year old in twenty, twenty three.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2629" target="_blank">00:43:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's likely that this year might have been the first time this three year old has been so because you had covid before that or.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2635" target="_blank">00:43:55.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I wouldn't be surprised if you have a completely untrained, a new immune system thrown for the first time in the daycare is it's like in a zombie movie.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2646" target="_blank">00:44:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just everyone is like collapsed on the ground with blood coming out of their eyes. It's just impossible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2650" target="_blank">00:44:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. So that's what I saw with three year old is this may be an unusually bad.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2655" target="_blank">00:44:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And also this year was very bad in general nationwide because of the the immunity debt thing with covid.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2661" target="_blank">00:44:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So everyone had more sicknesses than normal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2664" target="_blank">00:44:24.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's a there's a bad combination going here, probably that this might be unusually bad with the sickness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2669" target="_blank">00:44:29.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. And so one thing that occurred to me, I mean, I again, I don't know what her husband does and sort of where she is in the professor world in terms of what she might be earning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2680" target="_blank">00:44:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But. All right, so we we got cut off there temporarily, if you're listening at home, but we are we are now back connected, I think, right around the time we were disconnected, I was just making the point that I saw the age of three, that one of the one of the question askers kids was three.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2698" target="_blank">00:44:58.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And probably that means they were in a daycare situation probably for the first time this year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2704" target="_blank">00:45:04.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was already a year that was really bad with sickness, which was all just underscoring Laura's point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2710" target="_blank">00:45:10.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Sicknesses with kids is a big issue, but there's also periods in which it is essentially unmanageably high volume.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2718" target="_blank">00:45:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's not like that all the time.

But I mean, one one thing I do wind up talking with a lot of families about is potentially switching the child care option.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2732" target="_blank">00:45:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">If you have multiple kids, you have two parents earning reasonable incomes, you might look into hiring a nanny as opposed to doing daycare.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2741" target="_blank">00:45:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you already have two kids in daycare and maybe you're paying for aftercare for a child in elementary school, it might not be that different of a cost by the time you have all those factored in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2752" target="_blank">00:45:52.520</a></span> | <span class="t">The upside of that is that, you know, they won't be getting the illnesses in the daycare if kids are sick and it's not, you know, really, really serious.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2763" target="_blank">00:46:03.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Then a paid caregiver can stay with them. So that will just reduce the number of sick days that you two have to take.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2771" target="_blank">00:46:11.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And if the kids are getting sick less often, then that helps with some of the sleep at night as well, because you don't have the kids who are awake because they are sick at night.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2780" target="_blank">00:46:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you have another adult who has the ability to do things around your house, whether that is, you know, you're getting your groceries delivered and that puts them away or they throw a load of laundry into the washer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2791" target="_blank">00:46:31.640</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, there's just things that they can take care of that might make life a little bit easier for you guys.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2796" target="_blank">00:46:36.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, I thought maybe that's something to consider as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2800" target="_blank">00:46:40.280</a></span> | <span class="t">If you do think that both of you will be sort of working and building your careers for a long term, it might be worth investing in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=2806" target="_blank">00:46:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">What do you think?

OK, so deep life. I use this phrase on my podcast a lot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=4024" target="_blank">01:07:04.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Being intentional about the different aspects of your life. So I guess she's she's wondering about how do you do that with kids?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=4032" target="_blank">01:07:12.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, how close is this range to yours, by the way? You have this four kids or five like four years, three, three years ago, roughly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=4039" target="_blank">01:07:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Your oldest is 16.

That's how it works. Right. Your oldest just watches all the other kids.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=4050" target="_blank">01:07:30.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's that's how that works. Isn't that how it works? Well, he can. He can. And he does some.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=4056" target="_blank">01:07:36.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But I try not to hit my kids up for too much babysitting when they have other things that they would like to be doing with their time, like studying and such.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=4066" target="_blank">01:07:46.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, it's a lot of kids. There's a lot of kids when you have five of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=4073" target="_blank">01:07:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I totally love this question, though, because she's correct that time with children often does feel very reactive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=4080" target="_blank">01:08:00.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And even if you do have routines, it can feel very unstructured at times. And in many cases, it doesn't feel particularly enjoyable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=4089" target="_blank">01:08:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And clearly she's chosen to work part time because she wants to spend more time with her kids.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=4094" target="_blank">01:08:14.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And yet it can feel like that's not the good part of the day, because, I mean, partly the kids have their own things going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=4102" target="_blank">01:08:22.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, five kids can be pretty chaotic. But I think approaching this with some amount of intentionality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=4109" target="_blank">01:08:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And this goes for anyone. And sort of those hours after work and before bed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=4112" target="_blank">01:08:32.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I feel like these are the hardest hours to use well in our lives, because we're tired. We're all there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=4119" target="_blank">01:08:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">We all need to get through to the end of the day. And it could be a really cool time. But in many cases, it just isn't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=4127" target="_blank">01:08:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But being somewhat intentional about it, like saying, you know, what is some little adventure we could have today?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=4135" target="_blank">01:08:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, what would I like to have done with a kid or some number of kids by the end of the day?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=4141" target="_blank">01:09:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And it can be simple.

It's like, well, you're working a very, very long hour job.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=4286" target="_blank">01:11:26.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And it sounds like perhaps your partner is, too.

I mean, but yeah, if he's working late every night, I would I would certainly say you might want to bring in a little bit of reinforcements to help you with this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=4323" target="_blank">01:12:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And if he has the option of not doing that again, we do the thing where each partner gets one night off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=4327" target="_blank">01:12:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Do that more clearly. Yeah. Tuesday, like he's home at five and you go off and do your thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=4331" target="_blank">01:12:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, you know, obviously what you're on till eight the other nights anyway. So he can he can do his thing if he wants to as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=4337" target="_blank">01:12:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.

Let's do one more question. We've got time for one more question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=4479" target="_blank">01:14:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">This is from Tim, a 26 year old from Australia. Tim says, in the past, I've definitely had a problem with over committing and piling on more stuff at the expense of some of my visions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=4489" target="_blank">01:14:49.680</a></span> | <span class="t">particularly around athletic leisure and focus time with loved ones.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=4493" target="_blank">01:14:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">A lot of this has seemingly stemmed from a lack of overarching vision for my life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=4497" target="_blank">01:14:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">How do I escape this pattern? So I talk a lot about this on the show about workload and over committing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=4503" target="_blank">01:15:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So what I'm interested in is how you think about how you think about keeping the load of things on your plate manageable and preventing it from creeping into something that becomes a source of issues.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=4515" target="_blank">01:15:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, well, I mean, one of the most important habits I have for managing my life is I plan my upcoming weeks, usually on Fridays, and I look at what is coming up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=4526" target="_blank">01:15:26.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I figure out what I want to do over the next week, both professionally and personally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=4531" target="_blank">01:15:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Like if I'm working toward any big goals, what steps would I like to take in the next week to get there?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=4535" target="_blank">01:15:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I look at what is already there that I've committed to that I'm going to need to do and figure out time for that and sort of triage any issues that are going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=4544" target="_blank">01:15:44.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And inevitably, what happens when I plan out the week on Friday, I may have thought looking at my calendar like, oh, it's a light week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=4550" target="_blank">01:15:50.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Like there's not that much going on. But when I actually sit down and figure out what needs to happen over the next seven days, it doesn't look that light anymore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=4558" target="_blank">01:15:58.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And that right there can make me say like, OK, we are we are at capacity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=4563" target="_blank">01:16:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So anything that isn't just an amazing opportunity, it's either a no or it's call me back in a month.

You are assigned a coach. That coach works with you to develop your plan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=5214" target="_blank">01:26:54.680</a></span> | <span class="t">What do you do with food? What do you do with exercise?

You got an injury. We need to change how you're exercising.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=5236" target="_blank">01:27:16.680</a></span> | <span class="t">They'll help you do it.

You're worried about nutrition.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=5242" target="_blank">01:27:22.680</a></span> | <span class="t">They will help you adjust your plan for that. So it's by having someone you're working with every day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=5247" target="_blank">01:27:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">That's where the results come from. So this is why I think my body tutor has been around so long, because it is a really smart idea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQGGzZihhyk&t=5255" target="_blank">01:27:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">It really does work.
