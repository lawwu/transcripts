So typically your retirement doesn't count. So anything that's a pension, profit sharing, 401ks, IRAs, all that stuff is not counted against you. For the federal method, the FAFSA, your primary residence doesn't count.</p><p>So your home, your home equity, your big mortgage, all that stuff just doesn't show up. So what does show up? Well, anything that's not retirement. So your savings, mutual funds, exotic investments, crypto, something like that. That's all, those are all assets. You'd have to report those. Stock options at work that are not tied into an actual retirement plan would count.</p><p>Real estate, that's not your primary residence. So if you have vacation land or property, if you have business property, farms, some of those things would count. And then the other big one is college savings. So your 529s would count and those types of things.</p></div></div></body></html>
