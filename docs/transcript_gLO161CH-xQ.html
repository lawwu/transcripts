That is that transition where you start to see, Oh, wait a minute, I am actually doing better.</p><p>And I feel better. But that's not the actual endpoint of learning or skill or confidence. That third phase, when you're consciously competent, you are better at this skill, but it still requires a lot of energy and focus and attention. Maybe you're getting a little bit more skilled at using more than one rewards credit card and really deliberately and strategically picking, which is the one I'm going to use for any given expense, because I know it's going to give me the highest bonus points earning for this activity, or maybe you're starting to learn how to do stacking, right?</p><p>So you already feel really confident with which credit cards you're using. But now you also want to say, how can I optimize and maximize my points are even earning even more, maybe I'm also going to utilize an online shopping</p></div></div></body></html>
