Part of that grant was getting a board seat for Open Philanthropy for a few years that we could help with their governance at a crucial early time in their development. I think some people believe that OpenAI has been net negative for the world because of the fact that they have contributed a lot to AI advancing and to AI being hyped.</p><p>And they think that gives us less time to prepare for it. And I do think that all else equal, AI advancing faster gives us less time to prepare and is a bad thing. I don't think it's the only consideration. I think OpenAI has done a number of good things too, has set some important precedents.</p><p>I think it's probably much more interested in a lot of the issues I'm talking about and risks from advanced AI than the company that I would guess would exist if they didn't that would be doing similar things. I don't really accept that even the idea that OpenAI is a negative force.</p><p>I think it's highly debatable. If you look at our specific grant, that's even a completely different thing because a lot of that was not just about boosting them, but was about getting to be part of of their early decision making.</p></div></div></body></html>
