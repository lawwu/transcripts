Hey, can you introduce yourself? Yes, sure. My name is Kenechukwu Onwe, but Kene for short. Originally from Nigeria, but currently a student at the seminary, Master's Seminary. All right, and you've been using the LSB. What do you think? The LSB has become a gem, actually. I was considering getting one last year.</p><p>I ended up being gifted one, and it's been good. It's become my primary preaching Bible, and I got to say my favorite thing about it is not only having enough margin, but I decide to scribble, but also I love that the references are in caps, because then I know that this is pulled from somewhere.</p><p>The biblical author is pulled from somewhere to make the argument. So yeah, it's a helpful tool. It is very helpful. All right, great. Thanks for stopping by. Thank you. That's perfect.</p></div></div></body></html>
