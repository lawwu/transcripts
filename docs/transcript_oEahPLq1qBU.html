And then you're protected on the outside. We have military things, et cetera. If those walls are breached by dictatorship or by really stupid grand strategy, like our country's come perilously close in the last few years, perilously close.</p><p>If Trump had been president at the time Ukraine was invaded, Ukraine would be no more. We would have Russian armies right up to the Polish border now. I gave the Marshall Lecture. It was published in the Journal of Military History. And in it, I summarized my views on what the difference between a continental and maritime power.</p><p>And that's one of my big career takeaways. It's a fundamentally different way of looking at the world. So Putin honestly looks at the world. If I control territory, that's what makes me secure. Maritime powers, they start with Britain, which is, hey, I'm secure if I can maximize money from commerce, because then I can buy Navy and buy allies with armies and stuff.</p><p>And then eventually, this order of organizing trade by international law, and the Dutch Republic is instrumental in this with Hugo Grotius, who is the founding father of international law. They want to run transactions by law, et cetera. This is an international order that's win-win. You join it. You get security.</p><p>You have input on how it evolves, because it's a work in progress. Whereas this continental thing is negative sum. And you can see it in Ukraine. So Putin wants more territory. OK, he's got a zone. He took the eastern Ukraine, and he took Crimea in 2014. But it's negative sum, because he destroys whatever businesses have been being run in Donbass, and he absolutely kills most of the tourist industry.</p><p>If you look at Europe as a peninsula, you're better off with more insulation from Russia than not. And Europeans, as a group, understand that it is absolutely in their interest to have an impregnable border around Ukraine. It protects them all. And isn't it fascinating that the Finns and the Swedes, who forever were neutral, are now all over this?</p><p>Europe doesn't threaten Russia. They would love it if Russia would join the party. Join the rules-based order. You'll make money. You'll do well. Except the oligarchs in question, this real minority of people who run Russia and Putin, they personally won't do as well. They could join the maritime order any day.</p><p>That is what, at the end of the Cold War, everyone wanted them to do. Everyone wanted Putin to join it. The Russians-- if you think about all the money Putin has spent on his crazy military stuff, imagine what would have happened if he'd spent all that on the Russian road system, because their road system's deplorable.</p><p>And imagine if he had devoted his attention to trying to have a better legal system so that people could start small businesses, get bigger, without having someone then come in on them for protection money. Think where Russia would be now. It would be dramatically better. There's so much energy, so many raw resources.</p><p>Oh, and they have so many talented people. But the Russians don't see it that way. They see it in this continental view. And they're the ones who have to come to terms with what they think. In the meantime, this is why containment's brilliant, is in the meantime, those of us who join the maritime order need to work with each other.</p><p>And then we contain the problem by saying, you cannot join us on equal footing till you behave yourselves. You get a time out, right? If you get a time out from the global order, but we would welcome you back in. So you're talking about people doing territorial conquest, right, and taking things.</p><p>You're butchering a lot of people. You're destroying wealth at an incredibly rapid clip. You can do that. But it's really wealth destroying. Since the Industrial Revolution in the West, there has been a growing consensus that that's probably not the way to do things. We are far better crafting international institutions, international laws, treaties that we sign onto, the parts that we want to, and then we adhere to them.</p><p>And then that allows us to go all over the world running our little credit card transactions. No one kills us, and you can make a lot of wealth doing that. And that was the conclusion, that if you look at since the Industrial Revolution, who's making all the money? People who buy into that system.</p><p>And the Hitler territorial expansion is, in a way, it's a real throwback to a pre-Industrial Revolution, way of managing your national security. This is how traditional continental empires always did it. The Industrial Revolution with economic growth, compounding economic growth, offers a completely different alternative, which says we're going to do compounding wealth by having rules that we can all adhere to, and then we'll run our commercial transactions that way.</p><p>Institutions are really important. Institutions structure decision making. Now, it's very difficult to figure out what types of institutions to build. And when you see failings in them, you go, oh, I've got to do something next time. But this, again, is the brilliance of this evolving maritime order in which we live, where people sign on to the things in which it's in their interest to sign on to them.</p><p>You sign on to treaties, and then you have provisos of the parts you don't want. And you join these international organizations, and then you influence how they develop, et cetera. So these organizations have been instrumental, the ones built right after World War II and holding the peace. That's my biggest career takeaway, is that if we go through international law and international institutions-- and this is not a hege-- political scientists love to talk about, ah, America, the hegemon, right?</p><p>No other country in the world wants an American hegemon. There may be some people in the United States who thinks that looks great, but no one's going to buy into a world order in which the United States is the hegemon who pushes everyone else around. I get it. We're big, and we're influential.</p><p>Other people are influential, too. But this maritime order, where, yeah, we're an important part of it, but have many other people in it, it's a win-win. And you can look at some-- with Biden right now, he's doing all of these meetings with Europeans of managing of what's going to go on in Ukraine, et cetera.</p><p>And it's based on agreement of all these different countries chipping in, big and small, those countries that are willing to cooperate with each other, not invade, negotiate their disagreements, work through international organizations, improve international organizations. That world is what you want to protect. And you want to allow people to come and join.</p><p>So if Russia changes its mind, new government, et cetera, you want to bring them back into-- just the way Japan and Germany were brought back in. You want to protect that order forever. Our prosperity is based on it.</p></div></div></body></html>
