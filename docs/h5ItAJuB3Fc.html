My name is Diego Rodriguez. I'm the co-founder of CREA, a startup</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=21" target="_blank">00:00:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">in the AI space like many others, in particular generative media, multimedia, multimodal, and all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=27" target="_blank">00:00:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">the buzzwords. But I come here mainly to tell a story about how we think about evaluations when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=40" target="_blank">00:00:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">we have to take into account human perception and human opinion and aesthetics into the mix, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=48" target="_blank">00:00:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm going to start with a very simple story. It's like I put an AI-generated image of a hand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=54" target="_blank">00:00:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Obviously, it looks horrible. And then I ask O3, what do you think of this image? Then he thought</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=60" target="_blank">00:01:00.240</a></span> | <span class="t">for 17 seconds, obviously, tool calling, does Python, analysis, OpenCV, goes crazy. And then after he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=66" target="_blank">00:01:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">charges me a few cents, it's like, oh, just a couple of months, it's like, it's mostly natural, but like...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=72" target="_blank">00:01:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's like, okay, we have like what many people claim is basically AGI, and it is completely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=80" target="_blank">00:01:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">unable of answering a very simple question. And like, that's a surprising thing if you think about it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">because we as humans, when people see that image, it's like we just react so naturally, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=96" target="_blank">00:01:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Against that, it's like, ugh, what is that? Like, that's not natural. And I feel like that's precisely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=101" target="_blank">00:01:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">what AI models are being trained on. A, on human data, right? Second, human preference data. And third,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=111" target="_blank">00:01:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">like, in a way limited by the data that we humans made based on our preconceived notions and perception</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and all of that. So that's what this talk is about, about what can we do better? And honestly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=129" target="_blank">00:02:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">to ask ourselves some questions that I think are not being asked enough in the field.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Cool. So tiny, tiny bit of history. There's a... We all know about Claude, or Claude Shannon, that is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the father of information theory. And according to many, his master's thesis is one of the most</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">important master's thesis in the world, where he laid foundations for digital circuits, and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">eventually communication and all. And to a degree, we can say that even LLMs nowadays, right? If we fast forward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And I want to focus on the fact that we call his work foundational and information theory, well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.120</a></span> | <span class="t">when he published it, it was actually called, like, mathematical foundation for communication theory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And he was always focused on communication. There's this image appears on that work, and it's all about,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">okay, this is the source, this is the channel, this is nation, there can be some noise there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And as a founder of a company that is focusing on media, to me, it's interesting to realize, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">these parallels between classic information theory and communication. Let me see, did I put the image?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's see. Well, if you, I didn't put the image, but if you have any context around variational</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.120</a></span> | <span class="t">autoencoders or neural networks and whatever, you can screen and be like, oh, is that a neural network?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? And in the context of information and communication, I want to talk about how compression is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">going to be related to how we think about evaluation, right? And I'm going to talk, for example, on JPEG.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">JPEG exploits, like, human nature in the sense that we are very sensitive to brightness, but not so much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">to color. And this is an illusion that also talks about that, where A and B is actually the same color,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">but we are basically unable to perceive it until we do this. And then, suddenly, it's like, oh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">really? And it's kind of like, what's going on there? Right? And so, JPEG just does the same thing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">where, okay, we have RGB color space to represent images with computers. We notice that there's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">diagonal that represents the brightness of the images. We can change into a different color space</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that separates color versus brightness. And then, we can downsample the channels around color,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">because we are actually not even down sensitive to it. So, we can remove that or parts of it. And then,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">once we do that, this is an image where we can see the brightness and color components separated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Once we downsample, we can try to recreate the image. And this is an example of, like, basically,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">original image and then the image with the downsample color looks the same to us. And the image is, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">50% less information. Right? And other stuff. There's Huffman coding and more stuff. But, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=333" target="_blank">00:05:33.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the point is the same. Right? And then, the thing is, if you exploit the same for audio, like, what can we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">hear? What can we not hear? Well, you do the same and we have MP3. And then, if you do the exact same</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=347" target="_blank">00:05:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">thing across time, well, congrats, now you have MP4. It's, like, it's all this principle of, like, let's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=353" target="_blank">00:05:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">exploit how we humans perceive the world. Right? But this made me think about myself because I studied</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">artificial systems engineering, which is engineering around all of these, how microphones work, how speakers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=367" target="_blank">00:06:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">work? And it was just interesting to me that I was coding. I start deleting information. I know for a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=375" target="_blank">00:06:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">fact that I'm deleting information, yet, and then I re-render the image, and I see the same. It's, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">like, philosophers always tell you about, like, oh, we are limited by our senses. But, like, this is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=386" target="_blank">00:06:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">first time that I was, like, I'm seeing it. Right? Like, I am not seeing the difference. Um, but then,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=393" target="_blank">00:06:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">if all, if, if a lot of our data is the internet, right? Like, we're stripping data from the internet,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=402" target="_blank">00:06:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">bunch of those images are also compressed, right? Like, are we taking into account that perhaps our AIs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=407" target="_blank">00:06:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">are limited to? Because we're, like, like, we have some sort of contagion going on of our flaws into the AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=417" target="_blank">00:06:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and then it gets more tricky because, for instance, uh, this is a, just a screenshot I took</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=425" target="_blank">00:07:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">from a paper. I think it's called Clean FID. And FID scores, for all of you who don't have context, is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=433" target="_blank">00:07:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">one of the standard metrics used for, uh, how well, for instance, diffusion models are reproducing an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=439" target="_blank">00:07:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">image. But then you start adding JPEG artifacts, and the score is, like, oh, no, no, no, this is horrible,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=443" target="_blank">00:07:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">horrible image. And it's, like, perceptually, the four images are basically the same. Yet, the FID</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=450" target="_blank">00:07:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">score is, like, no, no, no, this is really bad. So then it's, like, why are we using FID scores or metrics</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=456" target="_blank">00:07:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">along those lines to decide, oh, this generative AI model is good or bad, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=462" target="_blank">00:07:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so the thing is, sometimes I feel like we are focused on measuring just things that are easy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=469" target="_blank">00:07:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">to measure, right? Like, from adherence with clip, how many objects are there? Is this blue? Is this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=476" target="_blank">00:07:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">red? Et cetera.

It's like, no, we should use Kubernetes. And it's like, it's just all fighting and whatever,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=667" target="_blank">00:11:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and nothing gets built. And I'm like, dude, God is winning. God damn it. But then this makes me think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=675" target="_blank">00:11:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">about, like, we are now in, we just entered the age where you can have models. Essentially, they solve</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=686" target="_blank">00:11:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">translation, right? Or they solve it to a very high degree. So what happens now that we can all speak</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=695" target="_blank">00:11:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">our own languages, yet at the same time communicate with each other? I'm already doing it. For instance,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=700" target="_blank">00:11:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I do sometimes customer support manually for Korea, and I literally speak Japanese with some of my users,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=707" target="_blank">00:11:47.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and I don't speak Japanese. I learn a little bit, but I don't speak it. And I'm now able to provide an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=713" target="_blank">00:11:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">excellent founder-led, whatever that means, customer support level to a country that otherwise I would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=721" target="_blank">00:12:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">be unable to do, right? And so I invite us all to think about what that really means. Because this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=736" target="_blank">00:12:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">for instance, means that we can now understand better or transmit our own opinion better to others.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=744" target="_blank">00:12:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And on the previous point that I was talking about with the art, that's kind of like an opinion, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=751" target="_blank">00:12:31.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Like evolves are not just about are there four cats here. It's about this cat is blue. And it's like, yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=758" target="_blank">00:12:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">but is it blue or is it teal? What kind of blue? And I don't like this blue and all of that. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=766" target="_blank">00:12:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">like in a nutshell, it's like, how do we evolve our evals, right? Like from my opinion, like from my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=774" target="_blank">00:12:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">opinion, this is bad. Then I want metrics that take into account my opinion too. And then it's like, okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=782" target="_blank">00:13:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">consider myself I may be a visual learner. What that means is like, maybe your evals should take into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=792" target="_blank">00:13:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">account how we humans perceive images, right? And also the nature of the data, such as, oh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=801" target="_blank">00:13:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">it's all trained on JPEG on the internet. So take into account the artifacts, take into account,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=807" target="_blank">00:13:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, like all of these while, while training your data.

I guess mandatory slide before the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=815" target="_blank">00:13:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">thank you.

There's many points there. Can you, like, reframe the question? Like...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=878" target="_blank">00:14:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Like, like, okay, you, I showed an example of FID score. It changes a lot with JPEG artifacts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=924" target="_blank">00:15:24.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Are those where it's almost like the opposite, barely changes, uh, and the metric is still good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=929" target="_blank">00:15:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, there are some, and many of these are used also in traditional, uh, encoding, uh, techniques. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=937" target="_blank">00:15:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">But in a way I'm here to invite us all to start thinking about those, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=943" target="_blank">00:15:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">like to, we can actually train, like, we can train, uh, I mean, it's, it's called a classifier, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=956" target="_blank">00:15:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Or, or, or a continuous classifier. We can train so that it understands what we mean. And it's like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=961" target="_blank">00:16:01.440</a></span> | <span class="t">hey, I showed you these five images. These five images are actually all good. And then they can have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5ItAJuB3Fc&t=965" target="_blank">00:16:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">all sorts of artifacts, not just JPEG artifacts.
