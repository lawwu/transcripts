Enter Phil DeMuth, who, out of coincidence, just happened to have written a new</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.160</a></span> | <span class="t">book, The Tax Smart Donor, Optimize Your Lifelong Giving Plan. He sent me a copy of this book. I've read</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.660</a></span> | <span class="t">it. I was so impressed. There was so much in that book that I did not know. The strategies that Phil put</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.100</a></span> | <span class="t">forth, I thought were very insightful.

So with no</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.820</a></span> | <span class="t">further ado, let's welcome back to Bogle Heads on Investing, Phil DeMuth. Welcome back, Phil.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Rick, thank you so much for having me. It's a privilege to be here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, thank you. And it's such a timely book because last month we had a podcast talking about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the Jonathan Clemens Getting Going on Savings Initiative. And so your book, The Tax Smart Donor,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.020</a></span> | <span class="t">is actually the flip side of that, which is, yes, we want to do good, but we also maybe want to get a tax</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.540</a></span> | <span class="t">break. Now, I have to say, I thought I knew about the tax benefits of giving to charity. After reading</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">your book, I have to say, I didn't really know very much. All of the different points that you brought</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.360</a></span> | <span class="t">out were fantastic in the book, and we're going to go through the book. But first, why did you decide</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.220</a></span> | <span class="t">to write the book? My father died about 30 years ago. While he was a patriotic American, fought in World</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">War II, he did not like paying taxes that he didn't have to pay. And he had enough money at the time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.540</a></span> | <span class="t">that he sort of eclipsed over into estate tax territory. So he ended up giving it to charity</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">instead. So that was really my first introduction to charitable giving on more than a $5 bill in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.120</a></span> | <span class="t">church collection plate level. Over time, I came to learn more. I live in the state of California,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.020</a></span> | <span class="t">California, which some of you may know is a high tax state. The taxes get very expensive here. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">this may be very tax sensitive and looking for any angle I could to try to save money.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So the book talks about saving on taxes on many different levels of federal income tax, federal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.200</a></span> | <span class="t">estate tax. And some states, state income tax, state estate tax, and state inheritance tax,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.440</a></span> | <span class="t">potentially five different taxes. Yes. And before we get on that path, let's start at the beginning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">with a history of the charitable contribution tax deduction. Yes, it's one of the oldest sacred cows</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.180</a></span> | <span class="t">in the tax code going back to 1916, just a few years after the income tax itself began. It started</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=329" target="_blank">00:05:29.820</a></span> | <span class="t">basically because President Wilson wanted to raise taxes to allow the U.S. to participate in World War</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.500</a></span> | <span class="t">War 1. Turned out to be a fairly calamitous decision. He rose taxes from 15% to 67%. And at that point,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">it became an open question for the wealthy people in America. Why should we give all our money to these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.180</a></span> | <span class="t">various civic institutions, you know, concert halls and libraries and education institutions and so forth?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">If the government's taking two thirds of our money, why don't we let them pick up the tab? Then we'll just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=375" target="_blank">00:06:15.500</a></span> | <span class="t">spend the money on the stuff that we want to spend money on. And so Congress quickly realized this was not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.980</a></span> | <span class="t">going to work. They wanted to spend on their own schemes. So they thought we better have the rich people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=387" target="_blank">00:06:27.900</a></span> | <span class="t">paying this. So we're going to give them a tax break. They can deduct the money from their income tax. That way,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.140</a></span> | <span class="t">they'll take care of all the stuff that we don't want to bother with. So it's stayed in place ever since.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=399" target="_blank">00:06:39.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So that begs the question, what is a charity?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.260</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a concept that's nowhere defined.

But there is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.660</a></span> | <span class="t">practical definition, which is that if you're thinking about giving to charity and have any interested in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=429" target="_blank">00:07:09.660</a></span> | <span class="t">getting a tax deduction, it better be for the most part, a 501c3 public charity.

off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=1575" target="_blank">00:26:15.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you're married, you can give $300 that used to be in the tax code a few years ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=1581" target="_blank">00:26:21.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think it sunset like two years ago, if I'm not mistaken.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=1585" target="_blank">00:26:25.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=1585" target="_blank">00:26:25.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=1586" target="_blank">00:26:26.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And under COVID, they thought they would give Americans a chance to do something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=1590" target="_blank">00:26:30.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're going to get into some things like bunching a little bit later on and where you could still finagle your giving to a donor advised fund to be able to take a tax deduction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=1599" target="_blank">00:26:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But we'll talk about that in a little bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=1601" target="_blank">00:26:41.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to get into another tax.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=1604" target="_blank">00:26:44.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is where charitable giving helps reduce that tax.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=1610" target="_blank">00:26:50.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And this tax is the estate tax, not only federal estate tax, but state estate taxes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=1617" target="_blank">00:26:57.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So first, how does this work into charitable giving?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=1621" target="_blank">00:27:01.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, the estate tax is a big deal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=1624" target="_blank">00:27:04.020</a></span> | <span class="t">It's 40 percent when you cross that threshold, which I think is roughly $14 million per person, $28 million for a married couple this year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=1635" target="_blank">00:27:15.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So for people that have estates that are larger than that, 40 percent of that money is just going to the big landfill in Washington, D.C.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=1645" target="_blank">00:27:25.660</a></span> | <span class="t">People that are in that situation are meeting with their estate attorneys and trying to figure out ways around it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=1653" target="_blank">00:27:33.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so and one of the one of the big ways around that is to give money to charity in your estate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=1659" target="_blank">00:27:39.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. So let's say your estate was $60 million and you had a $28 million federal estate tax exemption for a couple.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=1670" target="_blank">00:27:50.660</a></span> | <span class="t">The other $32 million would be taxed at 40 percent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=1675" target="_blank">00:27:55.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So the estate would pay almost $13 million in estate taxes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=1680" target="_blank">00:28:00.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Of that $32 million, if you gave a portion to charity, then it comes out of the estate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=1689" target="_blank">00:28:09.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=1689" target="_blank">00:28:09.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And the estate does not have to pay the tax on that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=1693" target="_blank">00:28:13.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Is that how it works?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=1694" target="_blank">00:28:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, indeed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=1695" target="_blank">00:28:15.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Typically, as great as that is, and it's great for the charities, to be sure, for the most part, if you find yourself doing that, you have to ask yourself the question,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=1705" target="_blank">00:28:25.720</a></span> | <span class="t">would I have been better off giving more of this money away sooner, giving it away while I was alive?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=1713" target="_blank">00:28:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Because while it's great to give it to your estate and avoid the estate tax, you're not getting any income tax benefit from that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=1721" target="_blank">00:28:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Whereas if you'd given that money away while you were living, you might have been able to deduct that against your income tax and carry that forward for a number of years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=1730" target="_blank">00:28:50.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And then that money is still out of your estate, and furthermore, it's not compounding within your estate to just get bigger and bigger, to just have a bigger and bigger tax attached to it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=1740" target="_blank">00:29:00.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's a lot to be said for giving money away earlier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=1744" target="_blank">00:29:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Give while you live, as they say.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=1747" target="_blank">00:29:07.780</a></span> | <span class="t">If you give more than you're allowed to charity in a given year, like you give 100% of your income to charity in a given year, you can't take the full tax deduction on it, but it carries forward, correct?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=1765" target="_blank">00:29:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div

that it carries forward, it still has to cross the same threshold.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=1774"

target="_blank">00:30:16.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So the tax benefit is circumscribed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=1819" target="_blank">00:30:19.320</a></span> | <span class="t">That's interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=1821"

class="t">Well, to make it even more complicated, if you happen to be in 12 states plus the District of Columbia that imposes an estate tax at the state level, or six of the states that imposes an inheritance tax, which is different than the estate tax, then it's even higher.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=1865" target="_blank">00:31:05.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So first of all, what's the difference between a state tax and a state inheritance tax?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=1877" target="_blank">00:31:17.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=1877" target="_blank">00:31:17.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So you have to watch two things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=1881" target="_blank">00:31:21.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And especially if you're thinking of retiring, find a state that doesn't charge an estate tax on your net worth when you pass on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=1890" target="_blank">00:31:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Because sometimes the thresholds on these are different, they don't necessarily follow the federal model, you know, the state's tax could be considerably lower.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=1900" target="_blank">00:31:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">But also you have to watch where your beneficiaries live, because if they live in a state that has an inheritance tax, a local state could come after them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=1909" target="_blank">00:31:49.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So and you could get both.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=1911" target="_blank">00:31:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">If you live in a state that has a state tax on your inheritance, you could pay that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=1917" target="_blank">00:31:57.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And if your beneficiaries live in another state that has a state inheritance tax, they could also have to pay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=1925" target="_blank">00:32:05.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So you've got to watch out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=1926" target="_blank">00:32:06.900</a></span> | <span class="t">These six states that have an inheritance tax, one of them, Maryland, has both an estate tax and an inheritance tax.</span></div><div

target="_blank">00:32:33.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there's the state estate tax for money that's inherited in an IRA.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=1959" target="_blank">00:32:39.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there's the inheritance tax that the beneficiary gets that they have to pay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=1965" target="_blank">00:32:45.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And then when they withdraw the money from the IRA, they have to pay federal income tax and state income tax on that money.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=1973"

required minimum distribution, meaning you're 70 and a half this year, then it's $108,000 is the limit on the amount that you could give out of the IRA every year.</span></div><div class="c"><span

$100,000 out of your IRA, it doesn't carry forward that second $50,000.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=2201" target="_blank">00:36:41.480</a></span> | <span class="t">It only takes care of the $50,000 of your RMD, and the other $50,000 is just another contribution.</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=2281" target="_blank">00:38:01.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And I want to explore the strategy of bunching contributions.</span></div><div

target="_blank">00:38:12.820</a></span> | <span class="t">But every year we give to charity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=2295" target="_blank">00:38:15.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So talk about bunching.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=2296" target="_blank">00:38:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So bunching is an attempt to solve this very problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=2302" target="_blank">00:38:22.020</a></span> | <span class="t">How do we get over the standard deduction of threshold so we can get a charitable

are certain kinds of certain maneuvers you can make.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=2314" target="_blank">00:38:34.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Instead of giving every year, you could try to compress a lot of the things you do into a one year every other year slot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=2327" target="_blank">00:38:47.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So you could pay your January mortgage payment of the following year in December.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=2337" target="_blank">00:38:57.240</a></span> | <span class="t">You might be able to pay your property tax bill early and also bring that into the current year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=2343" target="_blank">00:39:03.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And then also you can supplement this by doing the bulk of your charitable giving and trying to put that into one year as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=2351" target="_blank">00:39:11.720</a></span> | <span class="t">The idea is to compress as much giving as possible into one year so that pushes you over the hurdle of the standard deduction threshold.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=2361" target="_blank">00:39:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then if you use a donor advised fund as the recipient charity, you can then make your distributions from that fund or advise on those distributions and spread them out over two years rather than one year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=2374" target="_blank">00:39:34.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So it allows your giving to be consistent without having to shove it all onto one end charity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=2381" target="_blank">00:39:41.480</a></span> | <span class="t">You can many charities if you want to use a donor advised fund.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=2384" target="_blank">00:39:44.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's just a way of trying to get a get a tax deduction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=2389" target="_blank">00:39:49.560</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not as good as a qualified charitable distribution from an IRA, but it's probably going to be the best you can do before you retire, especially if you're a prudent saver in a tax bill account.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=2404" target="_blank">00:40:04.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You probably will have securities that you might be able to get to charity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=2408" target="_blank">00:40:08.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And we're going to get into that right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=2410" target="_blank">00:40:10.920</a></span> | <span class="t">There's another aspect of the tax savings, and that is giving appreciated securities to a charity directly or through, say, a donor advised fund.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=2420" target="_blank">00:40:20.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And what's the benefit of giving appreciated securities, not selling the securities first, but just giving the appreciated securities?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=2428" target="_blank">00:40:28.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Sure. The last thing you'd want to do is sell the securities first, because you sell the securities and you've got to pay capital gains taxes on the gains, and then you give what's left over to charity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=2438" target="_blank">00:40:38.600</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a bad idea. But what you can do is you can donate appreciated securities directly from your brokerage account to a 501c3 charity, let them sell it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=2450" target="_blank">00:40:50.920</a></span> | <span class="t">They're charities. They don't pay taxes on this. So they get 100 cents on the dollar benefit from it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=2457" target="_blank">00:40:57.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Not the 65 cent or whatever it would be the cost to you as a private citizen selling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=2463" target="_blank">00:41:03.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So it turns out to be a double win. You get a tax deduction for the fair market value of the securities, and you avoid ever having to pay the capital gains tax that you would have had to pay if you sold those securities later on and used them for living expenses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=2479" target="_blank">00:41:19.160</a></span> | <span class="t">In your book, you spend some time talking about giving appreciated stock directly to charity while giving it to charity through a donor advised fund, and you fall very heavily on donor advised funds rather than trying to give it directly to charity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=2496" target="_blank">00:41:36.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, there are a number of steps you've got to give your 100 shares of Nvidia to the local library association, you've got to call up the charity or go online and hunt through their instructions on how they'd like to do it, who their brokerage firm is, what's the account number, what's the exact name on the account, what's their depository trust fund number.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=2522" target="_blank">00:42:02.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Then you've got to call up your brokerage or go online at your brokerage and find out what are their policies for how you donate securities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=2530" target="_blank">00:42:10.040</a></span> | <span class="t">You've got to download their forms.

artwork, where depending on the value of the asset that you give, you have to have all these different appraisals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

escalate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=2847" target="_blank">00:47:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">By the time you're giving

target="_blank">00:47:38.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And then if that's not enough, you also have to pay the IRS to do its own valuation on it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

to get into a pivot here a little bit into a couple of more different types of ways of giving, and that is with a charitable lead trust and charitable remainder trust.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=2992" target="_blank">00:49:52.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So we've got a few minutes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=2993" target="_blank">00:49:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Can you talk about these two entities, these two ways of which you give to charity?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=2999" target="_blank">00:49:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I can.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3000" target="_blank">00:50:00.040</a></span> | <span class="t">They're incredibly complicated, but they are relevant for some people, especially they're relevant for very wealthy people that they want to give to charity and also give to their families.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3012" target="_blank">00:50:12.040</a></span> | <span class="t">But basically they come down to two different kinds of trusts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3016" target="_blank">00:50:16.040</a></span> | <span class="t">One kind you might say is a charitable lead trust where you put a pot of money in the trust and the charity is able to take annual distribution from that trust for a period of time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3029" target="_blank">00:50:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And then at the end of that pre-specified time period, you get the appreciated principal back and there'll be, you know, tax advantages because the amount you gave to charity counts against the gift taxes on the money you put in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3046" target="_blank">00:50:46.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So that would be a lead trust.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3048" target="_blank">00:50:48.040</a></span> | <span class="t">The other example is just the reverse of that, where you put it in a charitable remainder trust and you or your descendants or your relatives get an annual distribution from that remainder trust, say for their lifetime.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3063" target="_blank">00:51:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And then at the very end, then the charity gets the pot of money and the appreciation and walks off with it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3070" target="_blank">00:51:10.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So these are two complicated ways of giving.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3074" target="_blank">00:51:14.040</a></span> | <span

attorneys.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3085" target="_blank">00:51:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Typically somebody that has expertise and these kinds of trusts, and it's going to be a, a little bit of an unbogelheadish transaction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3095" target="_blank">00:51:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Bogle heads like things that are simple, clear, transparent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3099" target="_blank">00:51:39.040</a></span> | <span class="t">These are complicated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3101" target="_blank">00:51:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">You're going to deal with accountants, attorneys, financial planners, and you have to do careful projections of what these things are going to cost.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3111" target="_blank">00:51:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">The costs are going to be high as opposed to a bogle head philosophy where the costs are low.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3116" target="_blank">00:51:56.040</a></span> | <span class="t">They still might be a great thing to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3119" target="_blank">00:51:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">What I notice about them is that people go into these thinking, I'm going to come out ahead in the sense that I'm going to get more money back for having given a sort of charitable donation this way than I would have otherwise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3134" target="_blank">00:52:14.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to be paid to give money to charity.</span></div><div

happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3143" target="_blank">00:52:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Many of these are going to end up with your spending more money on the charity and more money on the establishing the structure and setting it up and filing tax returns on it for 50 years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3156" target="_blank">00:52:36.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And then when you add all those up, the amount that you're going to get back is not going to be as much as you dreamed of originally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3163" target="_blank">00:52:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's why I encourage people to do a very careful upfront analysis of the whole transaction to make sure it's something you want to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3171" target="_blank">00:52:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">That said, there are cases where I think even in the average case, you can give a lot of money to charity through these vehicles fairly cheaply.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3184" target="_blank">00:53:04.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you count the money given to charity, it's having some value to you as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3190" target="_blank">00:53:10.040</a></span> | <span class="t">It can be worth doing, but you have to have what attorneys might say is a charitable intent behind it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3198" target="_blank">00:53:18.040</a></span> | <span class="t">If you have a purely selfish intent, it might work in some cases, but look at it very closely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3203" target="_blank">00:53:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So come back to something you said that you can't get something from the charity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3207" target="_blank">00:53:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like I can't donate money to your charity and you're going to take me on a cruise around the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3212"

target="_blank">00:53:34.040</a></span> | <span class="t">People hope that the charitable giving is going to somehow offset the other money that they are going to be making so that they come away net with more than they went in with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3225" target="_blank">00:53:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's what tends not to happen as much as we might wish for it to happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3230"

lately.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3237" target="_blank">00:53:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And so could you talk about what they are and how they work?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3241" target="_blank">00:54:01.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Most charitable gift annuities are vehicles that are set up by the charities themselves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3247" target="_blank">00:54:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">They will say, you'll give us a hundred thousand dollars.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

target="_blank">00:54:26.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And charities are happy to set these kinds of structures up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3269" target="_blank">00:54:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Many, many charities will have these.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

is something I've got to just rush into and do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3281" target="_blank">00:54:41.040</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:54:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I think I have a Bogle head headish skepticism of any kind of a dual purpose investment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3292" target="_blank">00:54:52.040</a></span> | <span class="t">If I want an annuity, I'll just buy an annuity from a commercial annuity provider, an insurance company.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3298" target="_blank">00:54:58.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And if I want to

target="_blank">00:55:04.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And you don't get a full tax deduction for the charitable annuity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3308" target="_blank">00:55:08.040</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a lesser amount.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3310" target="_blank">00:55:10.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Correct.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3311" target="_blank">00:55:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And in theory, the charity would have an advantage because the charity can take your, say, appreciated stock that you give and sell it and not pay any taxes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3322" target="_blank">00:55:22.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Whereas if I go to the commercial annuity provider, I've got to somehow come up with money that's going to be after tax money, either from my checking account or whatever, to pay them for the policy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3336"

target="_blank">00:55:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can gift appreciated securities, not pay the capital gain tax, but get the whole entire amount turned into a single premium immediate annuity that pays you back money as opposed to selling the stock, paying capital gain tax on the sale of the stock.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3354" target="_blank">00:55:54.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And then what's left, putting it into an annuity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3357" target="_blank">00:55:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Is there any information on how much these annuities pay or what the cost is or if there are fees to this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3365" target="_blank">00:56:05.040</a></span> | <span class="t">There's an organization, some national association of gift annuities or something that specifies what they think is a recommended payout amount.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3374" target="_blank">00:56:14.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And they think that the charity really should have a 1% annual fee for managing this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3382" target="_blank">00:56:22.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Many people think 1% annual fee,

peruse the bobblehead forums, you come to dislike the idea of a 1% annual fee on anything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3392" target="_blank">00:56:32.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's just, it's my stark prejudice here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3397" target="_blank">00:56:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to mention your website, phildemuth.com, because you have put a lot of information up there, including some tools to help figure out how you should be gifting to charity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3411" target="_blank">00:56:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">You created this simple to understand formula called gifting power.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3416" target="_blank">00:56:56.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Talk about the gifting power idea and how do people use it on your website.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3420" target="_blank">00:57:00.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So in the course of writing this book, what I was primarily interested in doing was getting people out of the idea of doing charitable giving on a planning on a year by year basis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3437" target="_blank">00:57:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I wanted to promote the idea of charitable giving as a life cycle investment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3443" target="_blank">00:57:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So just as people do retirement planning or tax planning or college planning, I want people to do charitable planning based on a lifetime approach.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3453" target="_blank">00:57:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I wrote the book to try to hound the people that write the financial planning software and to include in this kind of a module in their presentations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3462" target="_blank">00:57:42.040</a></span> | <span class="t">What this requires though, is you've got to have some way of comparing options.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3467" target="_blank">00:57:47.040</a></span> | <span class="t">If I give this year, if I give this way versus this way, which way is better?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3471" target="_blank">00:57:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Which way is more tax advantageous?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3473" target="_blank">00:57:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And secondly, the other idea is what about giving now versus then?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3480" target="_blank">00:58:00.040</a></span> | <span class="t">What about giving now versus later?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3482" target="_blank">00:58:02.040</a></span> | <span class="t">If I give later, what does the scenario look like versus giving today?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3486" target="_blank">00:58:06.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reason all of this becomes important is because the tax code is really the elephant in the room in terms of controlling the value of charitable giving.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3498" target="_blank">00:58:18.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So the giving power metric is simply a way of trying to equilibrate all of these at the trans valuation of all values.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3507" target="_blank">00:58:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And it looks at how much was the charity savings, the tax savings you got for giving the money over the total amount you gave.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3517" target="_blank">00:58:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you gave $100, but you save $20 on taxes, that would be a 20% giving power.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3526" target="_blank">00:58:46.040</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you spent $20 on taxes, there would be a negative 20% giving power.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3531" target="_blank">00:58:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So it was just a very quick and easy way of figuring out, am I better off doing it this way or not?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot75szTR7Ps&t=3537" target="_blank">00:58:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Phil, we've run out
