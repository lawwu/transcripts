And 700 years later,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=14" target="_blank">00:00:14.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Anselm said, "I believe in order that I might understand." That's profound. In a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=20" target="_blank">00:00:20.200</a></span> | <span class="t">sense, faith is the doorway into more knowing. And then 800 years later, after</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=25" target="_blank">00:00:25.420</a></span> | <span class="t">that, Karl Barth came along and seems to push this one step further, essentially</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=29" target="_blank">00:00:29.460</a></span> | <span class="t">saying, "I believe in order to understand, and I seek to understand in order to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=34" target="_blank">00:00:34.380</a></span> | <span class="t">rejoice." So for him, there's a progression, and joy is the possession of those with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=40" target="_blank">00:00:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">a knowledgeable substance to their faith.

How would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=43" target="_blank">00:00:43.780</a></span> | <span class="t">you connect this train of belief, and reason, and affection? Well, I have to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=50" target="_blank">00:00:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">admit, Tony, that I have always been a little uncomfortable with the sentence, "I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=58" target="_blank">00:00:58.500</a></span> | <span class="t">believe in order that I might understand." I admit that I have not read the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=66" target="_blank">00:01:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">extended contexts in Anselm or Augustine to know precisely how they understood</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=74" target="_blank">00:01:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">those phrases, and I probably should keep my mouth shut in any critical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=78" target="_blank">00:01:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">sense of them. But the reason for my hesitation, just given the phrase itself,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=85" target="_blank">00:01:25.020</a></span> | <span class="t">is that believing and knowing have so many different meanings and connotations,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=90" target="_blank">00:01:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">even in the Bible. Sometimes believing is described as preceding knowing, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.820</a></span> | <span class="t">sometimes, in fact, more often, I think, knowing is described as preceding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=101" target="_blank">00:01:41.280</a></span> | <span class="t">believing. A couple of examples. "Teach me good judgment and knowledge, for I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">believe in your commandments." So here, believing is the foundation of his</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.600</a></span> | <span class="t">prayer for knowledge. Or John 10:38, Jesus says, "If I do these works, even though you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.840</a></span> | <span class="t">do not believe me, believe the works that you may know and understand that the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Father is in me, and I'm in the Father." So Jesus says there's a kind of believing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=139" target="_blank">00:02:19.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that can lead into a kind of knowing. So clearly those guys are onto something,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.120</a></span> | <span class="t">right? However, more often, I think, at least in my surveys, we read things like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">this from John 16:30, "Now we know that you know all things, Jesus. This is why we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">believe that you came from God." Or Psalm 9, verse 10, "Those who know your name put</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">their trust in you." Or Proverbs 22, 19, "That your trust may be in the Lord, I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">have made them known to you this day, namely the sayings of the wise." So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">knowing is a means to trusting, a means to believing. So we know from Scripture</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">that it works both ways, depending on what you mean by believing and knowing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Knowing is the foundation for believing, in some sense, and believing takes you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.600</a></span> | <span class="t">deeper into knowing, in some sense. If somebody were to ask me or say to me,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.600</a></span> | <span class="t">"Believe in order that you might know," I would probably respond by saying, "What</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">truth do you want me to believe that I might know the truth?" So you can see the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.920</a></span> | <span class="t">problem immediately. It would be a very, I think, a very serious mistake to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">encourage people to believe in a Jesus they knew nothing about. Believing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">without content, without some knowing of information and truth, is empty mysticism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And the biggest problem with this kind of mysticism is that an unknown Christ</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.920</a></span> | <span class="t">cannot be trusted and cannot be glorified.

This is why preaching the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.040</a></span> | <span class="t">gospel precedes faith, and grasping it, knowing the meaning of what is preached,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.240</a></span> | <span class="t">precedes faith. How are they to believe in whom they have never heard? So faith</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.240</a></span> | <span class="t">comes from hearing, and hearing through the Word of Christ. And I would add, and I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.640</a></span> | <span class="t">think Paul assumes it, faith comes from hearing and understanding what you hear</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.720</a></span> | <span class="t">so that it's not gibberish. You know, it doesn't do any good to preach in Chinese,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to an English speaker, about the gospel because he can't construe it. He can't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.680</a></span> | <span class="t">know it in some sense. But it is also true that genuine faith opens the heart</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and mind to deeper and higher and wider knowing. True saving faith is humble and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.560</a></span> | <span class="t">teachable and in harmony with God and less vulnerable to Satan's deceptions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=322" target="_blank">00:05:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And so for all those reasons, and probably more that Augustine and Enzel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.560</a></span> | <span class="t">saw that I don't, for all those reasons, faith is much more able to see things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=334" target="_blank">00:05:34.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and know things about God than the proud, independent, deceived heart can know. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.380</a></span> | <span class="t">faith leads to understanding, and it wouldn't be wrong at all to say, "I have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=348" target="_blank">00:05:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">faith so that I may understand in that sense." However, now what you really were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">getting at was the joy piece. I haven't even touched it yet. When you stir joy into this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.360</a></span> | <span class="t">mix, the Bible shows—it gets really complicated and yet glorious, I think—the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Bible shows that joy is the outcome of both believing and knowing. Galatians 5:22,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=373" target="_blank">00:06:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">"Joy is the fruit of the Holy Spirit." We know that the Holy Spirit is given</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=378" target="_blank">00:06:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">through faith. Galatians 3:5, "So joy is a fruit of faith as the Holy Spirit works</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=385" target="_blank">00:06:25.080</a></span> | <span class="t">through faith." And Romans 5:3, Paul says, "We rejoice in our sufferings knowing that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=392" target="_blank">00:06:32.040</a></span> | <span class="t">suffering produces endurance." You have to know something for this joy to kick in in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the midst of suffering. And 1 Peter 1:6 says, "In this you rejoice, though now for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=404" target="_blank">00:06:44.360</a></span> | <span class="t">a little while you endure various trials." And the "this" refers back to—I count</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=408" target="_blank">00:06:48.760</a></span> | <span class="t">about ten things in verses 3 through 5—of glorious things. We're born</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=415" target="_blank">00:06:55.400</a></span> | <span class="t">again, we have a living hope, Jesus is raised from the dead, we have an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=418" target="_blank">00:06:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">inheritance that's incorruptible, we're being kept by God. And he says, "In</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.400</a></span> | <span class="t">this you rejoice," meaning you know this.

Now, Karl Barth</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=438" target="_blank">00:07:18.120</a></span> | <span class="t">is right, then, that we pursue knowing and we pursue believing, not as ends in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=443" target="_blank">00:07:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">themselves, but in order that we might go higher and deeper in our joy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=450" target="_blank">00:07:30.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I would only add two things to that.

One is that the reason God designed it that way is that God is not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=463" target="_blank">00:07:43.720</a></span> | <span class="t">glorified when all that we know about him bores us. In other words, God does</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=471" target="_blank">00:07:51.960</a></span> | <span class="t">not design the world just so that we might know things about him truly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=477" target="_blank">00:07:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">because if you know something truly and it bores you, God is not glorified in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCnvYzeanuk&t=483" target="_blank">00:08:03.080</a></span> | <span class="t">your knowing.
