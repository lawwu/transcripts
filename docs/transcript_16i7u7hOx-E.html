Obviously my faith. Also, like, I was standing up for, you know, children's sex trafficking. I mean, I've always been a big advocate on just, like, stopping it and, you know, really caring for those kids because it happens all across the world and not a lot of people talk about it.</p><p>So that's another thing. That is one of the most under-talked-about crimes. Like, there's 800,000 or some crazy stat of children that go missing a year. Where are they really going? Who's spending that money? Who is the ones keeping this under wraps? Like, it's such an under-talked-about thing, and that's for a reason.</p><p>It's a hard conversation, which I get it. It's a hard conversation. I get it. Like, it makes people... But it's reality. It's reality. It's really happening, and it's really happening to real kids, happening to real families.</p></div></div></body></html>
