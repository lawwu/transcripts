That gives you the opportunity to see the value in the business that you're invested in. You look at companies like Starbucks, for example, they will continue to reward shareholders through holding those shares over long periods of time by returning cash to shareholders.</p><p>In the form of dividends, there's compounding, right? The longer you own certain companies and that comes with dividends and also capital appreciation, stocks go up. Long-term returns, if you look at, say, the past 150 years of data, on an unlevered basis, stocks have definitely delivered the best nominal returns, 10% annual, annualized for 150 years.</p><p>You can't really get that with real estate, bonds, gold or what have you. So stocks have been kind of the winner in that specific regard.</p></div></div></body></html>
