I'm also going to unpack how membership rewards really works,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=26" target="_blank">00:00:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">including how to get the most from your points and share tips on everything from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=30" target="_blank">00:00:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">hidden credits to approval rules, to upgrade downgrade strategies, tips for retention offers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=35" target="_blank">00:00:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and a lot more.

So I got my first Amex card since 19 years old, and it's pretty easy to track</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=50" target="_blank">00:00:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">these things because they have a thing on the front of the card that says member sense, and they have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=54" target="_blank">00:00:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the date. And I've been accumulating millions of Amex points ever since. In fact, I most certainly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=59" target="_blank">00:00:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">have earned more Amex points than any other points program out there. And between my wife and I,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=64" target="_blank">00:01:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">we currently have 15 different Amex cards. Now, not all of them are the same. We might have two platinum</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=69" target="_blank">00:01:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">cards, but we have 15 different individual cards. And it's a program I've gone really, really deep on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=75" target="_blank">00:01:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so today I'm really excited to share a lot more. First, I'm going to run through all of their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.360</a></span> | <span class="t">cards. There's 31 of them. So there's a lot. I will try to be quick. I'm going to include co-brand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=83" target="_blank">00:01:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">cards like Hilton and Delta and talk about all the features and benefits, giving my opinion and ranking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=88" target="_blank">00:01:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">them on a tier list as I go. And then I'm going to dive into their points program, membership rewards,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=93" target="_blank">00:01:33.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and how to get the most out of it, how I like to use it. I'll touch on some of the exciting things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=97" target="_blank">00:01:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">available to all Amex card holders, like Amex offers, retention offers, referral offers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I'll share some of the nuances of Amex's rules for opening cards, getting bonuses,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=108" target="_blank">00:01:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and a lot more. Finally, we'll see how an Amex-only card combo stacks up against other issuers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And note that we do have links to all the Amex cards and their offers on our website,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=117" target="_blank">00:01:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">allthehacks.com/cards. The offers I'm going to talk about today and the exact amounts are good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">as of today. I'm recording on June 26, 2025. However, those links on our website, at least</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">right now are not affiliate links because it turns out Amex affiliate links don't always have the best</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">bonuses. So right now we've transitioned to start sharing referral links from our members because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=138" target="_blank">00:02:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">those referral links usually do have the best bonuses. And while we're not making money on those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">links as a business, our members are getting a bunch of bonus points, but more importantly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">those links have the best offers. So please go ahead and use them, support our members,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">or if you want to have your referral links in rotation to earn your referral bonus points,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=155" target="_blank">00:02:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">you can join the membership at allthehacks.com/join. All right. So let's start with the cards that earn</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Amex's famous currency membership rewards points. But before that, there's just a few benefits that I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">going to skip for every single card as I run through this episode, because they are consistent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">across the entire Amex portfolio. So unless I mentioned otherwise on a card, they all have extended</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">warranty protections and purchase protections. They all have no foreign transaction fees or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">authorized user fees. Again, I will point out when that's not true. And for all the co-brand cards,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the Marriott, Hilton, Delta, they have baggage insurance and secondary rental insurance. They might</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">also have some of those things with some of the premium cards. But in general, if I don't mention it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">all the co-brand cards do have that. So let's jump in to the membership rewards cards. So the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">first card we're going to talk about is the Amex green card. It earns membership reward points,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">has an annual fee of $150. Right now, the signup bonus isn't that exciting. It's 40,000 points</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">on $3,000 of spend in six months. It's been as high as 60 or 50,000 points in the past. Not a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">lot to love about the signup bonus, but I actually think it's an underrated card that doesn't get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">talked about nearly enough. It earns 3x points on travel, transit, and dining worldwide. So that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">really awesome, right? There aren't a lot of cards that are hitting all of those categories</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">at a lower annual fee, $150, and then 1x on everything else. Similar card might be the city</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">premier card where you get 3x on flights, hotels, and dining, but you're not getting it on all other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">travel. This used to be comparable to the Chase Sapphire Reserve, which now is 4x flights, 4x hotels,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">but 1x travel in other categories. So 3x travel, 3x transit, 3x dining. I like this card, even though</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the signup bonus isn't high. It's not a card a lot of people want to add to their portfolio because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">they've got those places covered. As for benefits, not a lot. $199 clear plus credit. So if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">want to sign up for clear to expedite security, you can do that and get reimbursed.

And like the other green, gold, platinum, centurion business and personal versions, it is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">charge card. Which means that at the end of the month, you pay your bill off in full. It doesn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">just automatically accrue interest unless you enroll in Amex pay over time feature, which we'll talk about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">later. So there is no set fixed limit either. Now, obviously, there is some limit. You can't just get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the card and spend $500,000 on it, but there's no specific limit that you're forced to stay under each</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">month. And so as you spend more and pay off your card more and more, you're able to spend more and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">more. Now, it seems from people I know that spend a lot with Amex that once you hit the $100,000</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">balance on all of your charge cards limit, especially on the business side, they might reach out and do a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">little bit of a financial review or want to review your business statements or tax returns just to make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=316" target="_blank">00:05:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">sure that you actually have the money to pay off these cards. As for the tier list, I'm going to put the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">green card at the A tier. It is 3x travel, 3x transit, 3x restaurants for $150. Membership rewards</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=328" target="_blank">00:05:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">points are awesome. Might not have that many awesome perks to offset the annual fee, but very few cards</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">have this much going on for them in terms of earning. So I really like it. Not an S tier card, right? And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you still got to pay the annual fee to get these perks. But especially with the fact that most of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=345" target="_blank">00:05:45.420</a></span> | <span class="t">other cards out there don't have anything in the travel category, I think it's pretty interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, on the flip side, there is a business version of this card. The business green card has a $95</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.220</a></span> | <span class="t">annual fee, earns 1x points on everything. The only elevated earning is 2x on prepaid travel booked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">through Amex's travel portal. Not exciting. 15,000 point signup bonus. Not exciting. You can sometimes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=367" target="_blank">00:06:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">find 25,000. It does come with baggage insurance as an added benefit that isn't on every Amex card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=372" target="_blank">00:06:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">But as far as I'm concerned, that's a D tier card, right? It's bottom of the barrel. You're getting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.760</a></span> | <span class="t">1x points on everything and an annual fee. So many better cards. I don't see any reason anyone should</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=382" target="_blank">00:06:22.340</a></span> | <span class="t">be holding this card. Next, we're going to talk about the Amex gold card. And that's a personal card,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=386" target="_blank">00:06:26.540</a></span> | <span class="t">earns 4x on groceries and 4x on restaurants. But the grocery spend has a $25,000 a year cap.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=393" target="_blank">00:06:33.980</a></span> | <span class="t">The restaurant side has a $50,000 a year cap. And then it earns 3x on flights, 1x on everything else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=399" target="_blank">00:06:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It does also get 2x on prepaid hotels through Amex travel. But again, I don't really like booking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=404" target="_blank">00:06:44.920</a></span> | <span class="t">hotels in the travel portal and especially not for one extra point. So I'll set that aside.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=409" target="_blank">00:06:49.620</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's a 4x grocery, 4x dining card, 3x flights. I really like this card. This card is one that I keep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=416" target="_blank">00:06:56.260</a></span> | <span class="t">in my wallet. It is my primary dining and grocery card out there. I have other cards for more points</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=421" target="_blank">00:07:01.820</a></span> | <span class="t">on flights, but I'm using this a lot. The signup bonus right now as of recording is as high as it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=428" target="_blank">00:07:08.120</a></span> | <span class="t">has ever been at 100,000 points for $6,000 of spend in six months. However, Amex has this new</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=435" target="_blank">00:07:15.080</a></span> | <span class="t">phrasing where the signup bonus is labeled as high as 100,000 points. So you might not get the full</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=441" target="_blank">00:07:21.060</a></span> | <span class="t">100,000 points. And you go through this process where you apply for the card, they tell you what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=445" target="_blank">00:07:25.540</a></span> | <span class="t">you get, your credit hasn't been hit with a hard inquiry, and then you get to decide how to go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=449" target="_blank">00:07:29.740</a></span> | <span class="t">forward. It's a real pain that you have to go through all of that to find out your bonus. So I can't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=453" target="_blank">00:07:33.700</a></span> | <span class="t">promise what your bonus will be. And I don't know if this is something Amex is going to move to for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=458" target="_blank">00:07:38.260</a></span> | <span class="t">all of their cards going forward, where they kind of look at your profile and decide whether you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=463" target="_blank">00:07:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">going to get a bonus. There also is a bunch of family language around Amex bonuses. So I'll talk</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=467" target="_blank">00:07:47.720</a></span> | <span class="t">about that a little more at the end. But at the high level, you know, generally within each group of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=472" target="_blank">00:07:52.180</a></span> | <span class="t">cards, so membership rewards cards on the personal side, you can't get the bonus for the gold if you've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=478" target="_blank">00:07:58.020</a></span> | <span class="t">already had a higher tier card. So once you have a platinum, you can't get the bonus for the gold or the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=481" target="_blank">00:08:01.940</a></span> | <span class="t">green. So if you're going to try to maximize all the bonuses, you'd want to get the green bonus,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=485" target="_blank">00:08:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">then later get the gold bonus, then later get the platinum. Because if you go in reverse,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=489" target="_blank">00:08:09.300</a></span> | <span class="t">you actually can only get the platinum bonus and none of the others. Right now at 100,000 points,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=493" target="_blank">00:08:13.700</a></span> | <span class="t">if this is a card you've been interested in, now is the time to get this card. The perks it comes with,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=497" target="_blank">00:08:17.940</a></span> | <span class="t">you get $7 a month at Dunkin' Donuts, which is a strange perk for a card like Amex to have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=504" target="_blank">00:08:24.140</a></span> | <span class="t">But you can load your Dunkin' app with the $7 each month, and then use it as like a loaded gift card</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=510" target="_blank">00:08:30.260</a></span> | <span class="t">balance later. Even though it's not marketed as such, you could use it at Baskin Robbins. So if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=514" target="_blank">00:08:34.520</a></span> | <span class="t">you ever go to Dunkin' Donuts or Baskin Robbins, you can cash it out and you don't have to do it on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=517" target="_blank">00:08:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">a monthly basis. You get $50 every six months at Resi restaurants. And similar, if you find</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=523" target="_blank">00:08:43.740</a></span> | <span class="t">restaurants that are on Resi that use the toast platform for their point of sale system, you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=527" target="_blank">00:08:47.860</a></span> | <span class="t">usually buy gift cards for those restaurants. And you can do that online and use them later. So you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=532" target="_blank">00:08:52.200</a></span> | <span class="t">can optimize if you're not going to be at a restaurant in the January to June range. But there are a ton of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=537" target="_blank">00:08:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">great restaurants on Resi. So that one's pretty easy to get use out of. There's a $10 a month credit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=542" target="_blank">00:09:02.700</a></span> | <span class="t">for dining at Grubhub, Cheesecake Factory, Goldbelly, Wine.com, and Five Guys. It's a strange mix of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=550" target="_blank">00:09:10.580</a></span> | <span class="t">venues. Grubhub for pickup seems to be the easiest one for me to get use out of. I haven't really ever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=555" target="_blank">00:09:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">used it at any of the other locations, but we do carry out at least probably once or twice a month.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=561" target="_blank">00:09:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we use the Grubhub credit and get pretty good value. Now last, there is a $10 a month Uber</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=567" target="_blank">00:09:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">credit, which gets automatically added to your Uber account. If you didn't know this, you can use one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=572" target="_blank">00:09:32.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Uber account. And if you and your partner have multiple Amexes, you can add all of those Amexes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=576" target="_blank">00:09:36.500</a></span> | <span class="t">to one account and then share that login across multiple phones and multiple people. And that way,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=581" target="_blank">00:09:41.560</a></span> | <span class="t">you can pool all that Uber credit in one place. So you are able to stack your Uber credit from multiple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=587" target="_blank">00:09:47.420</a></span> | <span class="t">golds or platinums for multiple people in one account and use it. So if you add all those up,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=591" target="_blank">00:09:51.980</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it makes up for the $250 annual fee if you're able to use it well, especially if you factor</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=597" target="_blank">00:09:57.800</a></span> | <span class="t">in that you're getting 4x on groceries, 4x on restaurants. And obviously, if you're spending</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=602" target="_blank">00:10:02.040</a></span> | <span class="t">way more than $50,000 on restaurants or $25,000 on groceries, maybe that's not as good of a deal as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=607" target="_blank">00:10:07.700</a></span> | <span class="t">it is for other people. But for me, this is my primary card that I keep in my wallet because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=612" target="_blank">00:10:12.700</a></span> | <span class="t">dining spend seems to be one of the few things that sometimes you need a physical card. So it's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=617" target="_blank">00:10:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">primary bias for why I have it in my wallet, but I use it all the time. It's an S tier card for me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=622" target="_blank">00:10:22.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And you know, I'm really happy with it. All right. So the business version of the gold card,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=626" target="_blank">00:10:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">higher annual fee at $375. You get 4x points on two categories, but it's the top two categories of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=633" target="_blank">00:10:33.500</a></span> | <span class="t">all of your spending. And that could be advertising, electronics or software, restaurants, gas, transit,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=639" target="_blank">00:10:39.380</a></span> | <span class="t">and phone. But that's only up to $150,000 a year on those two combined categories. Otherwise,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=645" target="_blank">00:10:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">it's a 1x on everything card. The signup bonus right now, if you're on the website looks like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=650" target="_blank">00:10:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">it is only 100,000 points. But on the business cards, you can actually sometimes find much better</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=656" target="_blank">00:10:56.420</a></span> | <span class="t">signup bonuses. So it's 100,000 points on 15,000 spend in the first three months. And you get a 0%</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=661" target="_blank">00:11:01.560</a></span> | <span class="t">APR for six months. So it's an intro APR. And when I say you can find better offers, sometimes if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=668" target="_blank">00:11:08.140</a></span> | <span class="t">find a referral offer, and you open that referral offer in a new browser, or you change your VPN location,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=674" target="_blank">00:11:14.200</a></span> | <span class="t">you sometimes find out that the offer isn't 100.

So I don't know what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=713" target="_blank">00:11:53.900</a></span> | <span class="t">the future holds, I'll give an update when I find out.

Getting an offer somewhere else that is 150 to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=724" target="_blank">00:12:04.340</a></span> | <span class="t">200,000 points is great. And I'll remind everyone that sometimes you get these offers in the mail</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=728" target="_blank">00:12:08.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that are targeted mailers that say, hey, we want you to sign up for this card. And if you read through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=733" target="_blank">00:12:13.580</a></span> | <span class="t">the language, the language that says you can't get this bonus if you've already had it is not in those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=738" target="_blank">00:12:18.220</a></span> | <span class="t">mailers. So we've gotten these cards multiple times. And so that's really helped us rack up a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=743" target="_blank">00:12:23.240</a></span> | <span class="t">of Amex points.

You get access to Amex's hotel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=768" target="_blank">00:12:48.900</a></span> | <span class="t">collection, you get baggage insurance, trip delay insurance and cell phone protection.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=772" target="_blank">00:12:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Overall, I think if you are spending a ton of money, but not more than $150,000 in some of those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=779" target="_blank">00:12:59.560</a></span> | <span class="t">categories, it's hard to find a business card that's going to give you 4x points. So if you spend a ton</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=784" target="_blank">00:13:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">of money on ads prior to the launch of the Chase Sapphire Reserve card for business, which has 3x</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=789" target="_blank">00:13:09.220</a></span> | <span class="t">uncapped on ads, being able to get 4x on ads, 4x on gas, 4x on restaurants for a business card or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=795" target="_blank">00:13:15.960</a></span> | <span class="t">electronics or software, which a lot of different recurring subscriptions kind of code in that camp.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=800" target="_blank">00:13:20.920</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a great card, right? I think if you're a business owner, and you spend a lot in those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=805" target="_blank">00:13:25.220</a></span> | <span class="t">categories, the Amex business gold card is an S tier card. But if you are not, then I'd move it way</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=810" target="_blank">00:13:30.860</a></span> | <span class="t">down the list. So I think it has the ability to be an incredible card, because the ability to earn a ton</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=815" target="_blank">00:13:35.940</a></span> | <span class="t">of points, the ability to take advantage if you have a lot of employees of some of the Amex employee</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=820" target="_blank">00:13:40.760</a></span> | <span class="t">offers, which I'll talk about a little later, make this a really awesome card. So I think for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=825" target="_blank">00:13:45.720</a></span> | <span class="t">that use case, it's great. If you're not someone who's going to spend a ton of money on your business</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=829" target="_blank">00:13:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">card, then this card is not that interesting. And so I would not for that person call it an S tier</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=833" target="_blank">00:13:53.160</a></span> | <span class="t">card. So let's talk about the platinum cards. There are four variations. On the personal side,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=837" target="_blank">00:13:57.740</a></span> | <span class="t">there are three and on the business side, there's one. And I think the platinum card is really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=841" target="_blank">00:14:01.800</a></span> | <span class="t">interesting because it has a lot of historical brand recognition. Oh, it's a platinum card. It's super</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=846" target="_blank">00:14:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">fancy. But from an earning potential, it's actually not that exciting. So let's talk about why you might</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=850" target="_blank">00:14:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">want it. I have one, but I would say it's primarily for the perks, not for the spend. And I'll also flag</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=856" target="_blank">00:14:16.620</a></span> | <span class="t">that after the launch of the new Chase Sapphire Reserve, Amex has come out and said this year,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=861" target="_blank">00:14:21.260</a></span> | <span class="t">they're going to refresh and update the platinum and the business platinum. So I'm gonna try to keep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=865" target="_blank">00:14:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">this quick, because if these cards are going to get completely refreshed, this is going to be a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=869" target="_blank">00:14:29.240</a></span> | <span class="t">out of date. But I at least want to give you an overview now because who knows what that refresh</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=873" target="_blank">00:14:33.260</a></span> | <span class="t">might look like. So all these cards right now have the same annual fee of $695. All right,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=878" target="_blank">00:14:38.420</a></span> | <span class="t">so the personal version of this card, the standard consumer platinum card is 5x points on flights up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=883" target="_blank">00:14:43.960</a></span> | <span class="t">to $500,000 a year, and then 5x on prepaid hotels and on Amex travel. Now that's flights can be booked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=890" target="_blank">00:14:50.100</a></span> | <span class="t">with Amex travel or can be booked directly with the airline. So you can book straight on the airline</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=893" target="_blank">00:14:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">websites. So that's a primary use case I have for this card, because it's 1x points on everything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=899" target="_blank">00:14:59.020</a></span> | <span class="t">else. So whenever I see someone using their Amex platinum, anywhere out and about other than buying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=904" target="_blank">00:15:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">flights, all I can think about is why are you spending your money like that? A couple reasons</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=907" target="_blank">00:15:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that I do like this card and why I have this card, and it's not only because I spend a ton of money on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=912" target="_blank">00:15:12.220</a></span> | <span class="t">flights. One, the signup bonuses have historically been good, but they've never been as good as they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=916" target="_blank">00:15:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">are right now. So right now you can get a signup bonus as high as 175,000 membership rewards points</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=922" target="_blank">00:15:22.120</a></span> | <span class="t">after spending $8,000 in six months. That's the highest one that's ever been out there. I've never seen a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=927" target="_blank">00:15:27.160</a></span> | <span class="t">higher bonus. I've looked historically nothing better. Obviously, it says as high as so I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=931" target="_blank">00:15:31.460</a></span> | <span class="t">know what the success rate will be for most people. But you can find out whether you're going to get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=935" target="_blank">00:15:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that 175k without having to accept it. So it's worth doing if that's interesting does have an authorized</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=941" target="_blank">00:15:41.560</a></span> | <span class="t">user fee. And we'll talk about which of the perks carry over to that. But that's $195. The big benefit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=947" target="_blank">00:15:47.060</a></span> | <span class="t">of this card is access to Amex's lounge collection. Now, one of those lounges is priority pass, which you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=952" target="_blank">00:15:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">get lots of other ways. But some of the other lounges you have access to are a lot harder to get.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=957" target="_blank">00:15:57.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So you get the Amex Centurion lounge, which you can only get with the Amex Platinum or the Amex Black</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=962" target="_blank">00:16:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">card, the Centurion card. It used to include free guests, but now you can only bring free guests if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=967" target="_blank">00:16:07.620</a></span> | <span class="t">you spend $75,000 a year on the card. You also get access to the Delta Sky Club when traveling on Delta.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=974" target="_blank">00:16:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, you don't get guests, so it's just for the primary cardholder. And then there are a couple other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=979" target="_blank">00:16:19.620</a></span> | <span class="t">lounges like the Escape lounges, which there are about 15 around the country, I think. But there's one at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=984" target="_blank">00:16:24.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the Oakland Airport that we frequent quite a bit. Lufthansa Airport lounges, Plaza Premium lounges,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=988" target="_blank">00:16:28.820</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a few edge case lounges. But the primary thing that you get here are you get access to Amex's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=993" target="_blank">00:16:33.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Centurion lounges, which is about 25 around the country, Delta Sky Clubs when flying Delta and Escape</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=998" target="_blank">00:16:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">lounges. That's a pretty big perk for someone who travels a lot and wants access to those lounges.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1002" target="_blank">00:16:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">The other big perk is that you can offset a lot of the annual fee with a lot of the credits and bonuses</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1007" target="_blank">00:16:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you get from this card. Now, some people might not like playing that game, in which case I would say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1011" target="_blank">00:16:51.540</a></span> | <span class="t">this card is definitely not for you. It's a bit of a coupon book. But you do get a $200 airline credit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1017" target="_blank">00:16:57.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So you have to select one airline for the year and you can spend up to $200 on incidentals, so not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1023" target="_blank">00:17:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">airline flights. Now, there are sometimes other things that count towards those incidentals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1027" target="_blank">00:17:07.540</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a bunch of posts on Flyer Talk if you want to go deep on what counts for each airline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1031" target="_blank">00:17:11.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's $200. You get $20 a month towards entertainment, which includes Disney+, ESPN+,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1038" target="_blank">00:17:18.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Hulu, New York Times, Peacock, and Wall Street Journal. So if you're already spending money on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1042" target="_blank">00:17:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">one of those, you could probably recoup most of that value. You get $15 a month on Uber and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1047" target="_blank">00:17:27.480</a></span> | <span class="t">$35 a month in December for $200 a year. So if you take Uber regularly, that's an easy one. Also works</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1053" target="_blank">00:17:33.700</a></span> | <span class="t">for Uber Eats. There's a $50 every six months credit to Saks Fifth Avenue, which used to be a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1060" target="_blank">00:17:40.020</a></span> | <span class="t">easier to use. And lately, we've been struggling to find anything that we want that by the time you add</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1065" target="_blank">00:17:45.920</a></span> | <span class="t">on the cost of shipping and the extreme prices of buying things from Saks, it's pretty tough to use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1071" target="_blank">00:17:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">If you have a Saks locally, sometimes you can go in and just buy a $50 gift card and maybe you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1075" target="_blank">00:17:55.620</a></span> | <span class="t">stack a few of those over time. But this has become, for me, harder and harder to use. So I probably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1080" target="_blank">00:18:00.600</a></span> | <span class="t">wouldn't value it much more for me than like $30 or $40 a year. You get $199 towards Clear+. So if you use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1088" target="_blank">00:18:08.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Clear+, that's great. You get a credit towards TSA Pre and Global Entry every four years. So if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1093" target="_blank">00:18:13.180</a></span> | <span class="t">don't have a card that has it, that's awesome. We have a ton of cards that have the TSA Pre credit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1096" target="_blank">00:18:16.980</a></span> | <span class="t">You get Hilton and Bonvoy Gold Status. You also get a $300 a year credit at Equinox. And so if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1104" target="_blank">00:18:24.260</a></span> | <span class="t">regularly use the Equinox gyms, that's great. That'll pay for maybe one month of your Equinox</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1108" target="_blank">00:18:28.920</a></span> | <span class="t">membership. However, if you don't, you can sign up for Equinox at home, which is like an online fitness</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1113" target="_blank">00:18:33.500</a></span> | <span class="t">class. If you don't use Equinox or have a friend that uses Equinox, it's really hard to get almost</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1117" target="_blank">00:18:37.540</a></span> | <span class="t">any value out of this. I would describe that value very, very low. But if you do pay for Equinox,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1122" target="_blank">00:18:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">then that's a huge value of having the Platinum card. You get Walmart Plus. You get premium status</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1127" target="_blank">00:18:47.060</a></span> | <span class="t">on a bunch of car rental programs. Now, for some reason, they stopped saying specifically which ones</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1132" target="_blank">00:18:52.260</a></span> | <span class="t">they are. But the last I look, I think you get it in Hertz, National, maybe even Avis. But you might want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1139" target="_blank">00:18:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">to look that up because for some reason they stopped marketing that. But I know on Hertz,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1143" target="_blank">00:19:03.520</a></span> | <span class="t">they have an Amex Platinum corporate code that not only gets you a discount, but the one unique feature</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1148" target="_blank">00:19:08.220</a></span> | <span class="t">is it gives you a four-hour grace period.

And there are a couple times where we've done airport rentals</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1158" target="_blank">00:19:18.280</a></span> | <span class="t">where because of our flight times, we might need to pick it up at one o'clock and drop it off at four</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1162" target="_blank">00:19:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">o'clock. And by using the Amex code, we only had to pay for one day. But any other way, we would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1167" target="_blank">00:19:27.480</a></span> | <span class="t">have had to pay for two days. Now, obviously, we didn't say we were going to drop it off at four</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1171" target="_blank">00:19:31.080</a></span> | <span class="t">o'clock. We'd rent it from one to one and drop it off three hours late. And that would be covered.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1175" target="_blank">00:19:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You also get a trip delay, cancel and interruption insurance, cell phone protection, return protection</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1181" target="_blank">00:19:41.180</a></span> | <span class="t">on purchases. And then a few other things you get access to. You get Resi's Global Dining Access,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1185" target="_blank">00:19:45.900</a></span> | <span class="t">which is supposed to give you more restaurant table availability for certain restaurants in their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1190" target="_blank">00:19:50.820</a></span> | <span class="t">special program. Haven't been able to get a lot of value there. And then there's this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1194" target="_blank">00:19:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">international airline program. Now, it used to be something where you'd get two for one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1198" target="_blank">00:19:58.760</a></span> | <span class="t">on full fare business class international flights. Now, it's just kind of discounts on international</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1204" target="_blank">00:20:04.040</a></span> | <span class="t">airfare. And those discounts are real. They're typically greater for international business and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1210" target="_blank">00:20:10.380</a></span> | <span class="t">first class, but they're not like 50% off. It might be like five to 10% off on certain airlines. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1216" target="_blank">00:20:16.380</a></span> | <span class="t">if you're regularly paying for international business and first class travel, that might be a really big</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1220" target="_blank">00:20:20.840</a></span> | <span class="t">perk. But if you're using points and miles, you know, that perk is worth nothing. And then finally,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1224" target="_blank">00:20:24.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Amex has their Fine Hotels and Resorts program, which is like their elevated tier of hotels that you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1231" target="_blank">00:20:31.160</a></span> | <span class="t">book through them and get access to perks like free breakfast, upgrade on availability, property credit,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1238" target="_blank">00:20:38.040</a></span> | <span class="t">that kind of stuff. Now, you don't need a platinum card to get access to those. If you go to allthehacks.com</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1242" target="_blank">00:20:42.260</a></span> | <span class="t">slash upgrade, we have the same program. It's also self-serve. You can use it without having any special</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1246" target="_blank">00:20:46.940</a></span> | <span class="t">card.

And that stay doesn't even have to be in your name. But the person who's checking in and staying there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1258" target="_blank">00:20:58.220</a></span> | <span class="t">does need to have an Amex card, but it doesn't have to be a platinum card. So you can also use it on a broader</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1263" target="_blank">00:21:03.660</a></span> | <span class="t">selection of hotels. They call the hotel collection. But on those days, they need to be a minimum of two night stays.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1268" target="_blank">00:21:08.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, that's a platinum card. I do like having the platinum card. I use it for 5x flights. I think the coupons,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1274" target="_blank">00:21:14.380</a></span> | <span class="t">if you will, can offset most of the annual fee for people that use it in that way. But I really think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1280" target="_blank">00:21:20.900</a></span> | <span class="t">it's missing a little something to be an S tier card. But if you use those coupons effectively and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1285" target="_blank">00:21:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">make it a no annual fee card, then you're getting 5x on flights and a lot of lounge access. So for me,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1290" target="_blank">00:21:30.220</a></span> | <span class="t">that's an A tier card, especially if you factor in the signup bonus. But if you are not someone who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1294" target="_blank">00:21:34.380</a></span> | <span class="t">wants to use coupon books, then I don't see a world where you'd be very excited about this card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1299" target="_blank">00:21:39.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, let's talk about the other variations. The two primary personal variations are a Schwab version</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1304" target="_blank">00:21:44.380</a></span> | <span class="t">and a Morgan Stanley version. They are very similar to the personal platinum card with a couple subtle</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1309" target="_blank">00:21:49.400</a></span> | <span class="t">differences. On the Schwab side, the signup bonus right now is way lower. It's 80,000 points after</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1314" target="_blank">00:21:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">8k spend in six months. Recently, it was as high as 125,000. So not the best time to get it. Again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1320" target="_blank">00:22:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">there's these family rules. So once you get one platinum bonus, you can't get another.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1323" target="_blank">00:22:03.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So keep in mind that unless you have a targeted mailer with special language, you can't go getting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1327" target="_blank">00:22:07.960</a></span> | <span class="t">all of these different bonuses. The two unique perks that you get with the Schwab card is that one,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1333" target="_blank">00:22:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">you can use Schwab's platinum card to liquidate your membership rewards points at 1.1 cents up to a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1340" target="_blank">00:22:20.820</a></span> | <span class="t">million points a year, then it drops to 0.8 cents. Now, if you're someone like me who likes to use those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1346" target="_blank">00:22:26.060</a></span> | <span class="t">points to transfer to airlines and hotel groups and book flights, then I think you have a lot better</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1350" target="_blank">00:22:30.760</a></span> | <span class="t">options. If you have an Amex business platinum, we'll talk about how that card lets you redeem</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1355" target="_blank">00:22:35.420</a></span> | <span class="t">your points at about 1.54 cents booking travel in the portal. So I'm not interested in liquidating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1361" target="_blank">00:22:41.480</a></span> | <span class="t">my points at 1.1 cents. However, if you're someone like I was talking to Tim Ferriss in his podcast</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1366" target="_blank">00:22:46.440</a></span> | <span class="t">recently, that just has so many points and doesn't know what to do with them. And it's a lot of hassle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1370" target="_blank">00:22:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">If you were going to try to cash them out and you wanted a way to do that, you could cash out a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1375" target="_blank">00:22:55.060</a></span> | <span class="t">million of them a year at 1.1 cents. That's better than a lot of other options. It's better than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1379" target="_blank">00:22:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">statement credit or Amazon. But for the most part, it's not something that's exciting to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1383" target="_blank">00:23:03.620</a></span> | <span class="t">The only other difference is depending on your balance at Schwab, you get an annual credit towards</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1389" target="_blank">00:23:09.100</a></span> | <span class="t">the card. So if you have $250,000 at Schwab, you get $100. If you have a million dollars with Schwab,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1393" target="_blank">00:23:13.960</a></span> | <span class="t">you get $200. And if you have 10 million with Schwab, you get $1,000. Otherwise, perks, benefits,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1399" target="_blank">00:23:19.140</a></span> | <span class="t">fees, it's almost exactly the same as the personal platinum card. You still get the 5x flights,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1404" target="_blank">00:23:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">1x and everything else. And that's the same for the Morgan Stanley card. The difference there,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1408" target="_blank">00:23:28.760</a></span> | <span class="t">similarly, different bonus. Right now, its bonus is also 80,000 points. After 8,000 spend in six</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1413" target="_blank">00:23:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">months, it has been as high as 150,000 points. The one unique thing you get differently at Morgan</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1418" target="_blank">00:23:38.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Stanley is your first authorized user is free. So the platinum cards, the authorized users I mentioned</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1423" target="_blank">00:23:43.640</a></span> | <span class="t">are $195. The bonus is those authorized users get access to Centurion lounges, Sky Club, Hilton Marriott</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1430" target="_blank">00:23:50.540</a></span> | <span class="t">status, and a global entry credit every four years. So you can have a way to give other people access to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1435" target="_blank">00:23:55.940</a></span> | <span class="t">those lounges without having to spend $75,000. And I would argue the opportunity cost of putting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1442" target="_blank">00:24:02.220</a></span> | <span class="t">$75,000 on another card is probably much greater than $195. So if you really want to get someone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1448" target="_blank">00:24:08.460</a></span> | <span class="t">else access to those lounges, it might make a lot more sense to use the $195 to get an authorized user</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1454" target="_blank">00:24:14.840</a></span> | <span class="t">card and spend that money somewhere else. Or if you're looking to get a platinum card, and you can get a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1459" target="_blank">00:24:19.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Morgan Stanley version of the card, why not do that where your first authorized user is free?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1463" target="_blank">00:24:23.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Now you can also liquidate your membership rewards points, transferring them to your brokerage account</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1467" target="_blank">00:24:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">at Morgan Stanley. It's uncapped here. So you get one cent per point at as many points as you want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1473" target="_blank">00:24:33.220</a></span> | <span class="t">versus Schwab. It was 1.1 cents on the first million, 0.8 cents after that. If you do spend $100,000</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1480" target="_blank">00:24:40.300</a></span> | <span class="t">on the card, you get $500 back, which adds about half a percent return to your spend. So that maybe makes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1487" target="_blank">00:24:47.060</a></span> | <span class="t">it a 1.5x card on everything.

You get your authorized</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1520" target="_blank">00:25:20.300</a></span> | <span class="t">user free. If you decided to spend a ton of money on this card, for some reason, you'd at least get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1524" target="_blank">00:25:24.200</a></span> | <span class="t">a higher return. And you could probably get that annual fee waived without putting too much money</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1528" target="_blank">00:25:28.560</a></span> | <span class="t">at Morgan Stanley. So those are the two kind of off versions of the card. And when I think about them,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1536" target="_blank">00:25:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">they're not enough different about them that I'm going to put them any higher than the A tier,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1540" target="_blank">00:25:40.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I could probably make a case that Morgan Stanley card might bump up to the S tier. And in fact,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1545" target="_blank">00:25:45.140</a></span> | <span class="t">I think I'm going to do that only because if you can get the annual fee waived, and you can get the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1550" target="_blank">00:25:50.660</a></span> | <span class="t">authorized users, and you can get all the perks, that would be amazing. So I'll bump that one up as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1555" target="_blank">00:25:55.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm doing this in real time. But the other two, I'll leave at the A tier. Now on the business platinum</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1559" target="_blank">00:25:59.900</a></span> | <span class="t">side, it's a little bit different. You don't get the 5x on flights, but you do get one and a half</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1564" target="_blank">00:26:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">points on all spend over $5,000, as well as on construction materials and supplies, electronic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1572" target="_blank">00:26:12.040</a></span> | <span class="t">goods, software, cloud systems and shipping. Now, one and a half points on your spend is not that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1577" target="_blank">00:26:17.580</a></span> | <span class="t">exciting all around in general, right? There's plenty of 2x everything cards. So this doesn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1582" target="_blank">00:26:22.760</a></span> | <span class="t">make sense for me as a place to spend money. It's a 1x on everything else card. And then you get 5x on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1587" target="_blank">00:26:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">flights and prepaid hotels, but only in Amex travel. So I can't make a strong case for spending a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1592" target="_blank">00:26:32.600</a></span> | <span class="t">money on your business platinum card, unless you have a lot of employees. And I'll get to that in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1596" target="_blank">00:26:36.520</a></span> | <span class="t">a little bit. However, the signup bonus on this card makes it an easy card for many people with a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1602" target="_blank">00:26:42.600</a></span> | <span class="t">business to justify having. And that's because depending on when you get it, and depending on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1607" target="_blank">00:26:47.560</a></span> | <span class="t">what browser you're in, I've seen offers and I've taken advantage of offers myself as high as 250,000</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1614" target="_blank">00:26:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">points, after spending $20,000 in three months. Now, obviously, you need to have $20,000 of spend</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1620" target="_blank">00:27:00.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to make this work. But 250,000 points, especially if you can cash them out at let's call, at least you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1627" target="_blank">00:27:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">could get one and a half cents of value. That's almost $4,000 of benefit for the card. And at a $695</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1633" target="_blank">00:27:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">annual fee, that makes a lot of sense. So if I get a flyer in the mail, offering me a 250,000 point offer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1639" target="_blank">00:27:19.400</a></span> | <span class="t">on this card, even though I already have one, I'm signing up again, if they want to give me that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1643" target="_blank">00:27:23.740</a></span> | <span class="t">bonus again. So the website right now has 150,000 point on $20,000 spend in three month offer. They</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1650" target="_blank">00:27:30.680</a></span> | <span class="t">also are going to give you $500 credit after you spend $2,500 on flights, we could book those flights</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1656" target="_blank">00:27:36.120</a></span> | <span class="t">directly with airlines. So if you're going to spend $2,500 on flights in the next three months, you could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1659" target="_blank">00:27:39.720</a></span> | <span class="t">bump that bonus up even more. And I think that $500 credit on flights applies to those $250,000 offers as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1666" target="_blank">00:27:46.600</a></span> | <span class="t">well. Now they have announced that those $250,000 offers are going away on June 30. So four days after</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1672" target="_blank">00:27:52.820</a></span> | <span class="t">recording before this episode will come out, who knows what they will be in the future. But I just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1677" target="_blank">00:27:57.340</a></span> | <span class="t">want to flag that the really exciting thing about the business platinum card, similar to the Amex</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1681" target="_blank">00:28:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">personal platinum is the lounge access. But it's also the fact that you get really, really wild welcome</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1686" target="_blank">00:28:06.680</a></span> | <span class="t">bonuses. And the business platinum specifically has a feature where when you book flights in their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1693" target="_blank">00:28:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Amex travel portal, you can actually get a rebate of 35% of the points you use. What that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1699" target="_blank">00:28:19.980</a></span> | <span class="t">effectively means is if you had a flight that cost 100,000 points, because it was $1,000 flight, you'd get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1705" target="_blank">00:28:25.260</a></span> | <span class="t">back 35,000 of those points, which means it only actually cost you 65,000 points, which means your points are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1711" target="_blank">00:28:31.540</a></span> | <span class="t">being worth 1.54 cents. Now, I had this fun conversation on Tim Ferriss's podcast, where I helped him figure out how to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1718" target="_blank">00:28:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">burn his 15 million points that he's accumulated and never used. And my message to him was the easiest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1724" target="_blank">00:28:44.300</a></span> | <span class="t">way for you as someone who doesn't have a lot of flexibility is just book your flights with Amex travel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1728" target="_blank">00:28:48.460</a></span> | <span class="t">on your business platinum card, and get that 35% rebate and cash out all your points effectively at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1734" target="_blank">00:28:54.120</a></span> | <span class="t">about 1.54 cents. However, one thing to note, you only get that 35% rebate on a million points rebated a year,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1741" target="_blank">00:29:01.580</a></span> | <span class="t">which is about 2.8 million points redeemed in total. So in that case of Tavares trying to liquidate 15</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1747" target="_blank">00:29:07.780</a></span> | <span class="t">million, it would take him somewhere around five and a half, six years to get through all of them because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1752" target="_blank">00:29:12.540</a></span> | <span class="t">there is a cap on that 35% rebate. Now, recently, they made one change, which is a little bit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1756" target="_blank">00:29:16.780</a></span> | <span class="t">disappointing, which is that you're no longer going to be able to do that on any international airline</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1762" target="_blank">00:29:22.980</a></span> | <span class="t">flying business class. You're only able to do it on the airline you've selected each year. So if you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1769" target="_blank">00:29:29.140</a></span> | <span class="t">someone who flies the same airline a lot, and most of those airlines have to be US airlines. So if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1773" target="_blank">00:29:33.140</a></span> | <span class="t">you're flying United or Delta or American a lot, you can use your business platinum card and get 1.54</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1778" target="_blank">00:29:38.120</a></span> | <span class="t">cents on your Amex points. Now, obviously, I think you could transfer them to airlines and get a much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1782" target="_blank">00:29:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">better value than you would get there. But I think it's a really compelling option if you're trying to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1787" target="_blank">00:29:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">cash out your points. Now, almost all of the benefits and perks of the personal platinum apply here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1793" target="_blank">00:29:53.300</a></span> | <span class="t">except some of those credits. And so I'm just going to go through the credits here because they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1797" target="_blank">00:29:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">different. And so perks wise, you still get the lounge access, you still get fine hotels and resorts, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1802" target="_blank">00:30:02.940</a></span> | <span class="t">still get the global entry, you still get Hilton and Marriott status, you get the car rental statuses, you get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1808" target="_blank">00:30:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">their trip delay and cancellation insurance. The things that are different is you get a $10 a month wireless</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1814" target="_blank">00:30:14.580</a></span> | <span class="t">credit for paying your wireless bill, you also get cell phone protection, you get a $90 a quarter Indeed credit,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1820" target="_blank">00:30:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">which I've never used in any way, shape or form, you get $150 a year credit with Adobe Creative Cloud,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1825" target="_blank">00:30:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I've never used ever on any of my cards. So I value that at zero, you used to get $200 every six months</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1830" target="_blank">00:30:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">at Dell. Now you get $150 a year plus another 1000 if you spend 5000. So if you're someone who for your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1837" target="_blank">00:30:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">company is buying computers at Dell, then getting 1000 off 5000 plus $150 that's going to pay for the annual fee</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1843" target="_blank">00:30:43.660</a></span> | <span class="t">on its own. So that's pretty amazing. So the other credits you get, you get $50 a quarter at Hilton,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1848" target="_blank">00:30:48.440</a></span> | <span class="t">you do also get that airline credit of $200 and the $199 clear credit. So you're not getting the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1854" target="_blank">00:30:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Saks, Uber and entertainment and fine hotels and resorts credits. But I think you're getting everything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1858" target="_blank">00:30:58.920</a></span> | <span class="t">else. Oh, and you're not getting the Equinox credit. So I think that sums up the business platinum</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1862" target="_blank">00:31:02.940</a></span> | <span class="t">card. When it comes to how I would rank this on the list, I would have to put the business platinum at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1868" target="_blank">00:31:08.560</a></span> | <span class="t">the B tier. And the primary reason I put it below the personal, yes, you still get the lounge access.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1873" target="_blank">00:31:13.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, you get a lot of things. However, there's just no compelling reason to spend on this card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1877" target="_blank">00:31:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">With the personal platinum, you can spend 5x on flights. I think that's really, really compelling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1881" target="_blank">00:31:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that the perks and the benefits are a little more interesting to the average person.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1886" target="_blank">00:31:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's pretty hard to get value from the Indeed credit or the Adobe credit, or maybe even the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1890" target="_blank">00:31:30.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Dell credit. So the credits are a little less valuable, the spending bonuses are a little less</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1893" target="_blank">00:31:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">valuable, but you still get that lounge access and huge welcome bonuses. So that's why I put it at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=1898" target="_blank">00:31:38.380</a></span> | <span class="t">B tier.

You get a PS membership, which is like a private terminal in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=2166" target="_blank">00:36:06.180</a></span> | <span class="t">LA and Atlanta.

And the other big things, I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=2177" target="_blank">00:36:17.640</a></span> | <span class="t">on the personal side, you get a 20% rebate in Travel Portal, which makes your points worth 1.25 cents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=2183" target="_blank">00:36:23.060</a></span> | <span class="t">On the business side, you actually get a 50% rebate, which means your points are worth 2 cents,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=2187" target="_blank">00:36:27.060</a></span> | <span class="t">which is really, really awesome.

It's capped at 3 million points a year. I think that's redeemed. So it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=2201" target="_blank">00:36:41.380</a></span> | <span class="t">probably 6 million points a year spent.

So let's first start with cashback cards. The first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=2383" target="_blank">00:39:43.060</a></span> | <span class="t">cashback card is the blue cash everyday card.

And then after that, it is a 1% card. The signup bonus right now is $200 on 2000 spend in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=2400" target="_blank">00:40:00.980</a></span> | <span class="t">six months.

This card is not that exciting to me. Yes, it's a no annual fee card, but you're not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=2435" target="_blank">00:40:35.220</a></span> | <span class="t">getting access to membership rewards.

Now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=2505" target="_blank">00:41:45.220</a></span> | <span class="t">if you spend a ton on streaming, maybe this is interesting.

Now for a lot of people, $180 extra dollars a year for a $95 annual fee card,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=2524" target="_blank">00:42:04.340</a></span> | <span class="t">that's great. But keep in mind that $95 is half of that incremental amount. So you're actually going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=2529" target="_blank">00:42:09.540</a></span> | <span class="t">be getting less than $100 of incremental value.

I'll probably put it at B tier. I know some people are going to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=2555" target="_blank">00:42:35.620</a></span> | <span class="t">disappointed by that because they love this card.

So for me, that's just not going to cut it for being too much higher on that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=2571" target="_blank">00:42:51.700</a></span> | <span class="t">list.

I feel like on one argument, I should put it at B tier because it's similar to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=2601" target="_blank">00:43:21.300</a></span> | <span class="t">the other card, right?

So let's run through the cards. So first is the Delta blue. It's a $0 annual fee card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=2777" target="_blank">00:46:17.540</a></span> | <span class="t">You get two X points on Delta, two X points on restaurants, one X on everything else.

The only reason I see to have this card is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=2793" target="_blank">00:46:33.620</a></span> | <span class="t">if you had one of the other Delta cards and you don't want to pay an annual fee, but you want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=2798" target="_blank">00:46:38.100</a></span> | <span class="t">continue to have this card hitting your credit, you could downgrade to the blue card with no annual fee and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=2803" target="_blank">00:46:43.220</a></span> | <span class="t">keep that card helping your credit and the history because you've had it for a long time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=2807" target="_blank">00:46:47.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Otherwise, I see no real reason to have this card. As far as the tier list goes, I would put it at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=2813" target="_blank">00:46:53.460</a></span> | <span class="t">very bottom. It is a D tier card. There's no real reason to use it. If you're spending a lot of money</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=2818" target="_blank">00:46:58.820</a></span> | <span class="t">on Delta, you could earn a lot more Delta points.

So the reason to have them is primarily that you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=2836" target="_blank">00:47:16.260</a></span> | <span class="t">going to be able to earn medallion qualifying dollars, which is how you earn status with Delta</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=2840" target="_blank">00:47:20.740</a></span> | <span class="t">with some of these cards. And many of the cards also give you a head start towards that status.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=2845" target="_blank">00:47:25.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So the primary reason to have a Delta card is that you either fly Delta a lot and want some of the perks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=2850" target="_blank">00:47:30.660</a></span> | <span class="t">or you want to help boost your way towards status. That is why you would get a Delta card,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=2854" target="_blank">00:47:34.820</a></span> | <span class="t">not because it's going to be an amazing ROI card on your spend. Or I guess the other reason,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=2860" target="_blank">00:47:40.420</a></span> | <span class="t">which is why I have a Delta card is that the 15% off is worth having. So I've racked up a few</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=2866" target="_blank">00:47:46.020</a></span> | <span class="t">hundred thousand Delta miles over the years, and now I will get 15% discount on all my redemptions of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=2872" target="_blank">00:47:52.740</a></span> | <span class="t">those miles. And I think the perks make up for the annual fee. I chose to get a business card. So that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=2877" target="_blank">00:47:57.620</a></span> | <span class="t">means that it's not really going to affect my credit because it's not going to show up on my credit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=2880" target="_blank">00:48:00.980</a></span> | <span class="t">report. So for me, that made sense. But let's run through them. So we've got the Delta gold card,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=2885" target="_blank">00:48:05.300</a></span> | <span class="t">$150 annual fee, 2x on Delta, 2x on restaurants, 2x on grocery, 1x on everything else.

It's been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=2896" target="_blank">00:48:16.740</a></span> | <span class="t">80,000 a lot and that's on 3,000 spend in six months. You get a $200 Delta credit after you spend</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=2902" target="_blank">00:48:22.580</a></span> | <span class="t">$10,000 in a year and you get $100 credit towards Delta stays, which is their hotel portal. On the business</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=2908" target="_blank">00:48:28.420</a></span> | <span class="t">side, kind of similar. $150 annual fee, 2x Delta, 2x restaurants. Instead of groceries, you get ads</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=2914" target="_blank">00:48:34.020</a></span> | <span class="t">and shipping as a 2x category up to $50,000 each. The signup bonus is about 10,000 points higher. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=2920" target="_blank">00:48:40.100</a></span> | <span class="t">90,000 on 6k spend in six months.

So in summary, the gold version of this card, whether it's personal or business is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=2936" target="_blank">00:48:56.260</a></span> | <span class="t">primarily beneficial, not for someone who's chasing status because the Platinum and Reserves are going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=2940" target="_blank">00:49:00.820</a></span> | <span class="t">to really help with that.

Once you've had the reserve,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=2982" target="_blank">00:49:42.020</a></span> | <span class="t">you're ineligible for the bonuses on the lower tier cards.

If you're flying Delta</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3492" target="_blank">00:58:12.980</a></span> | <span class="t">hundreds of times, you need to spend money on this card to be able to get access to those sky clubs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3497" target="_blank">00:58:17.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm going to put the business version of the card a little higher. I'm going to call it an A tier</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3502" target="_blank">00:58:22.500</a></span> | <span class="t">card because it's the best way to spend your way towards Delta status. You get into Delta lounges,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3506" target="_blank">00:58:26.980</a></span> | <span class="t">you get into Amex lounges, you've got companion certificates and $30 a month of credits that I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3512" target="_blank">00:58:32.580</a></span> | <span class="t">are pretty easy to use. And so I think it's a pretty good card. The signup bonus at 110,000 points,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3517" target="_blank">00:58:37.460</a></span> | <span class="t">the fact that it doesn't show up on your personal credit report is great.

And there's probably just a slight edge to the business version</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3531" target="_blank">00:58:51.620</a></span> | <span class="t">of the card. That is why I moved it up next. Let's talk Hilton. This is one where I know a lot more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3535" target="_blank">00:58:55.700</a></span> | <span class="t">because we've had a couple different versions of the Hilton card and keep in mind when you're looking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3539" target="_blank">00:58:59.780</a></span> | <span class="t">within these co-brand cards, you can move around them. So if you have the Delta reserve, you can downgrade</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3544" target="_blank">00:59:04.500</a></span> | <span class="t">to the platinum. If you have the Hilton surpassed, you can upgrade to the aspire and you can kind of move</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3548" target="_blank">00:59:08.260</a></span> | <span class="t">around as you see fit.

So on the Hilton side, there are four cards. Okay. On the standard</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3562" target="_blank">00:59:22.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Hilton card, $0 annual fee, 7x points on Hilton, 5x on gas, grocery and restaurants, 3x and everything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3569" target="_blank">00:59:29.460</a></span> | <span class="t">else. Now it's important to understand that Hilton points in general are much less valuable than airline</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3574" target="_blank">00:59:34.820</a></span> | <span class="t">miles or transferable membership rewards points. You can often buy them for as little as half a cent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3579" target="_blank">00:59:39.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So when I hear 3x everything, that's, oh, wow, there aren't a lot of 3x everything cards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3584" target="_blank">00:59:44.100</a></span> | <span class="t">But when it comes to Hilton points, I think you should view that as a one and a half x everything card</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3587" target="_blank">00:59:47.940</a></span> | <span class="t">at the maximum. So 7x Hilton sounds like a lot, but it's probably the equivalent of three and a half percent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3594" target="_blank">00:59:54.420</a></span> | <span class="t">back on Hilton. If you value Hilton points at half a cent. Now, can you get higher value? Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3598" target="_blank">00:59:58.980</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you could just buy them at half a cent, it would be hard to value them at much higher than that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3604" target="_blank">01:00:04.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Sign up bonuses are also pretty generous in terms of number of points. But keep in mind,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3608" target="_blank">01:00:08.740</a></span> | <span class="t">the points are less valuable than many other points. So on the standard card, you've got 100,000</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3613" target="_blank">01:00:13.540</a></span> | <span class="t">points plus $100 statement credit after spending $2,000 in six months. It has been as high as 150,000</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3619" target="_blank">01:00:19.220</a></span> | <span class="t">points once. Otherwise, 100,000 is pretty much as high as it goes. There's not a ton of perks on this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3624" target="_blank">01:00:24.740</a></span> | <span class="t">card. You get Hilton silver status.

Not a huge fan of the standard Hilton card. I'd</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3634" target="_blank">01:00:34.740</a></span> | <span class="t">probably put it in D tier if it didn't have 100,000 point signup bonus. So I'll put it at C tier. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3639" target="_blank">01:00:39.700</a></span> | <span class="t">it's not a card I'm really excited to have unless you stay at Hilton a lot and want to earn seven points</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3644" target="_blank">01:00:44.180</a></span> | <span class="t">on Hilton. I could probably make an argument to put it down in D tier. But I do think that being able to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3648" target="_blank">01:00:48.580</a></span> | <span class="t">earn 7x on Hilton for a zero annual fee card is not terrible. And actually getting 5x gas grocery</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3654" target="_blank">01:00:54.420</a></span> | <span class="t">restaurants, if you're really into the Hilton ecosystem is like a two and a half on all of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3658" target="_blank">01:00:58.820</a></span> | <span class="t">those categories. So that probably makes it slightly better than a D tier card. But there's not a lot to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3663" target="_blank">01:01:03.380</a></span> | <span class="t">love about it. However, I do like the next two cards. So you've got the Hilton surpass, which is $150</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3668" target="_blank">01:01:08.420</a></span> | <span class="t">annual fee card, you get 12x points on Hilton. So a lot more 6x on gas grocery restaurants, 4x on online</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3675" target="_blank">01:01:15.700</a></span> | <span class="t">retail and 3x on everything else. Now again, Hilton points aren't worth as much as a lot of other points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3681" target="_blank">01:01:21.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's hard to kind of reset your brain. I view this more as, you know, 6% back on Hilton,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3686" target="_blank">01:01:26.100</a></span> | <span class="t">3% back on gas grocery restaurants, 2% back on online retail and one and a half on everything else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3691" target="_blank">01:01:31.700</a></span> | <span class="t">That's not a bad lineup of earnings. The signup bonus is pretty generous right now. It's 130,000</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3696" target="_blank">01:01:36.900</a></span> | <span class="t">points on 3k spend in six months, it has been as high as 150,000 points.

You do get Hilton gold status, which is a daily food and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3717" target="_blank">01:01:57.700</a></span> | <span class="t">beverage credit or continental breakfast, but you don't get diamond status unless you spend $40,000</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3722" target="_blank">01:02:02.020</a></span> | <span class="t">on the card. You also get a $50 a quarter Hilton credit. So if you stay at Hilton's four times a year,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3728" target="_blank">01:02:08.420</a></span> | <span class="t">it pays for the annual fee. And then if you spend $15,000 a year on the card, you get a free night</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3734" target="_blank">01:02:14.260</a></span> | <span class="t">certificate. And that free night certificate can be super valuable. We're about to go to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3738" target="_blank">01:02:18.260</a></span> | <span class="t">the Waldorf Astoria in Costa Rica. We're going to use six of them on stays that would have normally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3742" target="_blank">01:02:22.340</a></span> | <span class="t">cost over a thousand dollars a night. But I could have used 120,000 points on each of those stays.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3747" target="_blank">01:02:27.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And so if I could buy those points at half a cent, it's hard to value those certificates at more than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3752" target="_blank">01:02:32.980</a></span> | <span class="t">$600. But even if you're getting a $600 certificate on $15,000 to spend, that's like 4% back on top of all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3759" target="_blank">01:02:39.940</a></span> | <span class="t">the other points you're earning. So if you're earning 4x points on online retail or 2% in Hilton</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3764" target="_blank">01:02:44.740</a></span> | <span class="t">value, and then you're also getting another 4% towards that free night certificate, that's like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3769" target="_blank">01:02:49.460</a></span> | <span class="t">a 6% back on online retail card, which is pretty interesting. And that goes to 7% on gas, grocery,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3775" target="_blank">01:02:55.460</a></span> | <span class="t">and restaurants. So spending $15,000 on this card to get that free night certificate is a no-brainer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3779" target="_blank">01:02:59.620</a></span> | <span class="t">You also get national executive status, which is cool.

We've held this card</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3784" target="_blank">01:03:04.340</a></span> | <span class="t">multiple years in the past.

I really like the surpass card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3788" target="_blank">01:03:08.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Definitely great for getting access to Hilton free night certificates, but you do have to spend to get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3792" target="_blank">01:03:12.500</a></span> | <span class="t">it.

It's one of my favorites.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3797" target="_blank">01:03:17.140</a></span> | <span class="t">We hold two of them right now.

You get a clear credit of $199 a year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3862" target="_blank">01:04:22.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And then one perk that I don't ever use that I don't think is valuable, you get $100 property</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3865" target="_blank">01:04:25.860</a></span> | <span class="t">credit at Waldorf and Conrad. But you have to do a two nights day, you have to book it through their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3870" target="_blank">01:04:30.180</a></span> | <span class="t">site. And I just don't think the rates and the deals are as compelling. So that one I write off at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3874" target="_blank">01:04:34.340</a></span> | <span class="t">nothing. Beyond that, you get national executive status, return protection, trip delay, cancellation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3879" target="_blank">01:04:39.220</a></span> | <span class="t">interruption, and cell phone protection. So a lot more purchase and travel protections than the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3884" target="_blank">01:04:44.020</a></span> | <span class="t">average Amex card has. So I love this card, because if you figure you're getting an annual free night</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3888" target="_blank">01:04:48.740</a></span> | <span class="t">certificate, and you're getting a bunch of resort credit that you can use on the stay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3892" target="_blank">01:04:52.980</a></span> | <span class="t">that you're probably using that free night certificate credit. Now keep in mind, it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3896" target="_blank">01:04:56.020</a></span> | <span class="t">only Hilton Resort, so it's not every hotel, plus $50 a quarter of flights. So when I look at this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3901" target="_blank">01:05:01.700</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm getting at least $200 on the flight credit, because I just can either buy a flight or buy travel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3907" target="_blank">01:05:07.300</a></span> | <span class="t">credit on an airline I fly. So $200 there, at least $600 of value from the free night certificate,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3913" target="_blank">01:05:13.220</a></span> | <span class="t">and $400 on the resort credit. Let's say you only use that once a year. So it's only $200.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3918" target="_blank">01:05:18.100</a></span> | <span class="t">You're still getting over $1,000 of value on a card that you're paying $550 for. And that's valuing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3924" target="_blank">01:05:24.340</a></span> | <span class="t">the clear credit at nothing. That's not including the fact that if you were to spend $30,000 on this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3929" target="_blank">01:05:29.140</a></span> | <span class="t">card, you get another free night certificate. So I love the Hilton Aspire card. Oh, and also,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3934" target="_blank">01:05:34.180</a></span> | <span class="t">you're getting Hilton Diamond status, their top tier of status. So I think the Hilton Aspire card's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3938" target="_blank">01:05:38.180</a></span> | <span class="t">an S tier card. It's one of my favorite cards. I don't think we'll ever not have this card. Now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3942" target="_blank">01:05:42.260</a></span> | <span class="t">one advanced strategy is you could downgrade and upgrade between these cards. If you search online,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3945" target="_blank">01:05:45.700</a></span> | <span class="t">you'll find a few articles of people that detail how it works. And I think that doing that is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3950" target="_blank">01:05:50.660</a></span> | <span class="t">even further way to optimize your Hilton cards. So love the Hilton Aspire. Last one's a Hilton</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3955" target="_blank">01:05:55.060</a></span> | <span class="t">business card. It's $195 annual fee. You get 12x on Hilton, 5x on everything else, no other bonuses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3961" target="_blank">01:06:01.780</a></span> | <span class="t">It does have a really high signup bonus right now, 150,000 points after spending 8k in six months,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3966" target="_blank">01:06:06.580</a></span> | <span class="t">plus another 25k if you spend 2000 more in six months. So that's 175k total. In the past,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3974" target="_blank">01:06:14.580</a></span> | <span class="t">there has been 150k plus a free night certificate, which I would prefer. So in general, anytime these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3980" target="_blank">01:06:20.340</a></span> | <span class="t">cards all offer a bonus free night certificate for signing up, that's a great time to get them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3984" target="_blank">01:06:24.180</a></span> | <span class="t">It comes with Hilton gold status or diamond. If you spend 40,000, it comes with national executive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3989" target="_blank">01:06:29.780</a></span> | <span class="t">status and it comes with a $60 a quarter Hilton credit. So this card is not that exciting to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3994" target="_blank">01:06:34.980</a></span> | <span class="t">I think for the signup bonus, it's kind of somewhat interesting, right? If you can get 150,000 points</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=3999" target="_blank">01:06:39.860</a></span> | <span class="t">plus free night certificate for a business card with $195 annual fee, I think the ROI is there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4004" target="_blank">01:06:44.980</a></span> | <span class="t">I think getting 5x on everything in the form of Hilton points is like a two and a half percent back card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4011" target="_blank">01:06:51.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's not the worst card out there. There are not that many cards that earn that much,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4015" target="_blank">01:06:55.620</a></span> | <span class="t">but your points are locked up in Hilton versus a lot of other cards where if you were just earning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4020" target="_blank">01:07:00.420</a></span> | <span class="t">two and a half percent in cash and you use that to buy Hilton if you want it or not, but there's no way</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4024" target="_blank">01:07:04.820</a></span> | <span class="t">to earn free night certificates on this card. So I would probably call this a C tier card because I just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4030" target="_blank">01:07:10.100</a></span> | <span class="t">think that if you're going to go all in on Hilton, get the aspire, the surpass, the business card is just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4034" target="_blank">01:07:14.740</a></span> | <span class="t">not as exciting. So that's a Hilton cards. Let's talk about Marriott cards. So first is the Marriott</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4038" target="_blank">01:07:18.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Bonvoy card. And you can't apply for this card directly. It was formerly the SPG card. You can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4043" target="_blank">01:07:23.860</a></span> | <span class="t">product change to it. I actually have it from having the old SPG card. And it's not that exciting of a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4049" target="_blank">01:07:29.220</a></span> | <span class="t">card. It's a $95 annual fee card. You get 6x points on Bonvoy, 2x on everything else. You get free</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4055" target="_blank">01:07:35.860</a></span> | <span class="t">silver status. And if you spend $35,000, you get gold status. Now it does include one free night</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4060" target="_blank">01:07:40.820</a></span> | <span class="t">certificate every year on anniversary, but it's only up to 35,000 points. You can use 15,000 other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4065" target="_blank">01:07:45.860</a></span> | <span class="t">points to top it up. But finding a hotel that you want to stay at for 50,000 points for a big vacation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4073" target="_blank">01:07:53.780</a></span> | <span class="t">or in a major metro area is really difficult. If you're going to a smaller town or you're going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4078" target="_blank">01:07:58.980</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of international places, it might be a lot easier. But we've actually struggled to get use out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4083" target="_blank">01:08:03.540</a></span> | <span class="t">of this. You're not going to find those kinds of things in a major metro area and a really nice hotel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4089" target="_blank">01:08:09.060</a></span> | <span class="t">or a luxury resort or anything like that. So I think it's a little tricky to get use out of,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4093" target="_blank">01:08:13.220</a></span> | <span class="t">but probably easy enough to get $95 of use out of that stay. You also get 15 elite nights that count</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4100" target="_blank">01:08:20.340</a></span> | <span class="t">towards the number of elite nights you need for status with Marriott. So one reason I have this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4103" target="_blank">01:08:23.940</a></span> | <span class="t">card is to boost you towards your status level on Marriott. They're not cumulative on the personal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4108" target="_blank">01:08:28.900</a></span> | <span class="t">side. So if you have a bunch of personal cards on Marriott and they all give you 15 nights,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4112" target="_blank">01:08:32.980</a></span> | <span class="t">you only get 15. Whereas if you do have a business card, the business 15 and the personal 15 will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4118" target="_blank">01:08:38.260</a></span> | <span class="t">stack to 30. So if you're going for Marriott status and you want to boost, this is the cheapest card</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4123" target="_blank">01:08:43.380</a></span> | <span class="t">to be able to do it. But unless you get a lot of value out of one free night a year at a 35 to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4128" target="_blank">01:08:48.260</a></span> | <span class="t">50,000 point property, it's a pretty expensive card for a somewhat low ROI on all your spend.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4134" target="_blank">01:08:54.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So for that reason, I think it's probably a break-even card. You can't even get it as a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4138" target="_blank">01:08:58.980</a></span> | <span class="t">new card. There's no signup bonus. I'm not really excited about this card. I'm going to put it at C tier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4145" target="_blank">01:09:05.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Next card on the list is the Bonvoy Bevy card. You'll notice that all of the Marriott cards have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4150" target="_blank">01:09:10.580</a></span> | <span class="t">a B name. So Brilliant and Bevy and Boundless and that kind of stuff. So a little bit of alliteration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4155" target="_blank">01:09:15.620</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a 250 annual fee card. You get 6x on Bonvoy, 4x on grocery and restaurant up to $15,000 a year,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4163" target="_blank">01:09:23.540</a></span> | <span class="t">and 2x on everything else. I kind of value Marriott points at 0.6 to 0.7 cents,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4168" target="_blank">01:09:28.580</a></span> | <span class="t">which makes the what is this card really worth math a little trickier. So it's like 2.8% on grocery and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4174" target="_blank">01:09:34.580</a></span> | <span class="t">restaurants and 1.4% on everything else. So on a spending basis, not an exciting card. Signup bonus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4181" target="_blank">01:09:41.620</a></span> | <span class="t">right now is 135,000 points. You get 85,000 on 5,000 spend in six months. Another 50,000 if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4188" target="_blank">01:09:48.820</a></span> | <span class="t">spend 2,000 more in six months. Somewhat regularly, it goes up to 155,000 total. One of the perks here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4195" target="_blank">01:09:55.460</a></span> | <span class="t">if you do a lot of stays at Marriott, I guess this could be lucrative. You get an extra 1,000 points for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4200" target="_blank">01:10:00.260</a></span> | <span class="t">every stay as long as you book that stay directly. You do get Bonvoy gold status, which is not that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4205" target="_blank">01:10:05.220</a></span> | <span class="t">exciting. And then you get a 50,000 point free night certificate, but only after you spend $15,000.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4211" target="_blank">01:10:11.060</a></span> | <span class="t">You get trip delay coverage, which isn't always normal for every card and you get premium internet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4215" target="_blank">01:10:15.060</a></span> | <span class="t">For $250, I want more out of a card, right? If I'm getting a hotel card, if I look at the Hilton card</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4221" target="_blank">01:10:21.380</a></span> | <span class="t">and I look at what I'm getting with the surpass, it's just so much more than I'm getting or could get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4226" target="_blank">01:10:26.660</a></span> | <span class="t">with this Bonvoy bevy card. And so I'm not excited about this card. I'll put it in the C tier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4231" target="_blank">01:10:31.940</a></span> | <span class="t">It's probably better than, you know, the cards I'm putting in the D tier, but I'm not very excited</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4237" target="_blank">01:10:37.460</a></span> | <span class="t">about this card at all. Next is a Bonvoy brilliant card. This is a card I actually have. It has a really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4241" target="_blank">01:10:41.620</a></span> | <span class="t">high annual fee at $650. It still earns the same 6x at Bonvoy, but you get 3x flights, 3x restaurants,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4247" target="_blank">01:10:47.540</a></span> | <span class="t">2x everything else. So on the earning side, again, if you value Marriott points at 0.7 cents,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4253" target="_blank">01:10:53.460</a></span> | <span class="t">2.1 on flights and restaurants, 1.4 on everything else, not an exciting card to spend on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4258" target="_blank">01:10:58.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Sign up bonus right now is 150,000 points.

So if you're looking at this card</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4274" target="_blank">01:11:14.500</a></span> | <span class="t">and you can wait for a free night certificate, that'd probably be a much better offer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4278" target="_blank">01:11:18.180</a></span> | <span class="t">The primary reason you'd get this card and the reason I got this card was that you get free</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4282" target="_blank">01:11:22.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Bonvoy platinum status, which includes the breakfast offering and includes upgrades and the upgrades</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4287" target="_blank">01:11:27.220</a></span> | <span class="t">include standard sweets. So that's one compelling reason. And the other is that the high annual fee</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4293" target="_blank">01:11:33.140</a></span> | <span class="t">can be offset by primarily two of the benefits. So one, you get a $25 a month dining credit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4299" target="_blank">01:11:39.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So that $25 a month is at any restaurant. You just spend $25 or more at a restaurant, you get a credit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4304" target="_blank">01:11:44.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So for me, it's pretty easy to spend $25 a month at a restaurant. That's easily worth that $300 a year</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4310" target="_blank">01:11:50.900</a></span> | <span class="t">because we use that credit every month. I think there was one month we forgot and I just bought</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4314" target="_blank">01:11:54.420</a></span> | <span class="t">a $25 gift card at a restaurant and that credited as well. So that brings the annual fee down to 350.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4319" target="_blank">01:11:59.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you get an annual 85,000 point free night certificate. Now you can also add on up to 15,000</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4325" target="_blank">01:12:05.220</a></span> | <span class="t">points, making it a 100,000 point stay.

So that's something that I think is pretty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4340" target="_blank">01:12:20.740</a></span> | <span class="t">easy to get way more than $300 of value out of.

The reason that I got this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4359" target="_blank">01:12:39.940</a></span> | <span class="t">card was actually that you can get to lifetime platinum status with Marriott if you have platinum</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4365" target="_blank">01:12:45.300</a></span> | <span class="t">status for 10 years and I think you need 600 nights at Marriott.

It was just a target. I wanted to hit it and be done. And originally when I got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4379" target="_blank">01:12:59.220</a></span> | <span class="t">this card, I thought I'm going to hit that and I'm going to cancel this card. I'm not going to hold onto</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4382" target="_blank">01:13:02.420</a></span> | <span class="t">it because now I have platinum for life. Who cares? And that might still be the case. But as I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4387" target="_blank">01:13:07.540</a></span> | <span class="t">thinking about it, the $25 a month dining credit, there's a little overhead to having to do it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4392" target="_blank">01:13:12.100</a></span> | <span class="t">but it's pretty easy to get that value out of. And that free night certificate, I'm fairly certain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4396" target="_blank">01:13:16.020</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to be getting more than $350 of value because 100,000 Marriott points is probably worth $500</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4401" target="_blank">01:13:21.940</a></span> | <span class="t">plus in terms of the stays that I would regularly book with it. So maybe I'll keep this card for a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4407" target="_blank">01:13:27.540</a></span> | <span class="t">long time.

But all the other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4412" target="_blank">01:13:32.020</a></span> | <span class="t">benefits aren't that exciting to me.

I'm also excluding some of the third party cards that aren't ones you would necessarily get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4654" target="_blank">01:17:34.340</a></span> | <span class="t">from American Express. So the Coinbase card that's coming out, which by now I will have talked about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4658" target="_blank">01:17:38.820</a></span> | <span class="t">briefly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4659" target="_blank">01:17:39.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there's a Schwab investor card that you don't get from Amex. So I'm excluding those cards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4667" target="_blank">01:17:47.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So last two are the Amazon cards. There's the Amazon business, Amazon business prime. If you don't have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4672" target="_blank">01:17:52.020</a></span> | <span class="t">an Amazon prime, you're getting 3% on Amazon, 2% on gas, restaurants, and phone, and $100 signup bonus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4679" target="_blank">01:17:59.940</a></span> | <span class="t">This is not exciting to me at all in any way, shape, or form D tier card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4684" target="_blank">01:18:04.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, if you have Amazon prime and you get the Amazon business prime card, you're getting 5%</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4688" target="_blank">01:18:08.900</a></span> | <span class="t">on Amazon, and then the same 2% on gas, restaurants, and phone with a $125 signup bonus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4695" target="_blank">01:18:15.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So $125 over $100, no one's getting this card for the signup bonus. That's not really exciting to me at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4700" target="_blank">01:18:20.900</a></span> | <span class="t">all. However, the reason to get this card is if you spend a lot for your business on Amazon,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4705" target="_blank">01:18:25.620</a></span> | <span class="t">you're getting 5% back. And so where this card falls on the spectrum really depends on how much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4709" target="_blank">01:18:29.860</a></span> | <span class="t">you spend on Amazon.

And I'll probably put it on A tier because 5% back on a place you can buy an extremely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4719" target="_blank">01:18:39.460</a></span> | <span class="t">large quantity of stuff for no annual fee is interesting.

But that 5% on Amazon,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4730" target="_blank">01:18:50.580</a></span> | <span class="t">we have an Amazon prime card, we have the personal one, and we use it for all of our Amazon spend.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4734" target="_blank">01:18:54.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Now that it's pretty tough to get Amazon gift cards for any less than that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4739" target="_blank">01:18:59.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So that is all the Amex cards.

So first off, a few other things about the Amex platform</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4762" target="_blank">01:19:22.500</a></span> | <span class="t">that I really love that I want to talk about. So first off is Amex offers. So every single one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4767" target="_blank">01:19:27.300</a></span> | <span class="t">of these Amex cards we've talked about has the ability to enroll in offers. And how this works,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4772" target="_blank">01:19:32.180</a></span> | <span class="t">we've talked about card linked offers before. I think Amex has some of the best. So you can go in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4777" target="_blank">01:19:37.220</a></span> | <span class="t">and you can look at all of these offers with different brands and add them to your cards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4781" target="_blank">01:19:41.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And I looked and amongst all the Amex cards I've had over the lifetime of those cards,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4786" target="_blank">01:19:46.420</a></span> | <span class="t">I've earned over $2,000 in Amex offer rewards.

Things like earning $45 at Mint Mobile, earning $25 at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4799" target="_blank">01:19:59.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Love Every, $100 at Home Depot, $100 at Best Buy, $100 at Dell, $60 at Marriott, $60 at Delta,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4805" target="_blank">01:20:05.300</a></span> | <span class="t">and so on and so on. A ton of great offers. I love adding Amex offers and seeing what's in there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4810" target="_blank">01:20:10.420</a></span> | <span class="t">because every time I look, it feels like there's at least one thing that I might be spending money on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4814" target="_blank">01:20:14.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Now it's a lot of overhead to keep track of them. And once you add one of the offers to one card,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4820" target="_blank">01:20:20.180</a></span> | <span class="t">even though you might see it on multiple cards, it typically goes away from those other cards,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4824" target="_blank">01:20:24.660</a></span> | <span class="t">unless you add it on all cards at the same time. That's something really hard to do manually on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4828" target="_blank">01:20:28.900</a></span> | <span class="t">your own.

That means that if you had a $50 off $200 Home Depot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4845" target="_blank">01:20:45.140</a></span> | <span class="t">credit, you could use that on all of the Amex cards you have and get it multiple times. So that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4851" target="_blank">01:20:51.220</a></span> | <span class="t">probably why I've been able to get so much value because sometimes there's an offer and it might be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=4855" target="_blank">01:20:55.300</a></span> | <span class="t">$100 at Best Buy and I can put it on three different cards.

And if they sign up for cards, you earn membership rewards points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=5147" target="_blank">01:25:47.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Or if you're referring cards in the Hilton or Marriott or Delta portfolio, you might earn points</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=5152" target="_blank">01:25:52.340</a></span> | <span class="t">and miles in those programs. And it doesn't have to be that someone signs up for the exact card you have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=5157" target="_blank">01:25:57.860</a></span> | <span class="t">I know if you look at my Hilton referral link, it actually shows all the Hilton cards.

Let's see on the business cards. One of the other things I really like about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=5224" target="_blank">01:27:04.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Amex is they sometimes offer bonuses for adding employees to your cards. So let's say you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=5229" target="_blank">01:27:09.460</a></span> | <span class="t">three employees. They might say if you add an employee card and they spend $4,000 on the card,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=5233" target="_blank">01:27:13.780</a></span> | <span class="t">you might get 7,000 membership rewards points.

One other thing, which maybe isn't a thing to love,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=5264" target="_blank">01:27:44.580</a></span> | <span class="t">but it's a thing to know is that because Amex cards do not come with primary rental car coverage,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=5269" target="_blank">01:27:49.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Amex has created this premium rental car protection program where if you enroll almost every Amex card</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=5275" target="_blank">01:27:55.060</a></span> | <span class="t">in it, you do get primary coverage for up to 42 days on any of your rental cars. However, you pay $20</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=5281" target="_blank">01:28:01.940</a></span> | <span class="t">to $25 per rental and you can't selectively enable it. So once you enable it for a card,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=5288" target="_blank">01:28:08.020</a></span> | <span class="t">anytime there's an Avis charge, anytime there's a Hertz charge, you're going to get charged that $25</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=5292" target="_blank">01:28:12.580</a></span> | <span class="t">or $20 and it's going to activate for that rental. So keep that in mind. I don't ever use this except</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=5298" target="_blank">01:28:18.420</a></span> | <span class="t">for a couple of reasons. There are a few vehicle types. Maybe it's a truck that might not be covered</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=5302" target="_blank">01:28:22.820</a></span> | <span class="t">by your other rental car coverage.

But do keep in mind that you have to hit those minimum spends. So make sure you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=5836" target="_blank">01:37:16.420</a></span> | <span class="t">can do that before getting more than one card in a day. But also keep in mind, it doesn't usually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=5840" target="_blank">01:37:20.500</a></span> | <span class="t">have a big impact on your credit score because once you have one Amex card,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=5843" target="_blank">01:37:23.700</a></span> | <span class="t">they typically only do soft pulls after that.

So keep that in mind. Again, that's only credit cards and not charge cards. So you can get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=5860" target="_blank">01:37:40.500</a></span> | <span class="t">as many charge cards as you want in that 90 day window. However, you typically can't get the same</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=5865" target="_blank">01:37:45.700</a></span> | <span class="t">card within a 90 day window. So if you applied for a business platinum card and got approved,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=5870" target="_blank">01:37:50.420</a></span> | <span class="t">and then you got one of those mailers and you wanted to do another one, you'd get declined</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=5874" target="_blank">01:37:54.100</a></span> | <span class="t">If you try to do that within 90 days.

So if you had a gold card, you could move it up to a platinum.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=5882" target="_blank">01:38:02.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes you'll even get an upgrade offer.

So you can move around, you can't upgrade within the first year. And I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=5896" target="_blank">01:38:16.740</a></span> | <span class="t">that's a rule across all cards and you can't cross over. So you can't go from membership rewards to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=5901" target="_blank">01:38:21.700</a></span> | <span class="t">cash back or to Hilton or to Marriott, but within each co brand you can. So you can change within the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=5907" target="_blank">01:38:27.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Delta cards, the Marriott cards within the Hilton cards, but you can't change within business and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=5912" target="_blank">01:38:32.180</a></span> | <span class="t">personal.

Awesome customer service.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=5918" target="_blank">01:38:38.820</a></span> | <span class="t">The lounge network is something that if you have a platinum or business platinum card is really unique.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=5923" target="_blank">01:38:43.380</a></span> | <span class="t">I guess also if you have a Delta card and you get access to Centurion lounges, we use those Amex</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=5928" target="_blank">01:38:48.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Centurion and the escape lounges pretty regularly, multiple times a year, along with that great customer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=5932" target="_blank">01:38:52.740</a></span> | <span class="t">service, really strong purchase and travel protection.

So that's awesome. A lot of people like the Amex fine hotels and resorts</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=5941" target="_blank">01:39:01.860</a></span> | <span class="t">program to get access to some perks at luxury hotels. I will say, I think they have 2200 hotels,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=5948" target="_blank">01:39:08.180</a></span> | <span class="t">the all the hacks upgrade program, I think has every one of those 2200 plus another 1800 for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=5953" target="_blank">01:39:13.220</a></span> | <span class="t">about 4000 total.

Amex offers, they could be so lucrative. I've gotten $2,000 of value from Amex offers and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=5963" target="_blank">01:39:23.380</a></span> | <span class="t">probably a few hundred in the last year. So pairing that with card pointers can be really great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=5968" target="_blank">01:39:28.820</a></span> | <span class="t">You also get a pop up.

Diversification versus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=5986" target="_blank">01:39:46.660</a></span> | <span class="t">other programs. Really solid, massive transfer partner list. But a lot of the unique programs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=5993" target="_blank">01:39:53.220</a></span> | <span class="t">that are only available to Amex are a little lacking, right? Up until three days from now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=5998" target="_blank">01:39:58.500</a></span> | <span class="t">or four days from now, they've had Hawaiian, which can backdoor into Alaska. That's going away. They have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=6003" target="_blank">01:40:03.940</a></span> | <span class="t">ANA, which is unique and has some really good value, but the transfer times to ANA are long and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=6009" target="_blank">01:40:09.060</a></span> | <span class="t">the ANA points expire.

I don't think I've ever had</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=6069" target="_blank">01:41:09.860</a></span> | <span class="t">an issue trying to use an Amex and have it not be accepted. But I just saw a post of someone talking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=6075" target="_blank">01:41:15.060</a></span> | <span class="t">about cards to use overseas in our membership.

But either way, it could be challenging</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=6083" target="_blank">01:41:23.940</a></span> | <span class="t">sometimes. And so finally, what I want to look at is the other least exciting thing about Amex is it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=6089" target="_blank">01:41:29.460</a></span> | <span class="t">hard to make a case for Amex as your only platform for points. So if you just want to earn points in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=6096" target="_blank">01:41:36.020</a></span> | <span class="t">one program, I feel like that's where Amex doesn't shine. So I looked at all the programs. And if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=6102" target="_blank">01:41:42.260</a></span> | <span class="t">look at Capital One, Wells Fargo City, if you have two cards with them, and by the way, those two cards</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=6108" target="_blank">01:41:48.340</a></span> | <span class="t">total an annual fee of $0 to $95 in all three of those programs, for the typical household</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=6114" target="_blank">01:41:54.900</a></span> | <span class="t">spending, and I use Bureau of Labor Statistics data to come up with this number, you're going to earn</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=6119" target="_blank">01:41:59.540</a></span> | <span class="t">2.26 to 2.33 points on all your spending. When I use my own spending, it's about 2.11 to 2.35x points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=6128" target="_blank">01:42:08.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's me.

I use the upper end of that spending data. So you're going to earn 2.26, 2.33. Let's round it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=6140" target="_blank">01:42:20.100</a></span> | <span class="t">off, say 2.3 points per dollar.

If you just focus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=6145" target="_blank">01:42:25.940</a></span> | <span class="t">on Amex, the two card combo that you'd probably want that will maximize your earnings on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=6151" target="_blank">01:42:31.140</a></span> | <span class="t">personal side is the Amex green and the Amex gold, you're going to have $400 of annual fees. So four</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=6156" target="_blank">01:42:36.820</a></span> | <span class="t">times the annual fees, and you're only going to end up with about 1.96x points.

So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=6170" target="_blank">01:42:50.100</a></span> | <span class="t">don't love that.

So while I do love the Amex platform, I don't think I could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=6201" target="_blank">01:43:21.060</a></span> | <span class="t">make an argument that is the only place you should be accruing points. Now, it's still better than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=6205" target="_blank">01:43:25.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Chase, right? Now, if you look at my favorite Chase combo, which is the Chase Sapphire Reserve</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=6210" target="_blank">01:43:30.420</a></span> | <span class="t">and the Freedom Unlimited, you've now got a $795 annual fee. And with the Bureau of Labor Statistics</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=6216" target="_blank">01:43:36.580</a></span> | <span class="t">data, you're earning 1.87 points on average. And with my data, you're earning 1.75.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=6222" target="_blank">01:43:42.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So Chase is the worst program to have just two cards at, if you're really trying to optimize.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=6228" target="_blank">01:43:48.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Obviously, you could go for the Chase Sapphire Preferred instead of the Chase Sapphire Reserve.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=6232" target="_blank">01:43:52.500</a></span> | <span class="t">You'd go an annual fee down to $95 for those two cards. And that would probably end you up at about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=6238" target="_blank">01:43:58.100</a></span> | <span class="t">1.8x points, which is still not as good as Amex, but lower than Capital One, Wells Fargo and City.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=6244" target="_blank">01:44:04.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So I still think the best option for everyday spending is to make sure you have a 2x everything card</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=6249" target="_blank">01:44:09.780</a></span> | <span class="t">to pair with all of your bonus spending. And the reason why Capital One, Wells Fargo and City are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=6255" target="_blank">01:44:15.060</a></span> | <span class="t">such better performers is that all three of them have a 2x points card. Some of them, you do have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=6259" target="_blank">01:44:19.620</a></span> | <span class="t">to have other cards to get 2x points. So the City Double Cash earns 2% back. But if you have the City</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=6265" target="_blank">01:44:25.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Premier, you can transfer those into points. Capital One, you could go venture venture X without having</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=6269" target="_blank">01:44:29.700</a></span> | <span class="t">to worry about another card and have a 2x everything card. So all that said, Amex signup bonuses are better</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=6276" target="_blank">01:44:36.580</a></span> | <span class="t">than all of the others. Where else can you get 200 to 250,000 points for a new card? And that's at least</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=6281" target="_blank">01:44:41.860</a></span> | <span class="t">on the business side. But right now on the personal side, 100 to 175,000 points on personal cards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=6287" target="_blank">01:44:47.940</a></span> | <span class="t">That is incredible. It's another reason to love Amex. And on top of the signup bonuses,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=6292" target="_blank">01:44:52.180</a></span> | <span class="t">when you start to layer in everything else, Amex offers, employee card offers, retention card</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=6297" target="_blank">01:44:57.220</a></span> | <span class="t">offers, you add it all together. There's a reason I have more Amex cards than anything else. Especially</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=6301" target="_blank">01:45:01.940</a></span> | <span class="t">if you're a business spending on categories like those 4x business categories, it can be really,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=6306" target="_blank">01:45:06.500</a></span> | <span class="t">really compelling. So I love Amex. I'm a huge fan. There's a reason we have all the cards. There's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=6311" target="_blank">01:45:11.460</a></span> | <span class="t">reason we have all the points. But I think that it's hard to make a case to just accumulate Amex points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=6317" target="_blank">01:45:17.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So I hope this episode was helpful. It was definitely a long one. We went through so much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhyLOs_5ewU&t=6322" target="_blank">01:45:22.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And that is it for this week.
