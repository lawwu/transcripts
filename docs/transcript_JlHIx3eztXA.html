I view it as if you need your grass cut, right? Like you don't say like, well, the lawnmower took care of it. Like you're the lawnmower, like you literally are taking the tool and cutting your grass. I think it's an assessment, ideally, you know, an unbiased assessment of your own skills, right?</p><p>Some people just have no business preparing their return. Even if it's on the simpler side, they will find a way to mess it up. Just not their thing, being timely. There's benefits to a preparer beyond the actual knowledge, right? A lot of times it's like peace of mind, it's just timeliness.</p><p>Like it's actually just going to get done. So assessing your own skills. And then at that point, I mean, TurboTax is great for whenever you've got clear tax documents that just need to be input, it will do it perfectly. I think when, when it's W-2 stuff, like TurboTax is great.</p><p>And if anything, they're better than hiring someone who doesn't care about their return as much as you care about your return, but once you start going into business or if you're taking any specific tax positions, I would just find someone that knows what they're doing.</p></div></div></body></html>
