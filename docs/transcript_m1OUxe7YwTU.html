There's not necessarily an advantage for studying physics at any of these two schools.</p><p>It's not like one's teaching you that gravity goes up and the other teaches you that gravity goes down. We have fallen into this trap of saying that these highly credentialed schools that cost 60 and 70 and 80 thousand dollars a year graduate the best kids. And I don't think that that's true either.</p><p>Today I just gave an offer to a guy that went to Virginia Tech and this kid seems awesome. To be honest, I think schools like that are better. I mean I think probably Virginia Tech is better than Harvard. They're way better. And the reason is because they're less infected with the whole woke DEI ideology that now pervades these like top schools.</p><p>So the students are more likely to learn something. They're not the smartest kids. They're not the hardest working kids. So we should stop saying top schools. These Ivy League schools are</p></div></div></body></html>
