Visit Swithop.com today. Hey, Radicals. This is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host. Not a normal episode of the show today. Just a couple of quick announcements for you.</p><p>I will be taking a few days off here, needing to take a break from the actual production of the show in order to get a few behind the scenes things on the show squared away. A few things that just been lagging and lagging on the website. Also, primarily, I need to be doing some work in setting out and negotiating and finding some relationships with some advertisers and some affiliates.</p><p>And what's happened is just with continuing to produce, produce, produce, I've been primarily focused on show production and I haven't been able to get some things squared away. So I'm feeling the pressure with baby coming soon, which we're very excited about, but I've got to get some things wrapped up before she is here.</p><p>So pulling the show for one week, taking a quick vacation here for a week. Also, just wanted to let you know in advance to expect after that, at least for the month of June here, expect the shows to be a little bit sporadic. I do have some interviews recorded.</p><p>I'm planning to release some more shows, but there's going to be a little bit more sporadic as I work through the monetization strategy for the show. The Patreon campaign has been an awesome success. I want to thank you guys, each and every one of you who is currently supporting the show.</p><p>There are over 190 patrons right now and we're almost to $2,000 a month of monthly support, which is awesome. If I were to compare that to many other shows, you all as an audience have been supporting me financially at a rate that is substantially higher than any other podcast or media enterprise that I'm aware of.</p><p>And that's pretty, pretty awesome. It's not at the amount where I can continue to do the show based purely on patron support. I need to go ahead and set up either, number one, my own products and services, or I need to bring on some advertising relationships onto the show, some sponsorship relationships, and/or I need to set up some affiliate relationships.</p><p>So I'm planning to do all three of those things, but working through the mix is important and being able to do it in a way that I believe is the best way long-term to do it is going to be important. So just working through those details and I need a few days to be able to square them away.</p><p>So that'll be coming on soon and I'll be announcing some of those things as time comes on with a more formal discussion of what's worked and what hasn't done just today. This is just a quick announcement. Don't be scared if you don't see a show for a little bit.</p><p>It'll be back soon. Also, just a couple of requests for you guys. If you feel – if you're in a situation where – if you have a product or service that you really love and that you think would be a good fit for the Radical Personal Finance community and would be valuable both for the audience and for the person or company behind the product or service, please let me know.</p><p>Email me, joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com. I've made a list of companies and products that I really feel have a lot of value that I feel strongly about being able to endorse wholeheartedly, and that's my standard is in bringing on advertisers and affiliates and things like that. It's important to me to be able to give a wholehearted endorsement, and I need to do that while I'm creating my own products.</p><p>That's just more time – takes more time. So I'm doing all of the above. But if you have a product or service that you feel strongly about, please let me know. And if I'm familiar with it, it will help me to be able to jog my memory and say, "Oh, you know what?</p><p>That would be a really great fit." I should reach out to them and negotiate a business relationship with them to advertise and present their information to you. Or it might just jog my memory into something I can research and see if I can endorse them as well. But I would love to hear that from you, Joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com.</p><p>It doesn't necessarily have to be related to something specifically related to finance. It can also be something else as well. So feel free to recommend those things. I do plan to be creating a number of products and services of my own that I can sell directly to you. I'm working on a book right now that I believe will be helpful.</p><p>It's something that I've never seen done that I believe will be helpful and valuable. And I'm also going to be putting together a number of information products that I think will be helpful as well. So that will be key as well. Those just take time to develop. So I've got a good bit of focus right now with it being the beginning of June.</p><p>And there are a number of things that are just all coming together, which is why I'm taking a little bit of time just to pull back and refocus, make a new plan. Make sure that I check my plan and continue forward. I'm coming up on the one-year anniversary of launching Radical Personal Finance full-time, which is awesome.</p><p>I'm coming up on the birth of our baby girl, which is super exciting. And coming up, I just discussed with the company that I do contract work for. And at the end of July, I will be terminating my contract there. They no longer have need of my services, and it will work out well.</p><p>But it gives me a major need to focus and say, "OK, I need to go ahead and square away some of the revenue models behind Radical Personal Finance now that that safety net is going away." And my 30th birthday is next week. The 18th of June is going to be my 30th birthday.</p><p>So that's pretty exciting as well. And so all these things, I just need a few days away. A couple of quick affiliate things. Number one, FinCon. I've mentioned on the show – I can't remember if I've mentioned that I'm speaking there, but if you would like to come to the FinCon Expo, it will be in Charlotte, North Carolina, this year, September 17 to September 20, 2015.</p><p>There are a bunch of great speakers there. Carl Richards from Behavior Gap is speaking. Tess Vigeland from NPR or formerly NPR. There are a bunch of great speakers. Let's see, internet people. Pat Flynn is speaking. I'm speaking. I'll be speaking on podcasting. So if you'd like to come to that event, it's a really great event.</p><p>It's in Charlotte, North Carolina. If you would like to come, please buy your ticket with my affiliate link. I have an affiliate link as a speaker. It can be found at RadicalPersonalFinance.com/FinCon, RadicalPersonalFinance.com/Fin for financial, F-I-N, FinCon, C-O-N for conference. You can find all the details of the show at FinConExpo.com, but please book through the link found at RadicalPersonalFinance.com/FinCon in order to use my affiliate code, and I get paid a commission on the sale of that ticket.</p><p>That would be helpful if you would like to come. I will be doing a meetup with a listener meetup. That's one of the things that I'm going to be squaring away over the next few days is planning that out, planning my schedule for that so I'm not caught behind when I get there and kind of organizing something spur of the moment.</p><p>So please do that. Also, I will be speaking at the XY Planning Conference seminar conference that's immediately before FinCon. It's the two days right before FinCon at the same hotel there in Charlotte, North Carolina. I'll be presenting a session, continuing education, CFP continuing education session on investing. So I'm finalizing and squaring away that topic right now.</p><p>So I think those are the announcements I wanted to make. Just wanted to let you know I'm still fine. Everything is good. Even though the show is going to be away for a few days, everything is fine. I just need a quick little break to get caught up on business stuff and kind of readjust here.</p><p>At some point, I should take a vacation. Last comment, if you have thought about becoming a patron of the show, it would be extremely valuable to me if you would do so. I want to thank each and every one of you who has done it and just mention to you that if you've been thinking about it, it would be extremely helpful.</p><p>It's super important as I work on my own personal plans and as I'm closing down this back-end consulting work that I've been doing, which has been the primary means of support for my family, it's super helpful to know the numbers that are coming in from Patreon and as I work in the additional revenue models.</p><p>If you can't afford it, I understand and I want you to feel completely relaxed with that. If I haven't been able to provide enough content where it's even valuable, don't even consider it. But if the content on Radical Personal Finance has been helpful to you, even if it's had any kind of measurable financial impact for you and your life, even a buck a month is super helpful.</p><p>Just the fact that there are 191 paying customers who voluntarily have chosen to contribute money for content that is otherwise free is a huge sign of support. It's also even a huge sign of support for advertisers and things like that. When I can prove to people that a large percentage of my audience actually supports the show voluntarily, that has a lot of weight.</p><p>So if you thought about doing that, now would be a great time. Go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron and sign up to support the show. I will be back very soon. Cheers, y'all. The LA Kings Holiday Pack is back! The perfect gift for the hockey fan and your life.
