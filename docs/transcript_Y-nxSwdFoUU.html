And when I was researching this a long time ago, I came across a study in the University of Haifa in Israel that found that under the right circumstances, adults are better language learners than children. And that sounds very counterintuitive because all the evidence we see out there is what children are clearly learning languages more than adults are.</p><p>And that is because it's not under the right circumstances for those adults. The adults are taking dusty old grammar books. The adults are going to group classes where they're kind of zipping it and letting a teacher talk at them. The adults are not truly living through the language. The adults don't have any friends in the language.</p><p>They're not playing games in the language like a child does. And the child has a better language learning approach. It's not that they are better at language learning.</p></div></div></body></html>
