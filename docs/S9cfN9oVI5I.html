Now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.960</a></span> | <span class="t">what I can do with the rank operator is to put blinders on this function. So right now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=392" target="_blank">00:06:32.120</a></span> | <span class="t">it's receiving as its argument the entire array A. When I say rank two, the only thing that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.640</a></span> | <span class="t">will ever see is arrays of rank two, even if the actual rank of the argument is higher. So what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=408" target="_blank">00:06:48.280</a></span> | <span class="t">rank will do is saying, oh, this function is only allowed to see arrays of rank two. Let me show it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=413" target="_blank">00:06:53.720</a></span> | <span class="t">this array of rank two. And when it's done processing that, let me show it this array.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=419" target="_blank">00:06:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I'll collect together its results from those two applications into a larger result.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=425" target="_blank">00:07:05.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, remember, plus slash sums the rows. So when it sees this row, an array, it sums this row,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=433" target="_blank">00:07:13.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and it sums this row, and it sums this row. Next time around, it sums this, and this, and this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=439" target="_blank">00:07:19.560</a></span> | <span class="t">which means the result is going to be entirely identical to what we had before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=444" target="_blank">00:07:24.040</a></span> | <span class="t">What's actually happening is that it's seeing less at a time, but that doesn't matter. The</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=453" target="_blank">00:07:33.080</a></span> | <span class="t">result is the same. And if we do rank one, it is only allowed to ever see one row.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=459" target="_blank">00:07:39.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So it will sum this, and then rank will let us sum this, and so on, and we get the same result.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=463" target="_blank">00:07:43.960</a></span> | <span class="t">When you set the rank zero, then ranks knows, okay, this function is only ever allowed to see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=472" target="_blank">00:07:52.040</a></span> | <span class="t">arrays of rank zero, that is single elements. So it will tell it, okay, sum one, then sum two,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=478" target="_blank">00:07:58.280</a></span> | <span class="t">which is why that gives us our array unmodified. The difference with plus slash</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=489" target="_blank">00:08:09.400</a></span> | <span class="t">is plus slash does the, sorry, plus slash bar is that it looks at the whole array and treats it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=498" target="_blank">00:08:18.360</a></span> | <span class="t">as a whole array. So it takes the entire first layer and adds it to the entire second layer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=503" target="_blank">00:08:23.160</a></span> | <span class="t">like that. Now, if you restrict the rank to rank two, it cannot see the entire array. The</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=513" target="_blank">00:08:33.880</a></span> | <span class="t">only thing you can see is this matrix because rank is restricting its vision. So now it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=520" target="_blank">00:08:40.120</a></span> | <span class="t">going to instead, the leading axis now is down here along the row. So it's going to add this row</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=526" target="_blank">00:08:46.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to this row, to this row, giving a result with four elements like that, which is why we get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=534" target="_blank">00:08:54.360</a></span> | <span class="t">two times four elements. If I tell it rank one, then it will only ever be able to see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=541" target="_blank">00:09:01.880</a></span> | <span class="t">one row at a time. So it will sum each row and that's equivalent to plus slash.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=547" target="_blank">00:09:07.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So in general, when you have two symbols that are the same, but one has a bar on it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=554" target="_blank">00:09:14.440</a></span> | <span class="t">then if you give the one with a bar, rank one, that's the same thing as removing the bar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=561" target="_blank">00:09:21.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And so is that why like you often see more experienced APL programmers kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=569" target="_blank">00:09:29.320</a></span> | <span class="t">using the bar version kind of by default, because it's like more flexible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=573" target="_blank">00:09:33.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Exactly. So now, if we try to use a function that computes the average,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=582" target="_blank">00:09:42.840</a></span> | <span class="t">let's do that again. And here's a function that computes the average.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=592" target="_blank">00:09:52.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm sorry, tell you, you just learned telling something like that. Now, if I try to apply this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=599" target="_blank">00:09:59.560</a></span> | <span class="t">on a table instead on the matrix, so we can use this one. Then obviously the average in each row</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=613" target="_blank">00:10:13.400</a></span> | <span class="t">should be two and five. Well, what's actually happening is that we get something that makes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=619" target="_blank">00:10:19.480</a></span> | <span class="t">no sense at all. Why is that? Because tell it counts how many major cells there are,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=626" target="_blank">00:10:26.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that is along the first axis. So it says there are two, but plus slash is summing along the rows.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=633" target="_blank">00:10:33.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So we are summing three numbers and dividing by two, that is not an average.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=637" target="_blank">00:10:37.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So experienced APL, they will use slash bar instead. This sums along the leading axis,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=644" target="_blank">00:10:44.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and this counts along the leading axis, and this will give me one average per column.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=649" target="_blank">00:10:49.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So the average of one and four is two and a half, average of two and five is three and a half.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=654" target="_blank">00:10:54.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Yep. That's why the experienced APLs will use first axis functions, because then they can always say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=663" target="_blank">00:11:03.560</a></span> | <span class="t">okay, if I want the average over the rows, I'll restrict the view of this function to the rows</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=673" target="_blank">00:11:13.640</a></span> | <span class="t">of this array. And now I get two and five. And I couldn't have done that if I had defined my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=680" target="_blank">00:11:20.440</a></span> | <span class="t">function. I couldn't, it wouldn't be as flexible if I had defined my function in terms of last axis,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=685" target="_blank">00:11:25.560</a></span> | <span class="t">only by defining it in terms of first axis, I'm able to narrow down this vision to any lower level.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=691" target="_blank">00:11:31.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Is a way to think of that mnemonic with the slash bar is that like the bar is horizontal,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=700" target="_blank">00:11:40.840</a></span> | <span class="t">so it deals with rows? Is that like a... Yeah, that's how I think of it. At least it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=705" target="_blank">00:11:45.880</a></span> | <span class="t">goes down the rows instead of going along the columns. And you have the same thing with,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=713" target="_blank">00:11:53.160</a></span> | <span class="t">this is reverse, horizontal reverse, and this meaning last axis reverse, and this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=720" target="_blank">00:12:00.440</a></span> | <span class="t">reversing it over the horizontal axis, or rotating over the horizontal axis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=725" target="_blank">00:12:05.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Or flip, flipping? Yeah, either flipping or...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=729" target="_blank">00:12:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Horizontally, or flipping vertically. Yeah, exactly. So this shows the bar is transposed,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=735" target="_blank">00:12:15.720</a></span> | <span class="t">isn't it? Yes, the diagonal is transposed because it's flipping over the diagonal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=739" target="_blank">00:12:19.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Wow, that's so awesome.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=741" target="_blank">00:12:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the problem we had with, you're trying to do this thing or something like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=751" target="_blank">00:12:31.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Or we can take some numbers that makes it a little bit easier to understand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=758" target="_blank">00:12:38.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So, plus and all the arithmetic functions are so-called scalar functions. They actually have an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=765" target="_blank">00:12:45.960</a></span> | <span class="t">implied rank zero, always. Meaning they're always so narrow-minded that they only look at individual</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=775" target="_blank">00:12:55.720</a></span> | <span class="t">elements and never consider the whole array. And there's nothing the rank operator can do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=781" target="_blank">00:13:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to change that. So as opposed to axis, which is an ad hoc syntax that actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=787" target="_blank">00:13:07.400</a></span> | <span class="t">looks at what function did you give it and does something special for it, the rank operator is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=792" target="_blank">00:13:12.120</a></span> | <span class="t">entirely general purpose. It has no idea about which function it's applying.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=797" target="_blank">00:13:17.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I see. So equals bar could be used to behave like equals, but...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=801" target="_blank">00:13:21.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Exactly. So if we do this, now we're using match that only is allowed to look at scalars at a time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=809" target="_blank">00:13:29.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So it looks at three and three. It looks at four and looks at five as pairs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=815" target="_blank">00:13:35.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we can use that to match anything. So match is the more general purpose function</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=822" target="_blank">00:13:42.120</a></span> | <span class="t">than equal, but equal is a very common construct. So that we have a separate function for that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=828" target="_blank">00:13:48.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And a good way to get a view of things in general, if you don't know what's going on in an expression,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=835" target="_blank">00:13:55.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I think you did see this phrase once. It prints things. So here's a really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=843" target="_blank">00:14:03.800</a></span> | <span class="t">useful debugging trick. If I have a function, I don't know exactly what's going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=848" target="_blank">00:14:08.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll wrap it in a division and I'll put in alpha and omega. And this is a new statement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=856" target="_blank">00:14:16.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know if you've seen that. And then I'll apply the function. So let's say, for example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=862" target="_blank">00:14:22.760</a></span> | <span class="t">that I'm using equal. So the function will return the same result as the primitive function,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=870" target="_blank">00:14:30.040</a></span> | <span class="t">but it's wrapped in such a way that it prints the arguments first.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=874" target="_blank">00:14:34.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So now if we say three, four, and three, five, we can see that the two should probably turn boxing on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=884" target="_blank">00:14:44.520</a></span> | <span class="t">We don't actually need the max style. But oops, that didn't. Oh, of course.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=894" target="_blank">00:14:54.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I have to specify that even when functions are printing, I want it to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=900" target="_blank">00:15:00.040</a></span> | <span class="t">boxed. So what equal is seeing is three, four, and also three, five. But it does its thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=907" target="_blank">00:15:07.960</a></span> | <span class="t">element by element. Now, if I apply the rank operator, it will print twice. It'll be called</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=915" target="_blank">00:15:15.720</a></span> | <span class="t">three, three, and four, five. So this is a good way to see it. And you have already gone so advanced</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=921" target="_blank">00:15:21.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that you created your own operators. So we can actually create a trace operator.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=928" target="_blank">00:15:28.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And it will print the arguments. And then it will apply the function to the arguments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=938" target="_blank">00:15:38.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So now we can say three, four, equal TC, three, five. It prints that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=946" target="_blank">00:15:46.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And we can do it with rank zero. It prints it like this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=956" target="_blank">00:15:56.920</a></span> | <span class="t">We can even make it fancier and put labels inside and saying alpha is this, and omega is this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=961" target="_blank">00:16:01.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and so on. You do need a different version for a monadic, though, because there would be a value</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=968" target="_blank">00:16:08.040</a></span> | <span class="t">error on the alpha. So there's a trick that you haven't learned yet, which is to type this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=974" target="_blank">00:16:14.840</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a special syntax in the defin. It means--</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=979" target="_blank">00:16:19.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I've seen that. It means apply. It means make that-- if you haven't passed an alpha,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=983" target="_blank">00:16:23.640</a></span> | <span class="t">then that's default. It's just default left argument. So the default left argument-- this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=986" target="_blank">00:16:26.920</a></span> | <span class="t">is a funny default left argument, because the default left argument is a function,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=991" target="_blank">00:16:31.240</a></span> | <span class="t">which otherwise you can't pass in. But it's a function which is a no-op. It's a identity</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=997" target="_blank">00:16:37.400</a></span> | <span class="t">function. And so here, if alpha is an identity function, then we just print omega. And over here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1004" target="_blank">00:16:44.600</a></span> | <span class="t">if alpha is an identity function, we apply alpha-alpha monadically. And then we apply</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1009" target="_blank">00:16:49.640</a></span> | <span class="t">identity function to it, which doesn't do anything. So this is a general purpose TC.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1013" target="_blank">00:16:53.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So now I can take A we had before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1016" target="_blank">00:16:56.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Sorry, just to clarify, Adam. Is that setting alpha-- it's not setting alpha to the identity</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1025" target="_blank">00:17:05.240</a></span> | <span class="t">function, right? It's setting alpha to the result of the identity function.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1028" target="_blank">00:17:08.120</a></span> | <span class="t">No, it makes alpha B the identity function.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1031" target="_blank">00:17:11.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, OK, because I thought--</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1033" target="_blank">00:17:13.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Because there's no argument to it. So it's just a function assignment. It's a tested function.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1037" target="_blank">00:17:17.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

That makes perfect sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1041" target="_blank">00:17:21.240</a></span> | <span class="t">It would be the same thing as writing this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1043" target="_blank">00:17:23.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, yeah, I get it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1044" target="_blank">00:17:24.360</a></span> | <span class="t">OK, so we don't have to change that. So now, if we look at what plus slash is seeing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1051" target="_blank">00:17:31.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and that was our problem from the beginning. So here, we can see that it's seeing the entire array.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1058" target="_blank">00:17:38.120</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a little bit hard to read, but here's our result. And this is the printout of the arguments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1064" target="_blank">00:17:44.200</a></span> | <span class="t">We can improve TC a little bit and say alpha here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1070" target="_blank">00:17:50.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, yes, of course, that's not going to work. And alpha omega.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1092" target="_blank">00:18:12.760</a></span> | <span class="t">This will work. OK, so there's only an omega in this case.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1104" target="_blank">00:18:24.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's seeing the entire array, and it's summing its rows.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1110" target="_blank">00:18:30.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And when we try to apply this rank 2, then we see it twice. But it's, again, being applied to this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1117" target="_blank">00:18:37.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It's exactly like applying plus slash to this array, summing its rows.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1122" target="_blank">00:18:42.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so on. So this is a really useful operator. You can modify it to your heart's content.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1130" target="_blank">00:18:50.440</a></span> | <span class="t">You can make it do whatever you want.

So I think, I mean, I can take questions, but I think it should be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1139" target="_blank">00:18:59.080</a></span> | <span class="t">more clear now what the rank operator does. It's just blinders. That's all it does.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1144" target="_blank">00:19:04.120</a></span> | <span class="t">This was really helpful.

The outer product is comparing all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1171" target="_blank">00:19:31.800</a></span> | <span class="t">elements on one side to all the elements on the other side, all the different combinations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1176" target="_blank">00:19:36.920</a></span> | <span class="t">We can write this just with equal and rank. Yeah, that's what we did yesterday.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1181" target="_blank">00:19:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So again, this is every element, zero on the left.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1189" target="_blank">00:19:49.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Rank zero on the left gets compared to every element on the right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1193" target="_blank">00:19:53.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So I know you did this, but there's a point here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1197" target="_blank">00:19:57.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So it gives us the same result. But what is equal actually seeing?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1203" target="_blank">00:20:03.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Outer product applies between all combinations of left and right elements.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1207" target="_blank">00:20:07.720</a></span> | <span class="t">That's not what's happening here.

Scalar on the left,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1225" target="_blank">00:20:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">vector on the right. If we instead do dot equal trace like this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1234" target="_blank">00:20:34.440</a></span> | <span class="t">you can see that it's being called individually on every pair.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1239" target="_blank">00:20:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the full way of behaving like the outer product is to say, I want equal to only ever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1253" target="_blank">00:20:53.480</a></span> | <span class="t">see arguments of rank zero on one side and zero on the other side. And you're allowed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1258" target="_blank">00:20:58.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to omit one if they're the same. And that function, which only looks at rank zero things,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1265" target="_blank">00:21:05.480</a></span> | <span class="t">should be applied between scalars on the left and vectors on the right. So I'm using rank twice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1272" target="_blank">00:21:12.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, wow. Hang on. Okay. I want you to understand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1275" target="_blank">00:21:15.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So everything banks for the left. Okay, we read left to right when we do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1279" target="_blank">00:21:19.320</a></span> | <span class="t">operators. Yeah. Or you could say the operators have a long left scope. So this operator</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1284" target="_blank">00:21:24.760</a></span> | <span class="t">takes the entire thing here, operator phrase on the left, a function phrase on the left.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1288" target="_blank">00:21:28.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is saying this function can only ever see scalars. And with that, apply it between scalars</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1296" target="_blank">00:21:36.760</a></span> | <span class="t">on the left and vectors on the right. Now, I don't get it. So if you're saying to apply it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1302" target="_blank">00:21:42.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to vectors on the right, but you previously said it only, you can never apply the scalars.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1307" target="_blank">00:21:47.240</a></span> | <span class="t">What does that? Yeah. So it's not, remember, um, rank is not modifying the function.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1312" target="_blank">00:21:52.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Rank is calling the function one or more times as necessary, such that the function will have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1320" target="_blank">00:22:00.040</a></span> | <span class="t">restricted view. Yes. So this function over here will be called with left arguments as scalars and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1327" target="_blank">00:22:07.880</a></span> | <span class="t">right arguments as vectors. We can see that by putting in CC. Oh, right. However, this function</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1335" target="_blank">00:22:15.800</a></span> | <span class="t">itself is the derived function. It is not a normal equal. It's an equal. It's, it's a function that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1342" target="_blank">00:22:22.840</a></span> | <span class="t">uses equal, but only ever lets equal experience a scalar on the left and the scalar on the right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1348" target="_blank">00:22:28.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And how do we know that? Well, we can look at with TC. So now we can see that this equal is being</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1355" target="_blank">00:22:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">called like that one element at a time on the left and on the right. We could also put in a double</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1359" target="_blank">00:22:39.640</a></span> | <span class="t">TC, but it will be a very verbose and also when, yeah. So, so we can see first to go up all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1368" target="_blank">00:22:48.440</a></span> | <span class="t">way here. So we say that the outer TC reported, I'm calling my operand with a scalar and a vector</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1374" target="_blank">00:22:54.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and the inner TC, the left one saying, I'm seeing, I'm calling my operand with a scalar and a scalar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1384" target="_blank">00:23:04.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So actually in some ways, it makes sense to think about that composition train right to left</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1393" target="_blank">00:23:13.320</a></span> | <span class="t">in the sense that the right-hand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1397" target="_blank">00:23:17.400</a></span> | <span class="t">diuresis is taking the whole left-hand function. So the kind of the implied loop is that left-hand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1413" target="_blank">00:23:33.080</a></span> | <span class="t">side is kind of the inner of the applied loop in a sense. Yes. And this is the governor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1417" target="_blank">00:23:37.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Or do you read it right to left until you hit the operator and then you jump to the far left and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1425" target="_blank">00:23:45.400</a></span> | <span class="t">read that?

And then when you have equal binding strength, then operators go from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1478" target="_blank">00:24:38.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the left stronger. So they have a long left scope and operators left upper-end will be as far to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1485" target="_blank">00:24:45.560</a></span> | <span class="t">left as it can possibly reach without switching type.

Well, here we have an operator, a magnetic operator. It can't be just that because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1504" target="_blank">00:25:04.920</a></span> | <span class="t">it can't take a magnetic operator as upper-end.

Maybe this is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1508" target="_blank">00:25:08.680</a></span> | <span class="t">upper-end of TC. Oh, further left. No, there's a diatic operator. It's going to grab the zero</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=1514" target="_blank">00:25:14.680</a></span> | <span class="t">from TC and it takes its left upper-end.

Use Boolean masks as much as you can. And that is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2178" target="_blank">00:36:18.440</a></span> | <span class="t">because again, the RAM is the issue.

So in other words, instead of conditionals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2186" target="_blank">00:36:26.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, not just instead of conditionals, but instead of integers, if you can,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2191" target="_blank">00:36:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">instead of using indices and things, then you should use a mask for the whole thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2195" target="_blank">00:36:35.160</a></span> | <span class="t">The reason for that is and store data as Boolean instead of... So I just want to make sure I've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2201" target="_blank">00:36:41.880</a></span> | <span class="t">done the same wavelength. So as you're saying, instead of like having an array that says like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2206" target="_blank">00:36:46.040</a></span> | <span class="t">get indices two, three, and five, you would have a mask array of zeros in which items two,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2212" target="_blank">00:36:52.040</a></span> | <span class="t">three, and five have a one in that location. Exactly. And then let's say, for example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2218" target="_blank">00:36:58.280</a></span> | <span class="t">you need to combine two conditions.

And then by one condition, you have another condition for which elements four and five</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2236" target="_blank">00:37:16.360</a></span> | <span class="t">hold the condition. So you could do the intersection of the two sets. I'm multiplying them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2241" target="_blank">00:37:21.560</a></span> | <span class="t">To get the indices. Well, they're just numbers, right? They're just the intersection. So you do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2247" target="_blank">00:37:27.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the intersection of them as sets. And then those are the ones where the condition holds for both.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2252" target="_blank">00:37:32.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you could index things. However, if you had them as Boolean masks instead,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2256" target="_blank">00:37:36.600</a></span> | <span class="t">so it would be whatever, zero, one, zero, one, something like that, and one of them and so on,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2262" target="_blank">00:37:42.520</a></span> | <span class="t">one of them and so on, then you can just do an end, the Boolean end. And that gives you a new mask</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2267" target="_blank">00:37:47.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and doing a Boolean and operation on binary data in the processor is enormously much faster than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2274" target="_blank">00:37:54.840</a></span> | <span class="t">doing a set intersection. That's what I meant about multiply. So you could, okay. Yes. Exactly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2280" target="_blank">00:38:00.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there's another benefit of this is the API will aggressively squeeze arrays</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2288" target="_blank">00:38:08.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and Boolean arrays are stored as one bit Booleans.

That means that you can store eight</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2296" target="_blank">00:38:16.440</a></span> | <span class="t">elements in a single byte. Wait, how does that work? Because it's not like typed per se. So if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2303" target="_blank">00:38:23.080</a></span> | <span class="t">it would just notice that the highest is one and the lowest is zero.

Yes. Yes. And then, but that means</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2315" target="_blank">00:38:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">since the processor is waiting for the data and we're able to switch to an eighth of the data size,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2321" target="_blank">00:38:41.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that means that the transfer time, which is the important time is going to be an eighth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2326" target="_blank">00:38:46.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And that gives you enormous speed ups.

And what was the first thing I said before?

If you try to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2555" target="_blank">00:42:35.720</a></span> | <span class="t">use plus each, it will not actually loop because it knows how to just circuit that and just do it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2562" target="_blank">00:42:42.040</a></span> | <span class="t">directly. But what's happening with each is, you think of the matrix, they want to loop over each</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2572" target="_blank">00:42:52.040</a></span> | <span class="t">row, but really what each is, is very, very simple. So if you have F each, that's the same thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2580" target="_blank">00:43:00.120</a></span> | <span class="t">as, you know, now that you've learned enough of these compositional operators,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2585" target="_blank">00:43:05.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you learn the top. It's the enclose, which I don't remember.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2589" target="_blank">00:43:09.480</a></span> | <span class="t">We haven't done enclose, but you can do quickly what it is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2592" target="_blank">00:43:12.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, it's basically just wrapping an array up as a single element, as a scaler.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2596" target="_blank">00:43:16.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's adding a leading act. Oh, it's not adding a leading act.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2599" target="_blank">00:43:19.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Not adding an actually creating a scaler. It's creating a pointer to it. You can think of it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2604" target="_blank">00:43:24.680</a></span> | <span class="t">like that. What type is that? Is that some new type we haven't learned yet? Like it's literally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2609" target="_blank">00:43:29.160</a></span> | <span class="t">an enclosed item. Well, it's not numeric scaler. It's not a, and it's not a scaler.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2619" target="_blank">00:43:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a pointer type reference, but it doesn't, it's not a reference. No. Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2624" target="_blank">00:43:44.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Because APL is passed by value.

And that's pretty much how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2635" target="_blank">00:43:55.400</a></span> | <span class="t">you can think of it, but you need some enclosure. It's a scaler. And so what it is, is enclose</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2644" target="_blank">00:44:04.440</a></span> | <span class="t">a top F over disclose, and disclose exactly the opposite. This means follow the pointer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2653" target="_blank">00:44:13.800</a></span> | <span class="t">go, go get one element and open it up. Rank zero.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2659" target="_blank">00:44:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm just trying to remember. So the jot, diuresis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2665" target="_blank">00:44:25.640</a></span> | <span class="t">This is pre-freses, both arguments. Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2670" target="_blank">00:44:30.520</a></span> | <span class="t">But if there's only one argument, remember, then it's the same thing as on the top.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2673" target="_blank">00:44:33.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I do remember.

So this means actually pre-process all arguments,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2680" target="_blank">00:44:40.920</a></span> | <span class="t">whether there's one or two, we just pre-process them with this close.

You've got, oh, no, you don't have a fork. These are operators, not functions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2692" target="_blank">00:44:52.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So this is, so here you've got function, operator, function, operator, function, operator,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2699" target="_blank">00:44:59.720</a></span> | <span class="t">array. Okay. So this whole thing is monadic because there's a thing only on the right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2704" target="_blank">00:45:04.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, wait, what, what are you saying? This is not, this whole thing is one giant function.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2712" target="_blank">00:45:12.680</a></span> | <span class="t">The function is ambivalent.

I thought the zero on the right hands. Oh, no, the zero is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2723" target="_blank">00:45:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">right hand side of the operator. Yeah. Yeah. So this says, so what it's saying is on every</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2729" target="_blank">00:45:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">scalar element and loop as much as necessary to address scalar elements. Okay. This is fine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2734" target="_blank">00:45:34.600</a></span> | <span class="t">On both, on both sides, not mine. This is rank. Oh, okay. Yes, of course. That's rank. So this says</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2741" target="_blank">00:45:41.720</a></span> | <span class="t">on scalars. So we already, we already dug. The first thing we do is dig all the way down to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2747" target="_blank">00:45:47.640</a></span> | <span class="t">scalars. That means there's nothing you can do to each to make it apply to rows. It's already</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2755" target="_blank">00:45:55.720</a></span> | <span class="t">impossible. It's like, it's like equal or plus it's already down at the scalar level on the scalars.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2761" target="_blank">00:46:01.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Sorry. So it never sees the row. Yeah. It never sees a row. It never sees any,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2768" target="_blank">00:46:08.280</a></span> | <span class="t">F will never see anything that comes from more than a single element. So on the single elements.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2773" target="_blank">00:46:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. And remember this zero actually means zero, zero, zero, because it, what it means is zero,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2779" target="_blank">00:46:19.160</a></span> | <span class="t">it's ranked zero monadically, it's ranked zero and left and this ranks zero, right. So it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2783" target="_blank">00:46:23.560</a></span> | <span class="t">always ranked zero. Then on those elements, open them up. If they are nested, if they're not nested,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2791" target="_blank">00:46:31.720</a></span> | <span class="t">like just a simple array, then nothing happens. Apply F and package the results back into the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2799" target="_blank">00:46:39.320</a></span> | <span class="t">box. Oh yeah. Because the, um, when you've got multiple composition, it goes right to left.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2808" target="_blank">00:46:48.920</a></span> | <span class="t">This, yeah, you could, you could, the binding goes like that. So we're saying, so this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2814" target="_blank">00:46:54.200</a></span> | <span class="t">this is F post processed by enclosing the result and pre-processed by disclosing the result.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2822" target="_blank">00:47:02.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, okay. So we can show you have actually used nested arrays that have been implied</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2829" target="_blank">00:47:09.320</a></span> | <span class="t">in close already. So, and what we can say as an example, ABC, DF, this is a nested array.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2838" target="_blank">00:47:18.520</a></span> | <span class="t">This is exactly the same thing as the enclose of ABC concatenated with the enclose of DF.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2846" target="_blank">00:47:26.520</a></span> | <span class="t">The stranding syntax is just a nicety. It's in tactic sugar. It means this. Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2853" target="_blank">00:47:33.080</a></span> | <span class="t">It just enclose all the elements that are being stranded together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2856" target="_blank">00:47:36.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So, so conceptually, these are, well, no, they're really, they're, they're scalars</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2864" target="_blank">00:47:44.040</a></span> | <span class="t">because every vector consists of scalars and every matrix consists of rows that have scalars</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2869" target="_blank">00:47:49.320</a></span> | <span class="t">in them, elements in them. And so this is an, and maybe we should turn boxing up to max now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2875" target="_blank">00:47:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Why is that not just an array of arrays where the first array is ABC and the second array is DF?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2883" target="_blank">00:48:03.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, it is. Okay. So why do you need that enclose idea?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2887" target="_blank">00:48:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because if I didn't have enclose here, then we would just be concatenating together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2894" target="_blank">00:48:14.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So we need to say each, each three element vector lives in its own little scalar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2901" target="_blank">00:48:21.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so these are individual scalars. If we look at the, at the shape of this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2908" target="_blank">00:48:28.040</a></span> | <span class="t">it's the empty vector. It's a scalar. Yep. If you look at the depth of it, it's depth two.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2913" target="_blank">00:48:33.640</a></span> | <span class="t">There's an outer array, which is a scalar and there's an inner array, which is a vector.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2918" target="_blank">00:48:38.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So the two levels. Yep. And so this is what we have. This is exactly the same thing as ABC, DF.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2928" target="_blank">00:48:48.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And now it's easier to understand when I do reverse each on these, what was actually happening here is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2941" target="_blank">00:49:01.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I started off by applying on, so you can make our little, we can write this TC each.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2950" target="_blank">00:49:10.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So we can see that TC is first seeing ABC, then seeing DF. Ah, well done. So if TC is seeing ABC,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2959" target="_blank">00:49:19.720</a></span> | <span class="t">then firstly, well, if reverse is seeing ABC, that means it was only applied to the first element.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2969" target="_blank">00:49:29.800</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the rank zero, but it wasn't, it didn't see the enclosure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2973" target="_blank">00:49:33.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have disclosed it. We've opened it up. Hmm. And what did that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2980" target="_blank">00:49:40.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, because remember the definition of, of each. So in this case, it's the enclosing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=2989" target="_blank">00:49:49.400</a></span> | <span class="t">oops, enclosing a top, the disclosing rank zero. Oh, this is what each means. That's the definition</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=3003" target="_blank">00:50:03.400</a></span> | <span class="t">of each. If we didn't do the disclosing, if you just do this right, reverse running zero,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=3013" target="_blank">00:50:13.400</a></span> | <span class="t">then we are reversing each scalar, but reversing a scalar doesn't do anything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=3017" target="_blank">00:50:17.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Hmm. If we only preprocessed it by opening it up, then we would get the matrix because we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=3028" target="_blank">00:50:28.120</a></span> | <span class="t">having the results from this or is a vector. So two vectors in an array makes a matrix.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=3034" target="_blank">00:50:34.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So to stick them back into the boxes where they came from, we post process</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=3042" target="_blank">00:50:42.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the result of reverse, and this is a definition of each. And that's why you cannot use a function</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=3049" target="_blank">00:50:49.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that has an each after it to access entire rows of a matrix. It's just not possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=3054" target="_blank">00:50:54.840</a></span> | <span class="t">However, if we take three, four, reshape by Yota and Yota 12, and we want to reverse each row.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=3067" target="_blank">00:51:07.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, now you can use rank. Firstly, this function anyway is rank one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=3074" target="_blank">00:51:14.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Remember, if this function is the leading axis one, then the corresponding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=3082" target="_blank">00:51:22.280</a></span> | <span class="t">function is the same thing rank one. So this reverses the first axis, and this reverses</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=3092" target="_blank">00:51:32.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the last axis. It flips it horizontally. And if we use the first axis one with rank one,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=3101" target="_blank">00:51:41.400</a></span> | <span class="t">then we're flipping the rows because there's only one axis in them. We're only ever seeing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=3112" target="_blank">00:51:52.840</a></span> | <span class="t">one of these. So how could we use reverse each to reverse the rows? Or for that sake,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=3123" target="_blank">00:52:03.800</a></span> | <span class="t">reverse first each? Well, if we know that each will open up these boxes and close them down again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=3132" target="_blank">00:52:12.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So if we give it boxes that they can apply on, then it will work. So if I enclose</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=3141" target="_blank">00:52:21.160</a></span> | <span class="t">rank one, so enclose, remember, puts a box around things. If I just enclose the array,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=3146" target="_blank">00:52:26.600</a></span> | <span class="t">we get a multiple enclosed, we can keep making beautiful patterns. If I enclose rank one,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=3153" target="_blank">00:52:33.640</a></span> | <span class="t">then I took each row and made it into a scaler. That means we have a collection</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=3160" target="_blank">00:52:40.200</a></span> | <span class="t">of three scalers that's called the vector and nested vector. Now I can reverse each.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=3167" target="_blank">00:52:47.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Isn't there an arrow that does the same thing? Yes, for matrices, there is a down arrow,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=3173" target="_blank">00:52:53.880</a></span> | <span class="t">but it's not really necessary. It does exactly the same thing on matrices, but it doesn't do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=3179" target="_blank">00:52:59.240</a></span> | <span class="t">the same thing on higher rank arrays, so it's more general. In a sense, this itself is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=3184" target="_blank">00:53:04.360</a></span> | <span class="t">last-axis function, whereas enclose is a leading-axis function. It works on everything. And you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=3191" target="_blank">00:53:11.880</a></span> | <span class="t">restrict it to be on the lower rank. Oh, I see. So you can think of down arrow and enclose as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=3197" target="_blank">00:53:17.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the leading and trailing-axis versions of the same thing. Yeah, you could, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=3202" target="_blank">00:53:22.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe they don't look similar. They don't look similar, but that's this because...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=3210" target="_blank">00:53:30.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Enclosed with a bar would look like epsilon or something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=3213" target="_blank">00:53:33.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, they would look like this, but that means something else. Oh, okay. Yeah, you haven't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=3219" target="_blank">00:53:39.880</a></span> | <span class="t">learned the dance. You'll see. I don't give it a spot at all. But there's never any reason,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=3225" target="_blank">00:53:45.480</a></span> | <span class="t">really, to use a down arrow. It's just confusing on higher rank arrays. It's much easier conceptually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=3229" target="_blank">00:53:49.160</a></span> | <span class="t">to understand that this puts things into boxes, and it gets restricted to only see rows. So it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=3234" target="_blank">00:53:54.200</a></span> | <span class="t">puts the rows into boxes. And then we can disclose... The problem is we need to disclose each of these.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=3244" target="_blank">00:54:04.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So we need to disclose rank zero. The elements are of the vector. This vector has three elements,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=3254" target="_blank">00:54:14.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and I want to open up each one of them because it's confined to a box. Then we get our metrics back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=3259" target="_blank">00:54:19.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is exactly possible. But notice here, I'm enclosing only to applying each</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=3268" target="_blank">00:54:28.840</a></span> | <span class="t">so that I can, again, disclose. Well, that's the inverse operations of what each actually implies</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=3276" target="_blank">00:54:36.200</a></span> | <span class="t">because this each is actually over disclose rank zero and then enclose on top of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=3291" target="_blank">00:54:51.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So these negate each other. This makes scalars that are enclosed, and this opens scalars that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=3300" target="_blank">00:55:00.840</a></span> | <span class="t">are enclosed. And this encloses the results, and this discloses the results. So these two cancel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=3308" target="_blank">00:55:08.600</a></span> | <span class="t">each other out, and these two cancel each other out. And the only thing we have left is this rank</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=3315" target="_blank">00:55:15.400</a></span> | <span class="t">one, which it already is, and we're right back. So we can always look like that. You come full circle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=3320" target="_blank">00:55:20.840</a></span> | <span class="t">That's great. This is why you cannot use each on rows, but you can use rank on rows.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=3329" target="_blank">00:55:29.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And the interpreter is clever enough that if you write reverse rank one, it won't loop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=3345" target="_blank">00:55:45.080</a></span> | <span class="t">It will understand that it needs to reverse the rows, and it will do that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=3348" target="_blank">00:55:48.920</a></span> | <span class="t">as fast as it can do that with a vector instructions memory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=3354" target="_blank">00:55:54.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know if it can actually speed anything up here, but it will try.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=3363" target="_blank">00:56:03.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Wow, it's nice to learn APL from somebody who understands it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cfN9oVI5I&t=3372" target="_blank">00:56:12.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Thanks, Adan.
