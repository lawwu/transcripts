Maybe top-level takeaway from this talk is that pricing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=26" target="_blank">00:00:26.460</a></span> | <span class="t">is a deep, complicated topic.

We're going to cover some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=30" target="_blank">00:00:30.260</a></span> | <span class="t">tactical advice. But in general, the way you should think about pricing is pricing is a form of friction</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=35" target="_blank">00:00:35.020</a></span> | <span class="t">for your product. And sometimes that friction can be applied for a very good reason. Sometimes that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=40" target="_blank">00:00:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">friction can just prevent people from using your product. And so you really have to think about the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=44" target="_blank">00:00:44.680</a></span> | <span class="t">value your product is delivering, as well as the audience you're delivering it to, and the way that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=49" target="_blank">00:00:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">you're building and innovating in your product to start really thinking about pricing. Just a quick</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=53" target="_blank">00:00:53.780</a></span> | <span class="t">intro to ORB. ORB is a usage-based billing infrastructure company, so we help companies</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=58" target="_blank">00:00:58.780</a></span> | <span class="t">at lots of layers of the stack think about pricing and billing. Nowadays, a lot of our conversations</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=65" target="_blank">00:01:05.220</a></span> | <span class="t">first center around monetization and pricing as a practice, and then we get into the weeds of how do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=69" target="_blank">00:01:09.860</a></span> | <span class="t">we actually bill for this stuff. So maybe an intro tweet to start. This is Amjad. He's the CEO and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.420</a></span> | <span class="t">founder of Replit. Replit is one of ORB's customers. And this is a tweet actually pretty recent, starting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.520</a></span> | <span class="t">to think about how Replit agent should price itself. And so a pretty short tweet, but a lot of complexity</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=90" target="_blank">00:01:30.060</a></span> | <span class="t">actually packed in here. Really starting to think about, as you have Replit, which is a very popular</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.920</a></span> | <span class="t">agent that does programming, is starting to build full-stack web apps. How should a company like Replit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=102" target="_blank">00:01:42.580</a></span> | <span class="t">price their agent? Should it be like a super simple, every time the agent checkpoints, it charges you a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.740</a></span> | <span class="t">fixed amount? Or should it start aligning with the complexity of the change it made? And as you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.780</a></span> | <span class="t">start thinking through this question, you have to think through considerations like who is Replit built</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=117" target="_blank">00:01:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">for, right? What are the costs that Replit incurs? But also just the user experience of if I get charged</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=123" target="_blank">00:02:03.800</a></span> | <span class="t">some amount at the end of something that this agent has done without me really having control over what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the agent did other than the initial prompt, is that going to be surprising? Is that not going to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.840</a></span> | <span class="t">surprising, right? So these considerations apply particularly to agents because the work that the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=138" target="_blank">00:02:18.760</a></span> | <span class="t">agent is doing is fairly opaque or can be opaque, but they actually apply at every layer of the stack,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.800</a></span> | <span class="t">including the kind of infrastructure layer of the AI stack. So monetization as a whole is changing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe let's start with some kind of traditional principles in pricing and how pricing has always been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=155" target="_blank">00:02:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">thought about, right? So we're maybe coming from way back in the day, you know, you're selling a fixed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">license, you go to like Fry's Electronics and buy your TurboTax license. And then of course, now you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.600</a></span> | <span class="t">seat-based pricing subscription, maybe you're paying $30 a seat, all the way to you have this usage-based</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.380</a></span> | <span class="t">pricing, which is very dynamic. And then maybe you can consider outcome-based pricing as a further</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.600</a></span> | <span class="t">evolution of that. So in traditional pricing, you have a few key principles. You want to make sure that the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.460</a></span> | <span class="t">pricing is simple so that users can actually understand it. They can grok your pricing. They</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">know how they're going to pay for your tool. You want to produce some friction because it determines</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.680</a></span> | <span class="t">the value of your product. Like willingness to pay is a very real signal. And then you want to protect</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.520</a></span> | <span class="t">your margins, right? Traditionally, software margins have been very healthy. You know, a good software</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.540</a></span> | <span class="t">margin looks like 80%. Obviously, as you start getting closer to the infrastructure layer and as you start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">moving into the world of AI, these margins are much, much more variable, not necessarily unhealthy, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a lot more degenerate workloads that you can incur with an agent. So now starting to think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.080</a></span> | <span class="t">about AI native pricing, predictability matters a lot, right? I think especially when you're selling</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.420</a></span> | <span class="t">to more mature companies that need to budget and think about their, you know, cost profile using your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.540</a></span> | <span class="t">tool, they need to be able to predict how that cost is going to scale, not just on an individual</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">developer, how that cost might scale, but just generally throughout the company's buying process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.380</a></span> | <span class="t">AI is very early. So speed and just showing the value of your product and people being able to play</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.740</a></span> | <span class="t">around and experiment matters a lot. Oftentimes, at least in this space, it's not like people are coming</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to you buying a very established product. It's kind of your burden of proof to say, you know, here's how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.100</a></span> | <span class="t">our agent works. Just go try it and then start thinking about pricing. So maybe the friction point and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.940</a></span> | <span class="t">where it is has changed. And then I was just saying, um, cogs are variable, but, but not only are they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.780</a></span> | <span class="t">higher, they're also changing very, very quickly. I'm sure everyone in this room seen, okay, great. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.440</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, open AI, uh, cut, cut model costs by a third overnight. Uh, that has a pretty material impact</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">on like potentially the underlying cogs of many of these agentic tools. So, um, the three key principles</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">that, that I think matter here are like really thinking about the audience, who your product is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.140</a></span> | <span class="t">optimized for, what the value delivery mechanism looks like your margin structure. Um, and, and I say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">margin structure and not actually margins, because again, the underlying costs are changing very, very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.060</a></span> | <span class="t">rapidly. So you want to think about what are the axes of scaling rather than what is the literal margin</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=305" target="_blank">00:05:05.980</a></span> | <span class="t">on day one, especially if you're an earlier product. And then you want to give yourself the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.140</a></span> | <span class="t">flexibility to experiment over time. This comes with a lot of complexity, but I think it's very important</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.520</a></span> | <span class="t">because you're just not going to get it right the first time. Um, so, so these are kind of the principles</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.980</a></span> | <span class="t">to keep in mind, maybe going through one by one. Um, the, the way to kind of think about pricing for your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.080</a></span> | <span class="t">audiences, um, you know, what is their buying journey and what are they coming to you to, to buy and what value</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.540</a></span> | <span class="t">are they looking to get out of it? Right. Uh, if you're like, I, I, we, we talked to lots of people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">who are like, Oh, you know, service now is pricing is so silly. You go to their pricing page and it says</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">like contact sales. It's like, well, that's, that's a very, very different audience that they're selling</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=347" target="_blank">00:05:47.240</a></span> | <span class="t">to where they're probably cross selling some, some existing contracts. That is a big enterprise commit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">They want you to talk to sales because they really want to tailor the value to their sales motion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=357" target="_blank">00:05:57.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. And then on the other hand, companies that are selling to individual developers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">there's not a procurement team. There's no purchasing process. They want you to click,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=364" target="_blank">00:06:04.740</a></span> | <span class="t">try it and start using the product immediately. So, so, um, don't just think about the kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=371" target="_blank">00:06:11.100</a></span> | <span class="t">point of entry, but think about who's behind that at the company. Uh, is it going to be a cross</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=375" target="_blank">00:06:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">functional decision? Is it something that someone can just insert into, you know, as, as a vendor on day</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.500</a></span> | <span class="t">one, or is there going to be more of a process around it? And then also, uh, start to kind of think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=385" target="_blank">00:06:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">about, uh, what users are seeking as quickly as possible. If they're seeking a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.620</a></span> | <span class="t">proof point, then perhaps you want to be able to give them that proof point before you insert</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">pricing into the equation. Here's, here's an example, again, using replet, um, couple of things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=399" target="_blank">00:06:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">to note here. Uh, you'll see that there's one, a lot of tiers and pricing is actually quite</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=405" target="_blank">00:06:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">transparent. Obviously it's a free tier, right? Indicating that they want you to see the value</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=409" target="_blank">00:06:49.560</a></span> | <span class="t">without having to do a ton of work. Think about the monetization. Um, and, uh, one thing that's kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=416" target="_blank">00:06:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">subtle is oftentimes pricing and packaging really starts to, uh, dictate what sort of use case they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">are imagining you to use, right? Like, um, you know, what models you have access to, how many agent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=429" target="_blank">00:07:09.260</a></span> | <span class="t">checkpoints you have access to included, how many seats you might have included. Uh, it kind of starts</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=433" target="_blank">00:07:13.900</a></span> | <span class="t">positioning your product. Is it a multiplayer product? Is it something that people are going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=438" target="_blank">00:07:18.660</a></span> | <span class="t">be using daily or is it something that you're going to be using, you know, maybe like five times a month,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=442" target="_blank">00:07:22.620</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, the way you package it really determines the incentives that you're pushing onto your users</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=447" target="_blank">00:07:27.020</a></span> | <span class="t">and obviously controlling for the costs that you might pay on the backend. Here's another example</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=451" target="_blank">00:07:31.660</a></span> | <span class="t">from Unify, which is, I think, uh, uh, agent agent to company, but it's like targeted at revenue and go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=456" target="_blank">00:07:36.780</a></span> | <span class="t">to market teams. One, you'll see the, like the price point is a lot higher. Um, I want you to like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=461" target="_blank">00:07:41.480</a></span> | <span class="t">forget whether it's monthly or annually or any of that, just like you come on this page, the price point</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=465" target="_blank">00:07:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">is higher that communicates something psychologically. And then they're like second duty years are custom,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=470" target="_blank">00:07:50.180</a></span> | <span class="t">right. Um, again, I, and, and maybe the third thing to point out here is that 50,000 credits,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=476" target="_blank">00:07:56.180</a></span> | <span class="t">200,000 credits, 600,000 credits. I actually don't know what that means, but that seems like a large</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=480" target="_blank">00:08:00.840</a></span> | <span class="t">number that communicates something about the workflows they expect to participate in and like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=484" target="_blank">00:08:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">what that might mean for how you use Unify. Right. Um, of course, like it maybe goes instead,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=490" target="_blank">00:08:10.100</a></span> | <span class="t">but the set of logos you put on your pricing page is also very important. Um, are you tailoring it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=494" target="_blank">00:08:14.820</a></span> | <span class="t">towards, okay, we, we service the best developer brands or we service the like fortune 100 enterprises.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=499" target="_blank">00:08:19.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and so pricing is, is not just the price point, but, but of course also the, the whole experience</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=505" target="_blank">00:08:25.060</a></span> | <span class="t">of what someone sees when they land on this page. Um, let's, let's talk a little bit about margins. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=511" target="_blank">00:08:31.040</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, as, as, uh, the, the underlying architecture of your product changes, of course,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=517" target="_blank">00:08:37.320</a></span> | <span class="t">your, your margins are going to change. These inputs are changing very quickly. Um, one,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=520" target="_blank">00:08:40.820</a></span> | <span class="t">one, one interesting example here is, uh, you, you, as much as possible, you want to think about,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=526" target="_blank">00:08:46.520</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, the differentiation of your product also in R and D innovation and try to pass that on to your users as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=532" target="_blank">00:08:52.020</a></span> | <span class="t">basically pricing leverage. Uh, a good example of this is like Cloudflare has built their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=537" target="_blank">00:08:57.420</a></span> | <span class="t">infrastructure on and their workers infrastructure on these like isolates, right? So, so they're kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=541" target="_blank">00:09:01.880</a></span> | <span class="t">of lightweight compute machines. And so they can charge for CPU milliseconds. And so if someone is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=547" target="_blank">00:09:07.640</a></span> | <span class="t">building like an agentic app on Cloudflare and it makes like a, you know, call out to open AI or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=552" target="_blank">00:09:12.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Anthropic, you're not getting charged for that because Cloudflare is just charging you for CPU</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=556" target="_blank">00:09:16.340</a></span> | <span class="t">milliseconds instead of wall time. I think that's a really good example of them, you know, taking an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=560" target="_blank">00:09:20.820</a></span> | <span class="t">architectural bet, um, which, which might be good for many, many reasons, but it's a really good fit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=565" target="_blank">00:09:25.500</a></span> | <span class="t">for building AI agents or generally AI software on top of Cloudflare. So that's, I see that as an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=570" target="_blank">00:09:30.860</a></span> | <span class="t">example of like passing down technical innovation to the end user. Um, and then the other thing to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=575" target="_blank">00:09:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">consider about your margins is you don't have to protect them at all costs. You just have to think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=580" target="_blank">00:09:40.920</a></span> | <span class="t">about what are the extreme edge cases and what are you doing to like prevent those outcomes, right? So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=585" target="_blank">00:09:45.940</a></span> | <span class="t">if you have these potentially really degenerate workloads, uh, how do you incentivize reasonable</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=590" target="_blank">00:09:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">usage? Do you put in rate limits or guardrails? Um, you don't have to kind of linearly necessarily</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=596" target="_blank">00:09:56.100</a></span> | <span class="t">scale costs with usage. You, you can protect your margins potentially in, in different ways. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=602" target="_blank">00:10:02.220</a></span> | <span class="t">this is an example from Jasper. I think this, this blog post and pricing has changed since,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=606" target="_blank">00:10:06.600</a></span> | <span class="t">since I pulled this example, but you know, Jasper realized like, Hey, we're, we're targeted toward</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=611" target="_blank">00:10:11.180</a></span> | <span class="t">marketing teams. Marketing teams don't want to count credits. Like when they're, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=614" target="_blank">00:10:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">basically writing marketing copy. And so, uh, they, they talk a little bit in this blog post about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=620" target="_blank">00:10:20.560</a></span> | <span class="t">how they've architected around being able to like switch between models under the hood seamlessly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=625" target="_blank">00:10:25.580</a></span> | <span class="t">You don't have to choose the right model for the job. And as a result of that, they went unlimited</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=629" target="_blank">00:10:29.780</a></span> | <span class="t">on, uh, each of the three tiers. So you're, you're no longer counting credits as you're using Jasper.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=634" target="_blank">00:10:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, uh, this kind of highlights the core value prop of the product, which is they want to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=640" target="_blank">00:10:40.060</a></span> | <span class="t">a really critical part of that workflow. And they don't want you to have to like pick and choose when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=644" target="_blank">00:10:44.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you use Jasper because you might have credits or might run out of credits. So again, kind of trying to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=650" target="_blank">00:10:50.220</a></span> | <span class="t">take, is there like an architectural, uh, advantage you have and how can you pass that on to your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=655" target="_blank">00:10:55.480</a></span> | <span class="t">pricing model? Finally, I want to talk about flexibility. Um, you know, you, you all, as,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=661" target="_blank">00:11:01.500</a></span> | <span class="t">as you're working in your teams, uh, you're constantly improving your product. You're putting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=665" target="_blank">00:11:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of R and D into it. Um, one thing that is used to be true, especially in the seat based world</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=670" target="_blank">00:11:10.440</a></span> | <span class="t">is like, you'd have R and D over here shipping a ton, um, increasing the product value. And then you'd</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=676" target="_blank">00:11:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">have like a once a year, okay, we're changing our seat price from $20 to $25. Um, one advantage</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=680" target="_blank">00:11:20.980</a></span> | <span class="t">you have in the AI world is like, uh, the value is much closer to the end users. It's not necessarily</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=686" target="_blank">00:11:26.500</a></span> | <span class="t">like a $20 a seat thing. It's like someone is literally seeing, okay, I'm, I'm taking this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=690" target="_blank">00:11:30.780</a></span> | <span class="t">action. This agent is giving me this output. Okay. It's getting better. It's getting, it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=694" target="_blank">00:11:34.760</a></span> | <span class="t">better, it's getting better. So I think not only do you as a business have a responsibility</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=698" target="_blank">00:11:38.740</a></span> | <span class="t">to incrementally evolve your price as, uh, you know, you invest R and D, but I think it's,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=704" target="_blank">00:11:44.780</a></span> | <span class="t">it's honestly a lot more understandable for customers why that's happening because the,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=709" target="_blank">00:11:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the monetization is much closer to the value of the product. Um, so, so, uh, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=714" target="_blank">00:11:54.420</a></span> | <span class="t">obviously in orbs customer base, but in general, we are seeing people, uh, make many, many more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=720" target="_blank">00:12:00.020</a></span> | <span class="t">price changes, not just once a year or twice a year, but in fact, some customers making price</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=724" target="_blank">00:12:04.100</a></span> | <span class="t">changes, uh, two, three times a month. Um, and again, there's, there's caveats that come</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=729" target="_blank">00:12:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">with that. Uh, you have to think about, you know, what, what is that complexity that introduces in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=734" target="_blank">00:12:14.500</a></span> | <span class="t">the, in the mental model of your end users, how are you going to manage change?

Right?

Um, finally, the thing I'll say is, uh, as you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=781" target="_blank">00:13:01.800</a></span> | <span class="t">iterating, you, you really want to, as much as possible, be able to simulate the impact that this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=787" target="_blank">00:13:07.740</a></span> | <span class="t">pricing change is going to have on your users. In particular, I think, uh, you want to be able to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=792" target="_blank">00:13:12.460</a></span> | <span class="t">simulate, uh, different usage patterns. So if you think about your users and cohorts, um, some might</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=797" target="_blank">00:13:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">be using it for very different use cases. What is that revenue mix going to look like? What is your top,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=802" target="_blank">00:13:22.840</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, revenue generating customer going to, how are they going to change with a new pricing model? You want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=807" target="_blank">00:13:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">be able to do that in a, in a data informed way, especially if you're running at a, at a reasonable</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=812" target="_blank">00:13:32.420</a></span> | <span class="t">scale. Here's some predictions I have as, as we're wrapping up for AI agent pricing. I think, um, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=819" target="_blank">00:13:39.380</a></span> | <span class="t">know, the, the price wars will continue. We're seeing agents get cheaper and cheaper. Um, and, and, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=824" target="_blank">00:13:44.780</a></span> | <span class="t">know, I think you're, you, we should expect people to try to give effectively unlimited plans. I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=831" target="_blank">00:13:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">there'll still be caps.

So we'll try to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=841" target="_blank">00:14:01.380</a></span> | <span class="t">try to converge to effectively unlimited. Um, I think outcome-based pricing is going to get more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=847" target="_blank">00:14:07.260</a></span> | <span class="t">real. We are seeing some companies, uh, do that already, but the, the, the hard part about outcome</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=852" target="_blank">00:14:12.700</a></span> | <span class="t">based pricing is defining what the actual SLA is like, what, what is the outcome and how do you measure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=858" target="_blank">00:14:18.300</a></span> | <span class="t">it?

Um, I think like, we're going to see a lot of clear</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=863" target="_blank">00:14:23.780</a></span> | <span class="t">definition of success language and contracts and like people really trying to get, uh, precise about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=870" target="_blank">00:14:30.260</a></span> | <span class="t">what the outcome is that they're charging for. And then, um, I think there's going to be a lot more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=876" target="_blank">00:14:36.040</a></span> | <span class="t">real-time visibility, spend management, uh, balance alerts. I think the kind of workflow around pricing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3sZbaxOmw&t=881" target="_blank">00:14:41.860</a></span> | <span class="t">and monetization is going to get, uh, more and more sophisticated.
