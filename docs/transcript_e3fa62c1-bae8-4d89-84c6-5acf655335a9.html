These are going to consist of things that just come to my mind, probably current events, etc. That I just want to comment on speedily and that also doesn't require a lengthy episode.</p><p>But my goal is to not comment just merely to comment, but to do so in a way and within a framework that does justice to truth and reality. So on this side note, I want to dig into the reality of the inconspicuous servants. So in order to do that correctly, let me read from 1 Corinthians 12, 22-25.</p><p>1 Corinthians 12, 22-25 reading from the Legacy Standard Bible says this, "On the contrary, how much more is it that the members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary, and those members of the body which we think as less honorable, on these we bestow more abundant honor, and our less presentable members become much more presentable, whereas our presentable members have no such need.</p><p>But God has so composed the body, giving more abundant honor to that member which lacked, so that there may be no division in the body, but that the members may have the same care for one another." A couple of things to note here, in verse 22 Paul writes, "How much more is it that the members of the body which seem to be weaker, not that they actually are, but how much more that they seem." So the body parts that may seem weaker to us are not weaker objectively.</p><p>That is merely our perception. This thought is expanded in the next verse, in verse 23 Paul writes, "That those members of the body we think as less honorable, not that they actually are, but that we think as less honorable. On these same body parts, we bestow more abundant honor, and our less presentable members become much more presentable." And you know, I could totally attest to the veracity of these statements on an experiential level.</p><p>So let me explain what I mean by that. When I was contemplating becoming an elder, one of the many things that I knew would change when I became an elder was that I would naturally become more visible. Along with that, certain things come with the territory. Part of that territory is that people would thank me for various things, and my hidden works would become, well, less hidden.</p><p>And don't get me wrong. I'm absolutely not scolding people that thank me. That would just be weird. People thank me to encourage me, and I appreciate that. However, some of the most rewarding times in my life were those times when I was in charge of the so-called "less honorable" ministries, the so-called "weaker" ministries.</p><p>And it was so rewarding because there was no struggle in my heart as to why I was doing what I was doing. There was no struggle because people didn't want to do it. So for me to do it, there wasn't really a struggle as to why. I didn't really need to question my motives, right?</p><p>There was a need, and it was going to be filled. Matthew 6, 5-6, although it's talking about prayer, the principle applies here. Jesus states in Matthew 6, verses 5-6, He says, "And when you pray, you are not to be like the hypocrites, for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and on the street corners so that they may be seen by men.</p><p>Truly, I say to you, they have their reward in full. But you, when you pray, go into your inner room, and when you have shut your door, pray to your Father who is in secret, and your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you." You know, there are some servant teams that have a long wait list, but there are many servant teams that we would never even dream of serving, and not because we don't have the capacity, but because, quite frankly, we see it as beneath us.</p><p>To many of us, it is offensive to even suggest we serve in these ministries, but that is a far, far cry from God's own heart, a far cry from God's own perspective. 1 Samuel 16, 7 states this, "For God does not see as man sees, since man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart." And if it is indeed the case that we will only serve in certain capacities, what do you think that states about your actual maturity?</p><p>I'm not talking about your own perceived maturity, I'm talking about your actual maturity. Do you think that God doesn't see your own heart? So my admonition to all of us who are willing to listen is this, let's seek to have that perspective, that mindset, that God is the only audience we need to please, that being in the minority sometimes when you serve doesn't discount the importance of your particular ministry, that God is a God who sees and rewards, and that alone makes inconspicuous service all the more necessary, that makes it all the more only what we need.</p><p>In Matthew 6, 2, Jesus is talking about secret prayer, but again, the same principle applies to secret service to God. He says this, "Therefore, when you give to the poor, do not sound a trumpet before you as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may be glorified by men.</p><p>Truly, I say to you, they have their reward in full." The people who are committed to secret service, knowing God sees, understands this verse in a way very few of us do. They know the Lord looks at the heart. So because of that, no ministry is beneath them. So to all you inconspicuous servants, I want to say to you, be encouraged.</p><p>You know how to persevere when it seems like you're the only one who cares about the ministries that you're involved in, that constantly need new volunteers. You understand how to process frustration without belittling everyone else. You're okay with doing the thankless jobs. And on the final accounting of all things, your works will vindicate the way you've chosen to spend your time.</p><p>Repeating 1 Corinthians 12, 23 to 24, "And those members of the body, which we think as less honorable, on these we bestow more abundant honor, and our less presentable members become much more presentable, whereas our more presentable members have no such need. For God has composed the body, giving more abundant honor to that member which lacked." I want to give a shout out to some of the more inconspicuous servants.</p><p>And as I give this shout out, I know there are many, many more that I'm missing. And if that is you, you are genuinely glad that I'm missing you, right? So with that said, my brother Aaron Go has done just an awesome job in leading logistics. Martin Mao has been a beast leading cleanup.</p><p>Brian Pomona Kim has been a stud with parking. Now I'm not saying these guys are sinless. I'm not saying they've reached the pinnacle of sanctification. And it doesn't mean that if they ever leave these teams, they're somehow falling away or less mature. I just want to take some time to recognize them.</p><p>As Paul writes, "Bestow more abundant honor." This is James Hong, and I'm signing off.</p></div></div></body></html>
