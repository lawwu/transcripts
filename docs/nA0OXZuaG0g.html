Kennedy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">When Bobby was 14, his dad was running for president on a platform of civil rights, civil liberties, lifting Americans out of poverty and opposing the Vietnam War.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">He had just won the California primary when he was tragically assassinated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">RFK Jr. graduated from Harvard and the University of Virginia Law School and became an environmental lawyer who aggressively litigated against corporate polluters and government agencies that were failing to regulate them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">He has always put the health and safety of the American people at the forefront of his activism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And this has made him controversial at times as he has questioned the safety of some pharmaceutical products and also criticized COVID restrictions during the pandemic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">For this, the mainstream media has tried to paint him as a, quote, "conspiracy theorist."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But given that so many conspiracy theories about COVID have been vindicated, Tablet Magazine wrote, quote,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">"At this point, the fact that Robert F.

target="_blank">00:03:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">But the biggest reason why I think his candidacy is so interesting and relevant is that it harkens back to a Democratic Party that believed in peace instead of war,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">free speech and civil liberties instead of censorship, building up the middle class instead of the donor class,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and opposing corporate greed, especially in the military industrial complex, which is a message you just don't hear much anymore coming from the Democratic side of the aisle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So with that, Bobby Kennedy, welcome to the program.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.560</a></span> | <span

class="t">So maybe we could start with foreign policy, something we've discussed here, specifically the Ukraine and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and our support of that war.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Sax, would you like to tee up a question for Mr. Kennedy?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I think Bobby's tweets on the subject show that he has a really deep understanding of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">He's been saying a lot of things that I've been saying since the beginning of the war, which is not just the fact that we're risking World War III over, you know, getting involved in a country that isn't a treaty ally of the United States, it's never been a vital interest of the United States.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think your critique goes deeper, because you actually understand the causes of how this war started.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So maybe, you know, Bobby, you could speak to that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.120</a></span> | <span class="t">How did we end up in this proxy war with Russia from your standpoint?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, you know, first of all, let me start by saying this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I supported the humanitarian aid to the Ukraine, which is what we were told initially was the mission, although I was suspicious of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And my son, as I've mentioned, actually went over, left law school, did not tell us where he was going, and went over and joined the Foreign Legion and fought in the Kharkiv offensive with a special forces group.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">He was served as a machine gunner.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=316" target="_blank">00:05:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">He was in engagements with the Russians.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=319" target="_blank">00:05:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">But he feels the same way, essentially, that I do, that this is no longer a humanitarian mission.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And all the decisions the United States has made since the start have been about prolonging the war, about maximizing the violence of the war, and being absolutely intransigent against the many opportunities to actually settle the war.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And my understanding of the war is that not that Zelensky is pushing this war as hard as he can, but that the neocons in the White House want this war.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">They want regime change with the Russians.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">They want to exhaust the Russian armies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=367" target="_blank">00:06:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">This is what Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in 2022.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=371" target="_blank">00:06:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Our objective is to exhaust and degrade Russian forces so they cannot fight anywhere else in the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=379" target="_blank">00:06:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And President Biden acknowledged that one of his objectives in the war is regime change in Russia, removing Vladimir Putin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=386" target="_blank">00:06:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, if those are the objectives, that is the opposite of a humanitarian mission.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=391" target="_blank">00:06:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">That is a mission to maximize casualties, to prolong the war.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=396" target="_blank">00:06:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It's essentially a war of attrition, and that's what we're seeing.</span></div><div

Ukrainian youth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA0OXZuaG0g&t=404" target="_blank">00:06:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">There have been over
