It does seem to me though that any model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kxTfBXZTds&t=425" target="_blank">00:07:05.580</a></span> | <span class="t">release will be fairly quickly made autonomous. Look at the just two week gap the release of GPT-4</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kxTfBXZTds&t=431" target="_blank">00:07:11.820</a></span> | <span class="t">and the release of AutoGPT. So anyone releasing a model needs to assume that it's going to be made</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kxTfBXZTds&t=437" target="_blank">00:07:17.660</a></span> | <span class="t">to be autonomous fairly quickly. Next Zuckerberg talked about super intelligence and compared it to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kxTfBXZTds&t=443" target="_blank">00:07:23.800</a></span> | <span class="t">a corporate model. So what does that mean? Well it's a very simple thing. It's a very simple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kxTfBXZTds&t=444" target="_blank">00:07:24.680</a></span> | <span class="t">operation. You still didn't answer the question of what year we're going to have super intelligence. I'd like to hold you to that. No I'm just kidding. But is there something you could say about the timeline as you think about the development of AGI super intelligence systems? Sure. So I still don't think I have any particular insight on when like a singular AI system that is a general intelligence will get created. But I think the one thing that most people in the discourse</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kxTfBXZTds&t=474" target="_blank">00:07:54.660</a></span> | <span class="t">that I've seen about this haven't really grappled with is that we do seem to have organizations and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kxTfBXZTds&t=481" target="_blank">00:08:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">structures in the world that exhibit greater than human intelligence already. So one example is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kxTfBXZTds&t=488" target="_blank">00:08:08.920</a></span> | <span class="t">company. But I certainly hope that Meta with tens of thousands of people makes smarter decisions than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kxTfBXZTds&t=495" target="_blank">00:08:15.480</a></span> | <span class="t">one person. But I think that that would be pretty bad if it didn't. I think he's underestimating a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kxTfBXZTds&t=500" target="_blank">00:08:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">super intelligence which would be far faster and more impressive I believe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kxTfBXZTds&t=504" target="_blank">00:08:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">than any company.

Apparently GPT-4 discovered the same trick</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kxTfBXZTds&t=521" target="_blank">00:08:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">as alpha dev and the author sarcastically asked can I publish this on nature?
