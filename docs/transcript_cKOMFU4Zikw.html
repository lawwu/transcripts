And either way, you have this kind of world where there's a bunch of different beings that all have rights and interests that matter, and they vote on how to set up the world so that we can all hopefully thrive and have a good time.</p><p>We have less and less material scarcity, so fewer and fewer trade-offs need to be made. That would be great. Does anything strike you as unimaginable about that? Yeah, the fact that you can have beings that can be copied at will, but also there's some method of voting that... Yeah, that's a problem that would have to be solved.</p><p>We have a lot of, today we have a lot of attention paid to how voting system works, who gets to vote, and how we avoid things being unfair. And yeah, it's definitely true that if we decided there was some kind of digital entity that it should have the right to vote, and that digital entity was able to copy itself, you could get some havoc right there.</p><p>You'd want to come up with some system that maybe restricts how many copies you can make of yourself. These are problems that I'm hoping can be handled in a way that, while not perfect, could be non-catastrophic by a society that hasn't been derailed by some huge concentration of power or misaligned AI systems.</p></div></div></body></html>
