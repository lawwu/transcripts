When I was younger and I was broke and I didn't have any money, freedom just simply meant having enough time to do whatever I wanted with my life, not being limited by money, being able to live the fullest life that I could without being restricted.</p><p>So it was this limitless idea. And that really was my thinking when I started my financial independence journey. I just need the money to get out. I just need some space. I just don't ever want to be constricted. I don't want to limit what my family can do. I don't want to limit what I can do.</p><p>I want to make the most of this one life. But interestingly, as I acquired more money, I started to change my definition of freedom. And I realized that freedom really wasn't about unlimited choices. It was just about having the ability to do what you love when you want to do it.</p><p>And those are two different things. So for me, I really struggled with this idea of how am I going to spend my time when I reach financial independence? What am I going to do? And I realized that I needed to create some limits in my life. I've realized that freedom really actually only exists within limits.</p></div></div></body></html>
