It's not what Mark did, it's when he did it. And the king of the cloud is Salesforce. Please welcome Mark Benioff. One of the things that really matters to me is having a positive global impact. Technology is not good or bad, it's what you do with it that matters.</p><p>In your quest to change the world, don't forget to do something for other people. And that was a moment in time when I said, wow, when I start a company, I'm going to make sure that philanthropy and giving and generosity and these values are in the culture of the company from day one.</p><p>You want to sit here? Or you want the couch? You want to sit on the couch? Where do you want to sit? I'll give you the couch, I'll sit here. You deserve the couch. You deserve it. The big couch. OK. A little too close. It's nice to see you.</p><p>I warned you that I'm not the interviewer in the group, but you chose me, so I'm honored. But you're the nice one. Oh, OK. Thank you. Am I right? Is he the nice one? And you're the one that all the women really like. Like I'll talk to my friends at dinner, they're like, you know, Sax, what's he like?</p><p>He's amazing. Well, let's just say we're honored to have Mark Benioff here, and truly who's a visionary in the world of software. And I would say, you know, there's probably a lot of- And I thank my mother for writing that video, by the way, as well. Mom, thank you for writing that for me.</p><p>You know, in the world of business software in particular, we don't have that many people who you can describe as visionaries, but you consistently have been one. You really- It's true. You got the, I think, the whole- We're sitting now on the edge of the couch. OK. Here we go.</p><p>Maybe we'll end up on the floor. I don't know. What's going to happen? I'm trying to keep it engaging. Moving around a lot. Oh, OK. All right. Is this how it's going to be the whole time? Way worse. Way worse? OK. All right. Let me finish this little intro here.</p><p>I forgot where I was. So- Can I just, before we start, you know, listen. So I want to just do something I would not normally do, and this is going to be a little bit of a thing, but I just have to do a little riff on this. We just heard an extraordinary presentation on an extraordinary man, and there's somebody who's amazing that most people don't get to hear of, and we just heard his name quite a few times.</p><p>His name is Shin Yamanaka, Yamanaka-san. He is based in Kyoto, Japan, but he works half-time at UCSF, and it's amazing what his vision for the world is that he thinks, basically, that we're salamanders and we're going to be able to regenerate ourselves, and that's amazing. And so I've been friends with him maybe for a decade, but I fund his research, and so a lot of these things to watch him have these breakthroughs, you heard about the Yamanaka factors, the Yamanaka factors, which are basically this idea that Yamanaka had this breakthrough in Kyoto, you know, basically he's hanging out there in his lab eating the sushi, the whole thing, and then boom, and he goes, "If I take these four things, I can take an ordinary skin cell, just any little skin cell, and turn it into a stem cell," which is like the heart of human existence, and he did it, and he was able to repeat it and repeat it and repeat it, and he won the Nobel Prize for it, pretty cool.</p><p>And then he, and I'm going to get the pronunciation of this wrong, but he then was able to take that stem cell, put it into your eye, if you have damacular degeneration, and boom, healed the eye, because the eye regenerated. Then he worked with a buddy of his in the lab next door, and he took the same thing, took the stem cells, and he turned it on a cookie sheet, and it looked like it was like a plastic thing on the cookie sheet, it was really cool, and then he took out somebody's cornea that was all screwed up, cut the material out of the cookie sheet, popped it in the eye, and the guy could see, and was like, "Amazing," then he's like, "Listen, this is amazing, I bet I can grow a brain," so he took the stem cells, and he started growing brains called organoids, and he's like, "Got a cookie sheet of brains," and I'm like, "Really?" He's like, "This is amazing, look at all the brains," and then I went and saw him and had lunch with him, and I'm like, "What's happening with the brains?" He's like, "I stopped the brains." I'm like, "Why did you stop the brains?" "I think they can feel the pain." I'm like, "Oh, scary," then I said to him, "Now what are you doing?" "Oh, I'm growing intestines," I'm like, "Whoa, intestines, is that good?" He's like, "Huge idea, I can now grow intestines on the cookie sheet, and taking the stem cells, I've got a whole intestine here, and then he can turn it into a lab for all the horrible things that people get in their gut, and all these diseases that have never been cured, but now you have a real simulated environment," so he's an incredible person.</p><p>Anyway. Where do you want to go with that? I'm going, I'm going with this, you got to stay with me, I'm trying to help bring the energy up in here, follow, just hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, wait, wait, wait, this is going to get good. So then I'm like, you heard the story, like at the end they said, "Listen, how do I get these regenerative factors going inside myself?" So UCSF just published research based on funding grant that I and others have given them, and they had a breakthrough that the regenerative factor inside your own blood is called PF4, and the way you get PF4, and I'm not going to get this exactly right, because you know, I'm in software, I'm not a doctor, so just follow with me.</p><p>I thought that's what we're going to talk about today. You know that, I know, but I got to tell you this, because I'm scot-so-jack watching that. One is, it was either that or those crazy shots you have backstage, I don't know. Oh, okay. Number one is, PF4, you get more regenerative factors in your body, like calorie restriction, and if you know David and I, that does not sound very good.</p><p>Two, working out with weights, also not exactly our top thing. Parabiosis, do you know what that is? Parabiosis kind of came out of research published a decade ago in the New York Times and others, which came from Saul Valeda, another person I work with at UCSF, where they took the blood of a young mouse and put it into an old mouse, and then the old mouse got young again.</p><p>And that was moving the PF4 into that old mouse. So that's it. And the fourth thing is clothotherapy, which is a genetic therapy that I don't really understand. These four things can start to generate more of these things inside your body. So then I'm like getting excited, I'm like, God, I have these problems, maybe I can regenerate different parts of myself, whatever.</p><p>And so I'm talking to my doctor at UCSF, because I'm going through my own serious problem, where I'm like, my left leg is like a half an inch shorter than my right leg, and I'm running on the treadmill, and I'm always ripping my Achilles, ripping, ripping. And all of a sudden, my Achilles looks like it has a donut.</p><p>And in fact, I went to UCSF, and there was like an MRI, you know, well, how many of you have had an MRI? Raise your hand so you know what is horrible it is. Anyway, you get in this big machine, they're looking at my Achilles, they come out, they're all like this.</p><p>Oh, sorry about this. Really horrible. And I'm like, so I kind of took this thought, and I'm like talking to my doctor, I'm like, why can't we like, use some of this, figure out what we can do. So he's like, all right, come back on Wednesday. So I come back on Wednesday, at five o'clock, you know, I'm in Mission Bay at UCSF.</p><p>And I'm like, hey, Anthony, where is everybody? I think we're going to talk about it, come into my lab. So I come into the lab, they've got like a centrifuge there, all this stuff going on. I'm like, well, this is interesting. He's like, did you work out today? Yes, I work out.</p><p>Do you following the PFR? I'm doing it. Okay. This is what we're going to do. It's going to be very straightforward because we have two things we can do with you, Mark. Number one, we can just take your Achilles, and we can bring you into surgery right now, we'll just shave off half your Achilles, and then put you in a boot and see where you are in six months.</p><p>I go, doesn't sound great. Second idea. What we're going to do is we're going to take a scalpel, right here, we're going to cut into your Achilles like 20 times and into your ankle. I'm going to take your butt, I'm going to spin it, I'm going to try to find the PF4 in your plasma, I'm going to inject it into your Achilles and into your plasma, slice into it with my scalpel.</p><p>I go, sounds great. There's one problem. I go, what's that? We don't use anesthesia to do that. Why? Because it destabilizes the PRP and the plasma and all the PF4 and all that. I'm like, let's rock. Let's rock. So he did the whole thing, and then boom, I'm like a salamander.</p><p>They grew me a new Achilles right in place. So that thing that you just heard, that shit is real, and it's pretty awesome. I have a question for you. So if he can sell $3 billion into his startup, I should probably start, I'm ready to go. Got the pitch.</p><p>Do you ever consider that you missed your calling as a scientific researcher? Definitely not. Definitely not. You're happy with the choices you made. Well, that's an incredible story. So you are one of the first to actually try using the Yamanaka factors on yourself? I wouldn't think I'm one of the first, but I think that it's very real and it's going to have a huge impact on our lives, and I think that we should be supporting these medical researchers.</p><p>I think it's one of the reasons that I've put almost $1 billion into UCSF and philanthropy, because I believe in these people who have dedicated their lives to basic science and doing and meeting them. They're so inspiring to me, and I just had lunch with Yamanaka and Sal Vallada and Anthony Luke and another incredible researcher, Mark Moiser, at my house, and we're talking about the intersection between oncology and regenerative medicine, which is like two completely different worlds that don't talk to each other.</p><p>And it's what inspires me, that we can work with others to give them the entrepreneurial push to go do something incredible, and these people are just awesome. Each one is amazing. That is incredible. So let's shift gears and talk about something else. Nice coincidence with the oncology. Yeah, I know.</p><p>It's a great story. I know you're very philanthropic and do it a lot with UCSF, so kudos to you for encouraging that type of research. Let's shift to another thing that's having a huge impact on our lives, which is the cloud and software, where you were a pioneer. You started Salesforce back in 1999.</p><p>25 years ago. 25 years ago. And how long have you been a public company for at this point? 2004. So 20 years. 20 years. And one of the things I noticed- I'd rather count 80 earnings calls. Yeah. Well, actually, speaking of earnings, here, let's see if we have this slide.</p><p>Do we have earnings? Well, first- Oh, yeah. Oh, boy. What slide is that? This is your stock chart over 25, I think 25 years, 20 years. You're almost at your all-time high. I guess there's no linear success, exactly, right? Yeah. That's a really good point. Yeah, we had a- You just keep going.</p><p>We basically had a bubble. We had a bubble in late 2021. You keep going. We had a huge correction in '22. There was? I need to make a note of that. But you're basically back to where you were. This is one of your tweets. It is. Actually, this is one of the things I appreciate about the way you do earnings calls, is you just put out this really simple tweet, and it shows a progression.</p><p>And if you like looking at numbers the way I do and seeing patterns in them, one of the things I noticed a while ago was that if you start at the bottom and work your way to the top, that Salesforce is growing by about 20% a year. And if you look at it over three years, that's roughly a double.</p><p>So every three years, Salesforce was doubling. And that means that over a decade, it's growing 10x. And so every decade is basically exponential. If you can stick with it long enough. That was one of the patterns I noticed with Salesforce. Look, I think that the growth, obviously, is incredible, the $38 billion.</p><p>And obviously, the cash flow is incredible. It's more than Coca-Cola did, I think, last quarter. But the margin is incredible. But let me just say, probably the best decision we made, and it's not on the slide, which is the day we started the company, we put 1% of our equity, 1% of our profit, 1% of our product, 1% of all of our employees' time into a 50713 foundation.</p><p>Now at the time, it was very easy, because we had no employees. We had no equity. We had no profit. So it wasn't very complicated. But that idea, though, really kind of created the foundation of the company, because we were able to do now, and I think you know the numbers, right, we're almost 10 million hours of volunteerism.</p><p>We've been able to give away almost a billion in grants. We run almost 100,000 nonprofits and NGOs for free on our service. And I think it really set the stage that business could be the greatest platform for change when it came for Salesforce. It gave it that philanthropic platform.</p><p>So is there $2 billion in equity sitting in that 501(c)(3) at this point? A lot. Well, there's more. I think there's about a half a billion in the foundation, and a lot has been already given out. And then we give out more every year, and every month, every day, whatever.</p><p>But like on Monday, we'll give another $25 million approximately to the San Francisco and Oakland public schools. And that is, you know, we've given them about $150 million. I mean, it's obviously, I went to public schools, it was very important to me, but my mother was a teacher in the San Francisco public schools.</p><p>But also our employees, you know, we have 75,000 employees, their kids are in the public schools. And so it's a key part of our mantra and our culture that we're trying to support public education, adopt a public school. I really think that each one of us needs to focus more on the public education system in the United States.</p><p>It's something I encourage in, not all my employees, but whenever I do a presentation, I'm like, you know, my public school is like a block from my house, Presidio Middle School, and I just went down there and knocked on the door, and they're like, "Who are you?" And I'm like, "How can I help you?</p><p>And what can I do to support you?" They need a new playground, they need this, they need that. And maybe they just need some support, moral support. But it's been a great thing to really anchor the company in those values, and I think it's an important thing for every company.</p><p>So what did you think when you saw that OpenAI started with a nonprofit, not as 1%, but as 100%, but then it became a for-profit? What did you think of that innovation? Confusing. I mean, 18,000 companies have now followed our 1-1-1 model. You can find out about it at pledge1percent.org.</p><p>That other model, I don't really understand. I think we've proven our model. This is important. You know, we came out with three models. The cloud model, which you also have been part of that, the subscription model, you've also been part of that, and the philanthropic model, and you've been part of that.</p><p>And those ideas that we're doing three models, that continues to be the fuel for the company and extremely important. And I think that for a lot of these companies that have followed us, that have gone on to scale and have had huge IPOs, and whether it was Slack or whether it was Atlassian or whether it was Etwilio or whatever, they've had these huge foundations and have had huge impact.</p><p>And business can be the greatest platform for change, and you can do a lot with your business. So we're all building great products. Okay. That's great. And we're selling them. That's great too. But we can also do a little more with our business, and we can use it in a positive way and try to move the world maybe a little bit more in the right direction.</p><p>Okay. So let's talk about the cloud part of that innovation. Where do you think we're at right now? I mean, is it all AI all the time? How are you thinking about it? We're at the precipice of the greatest moment in the history of enterprise software and of cloud computing.</p><p>There's no question. I had a moment, I would say, more than a decade ago, which I call my kind of AI freakout moment, where I really felt ... I mean, maybe it's ... Obviously, we've all spent ... How many of you watched Minority Report? All right. We saw that movie.</p><p>And what about War Games? War Games? Anybody remember that? Okay. Her. Yeah. Yeah. We all saw these movies. Terminator? Okay. That one's a little scary. But we've all seen the movies, and like Peter Schwartz, who wrote or was a key part of writing Minority Report and also War Games as our chief futurist at Salesforce.</p><p>And a decade, more than a decade ago, I had this moment where I was like, "Okay. This is really happening. Here we go." And bought a bunch of companies and put together Einstein, and Einstein has done amazing. It's doing trillion transactions, trillion and a half transactions a week, predictive, generative.</p><p>I really thought, "Okay. This is what's going to be the moment." But now I'm really convinced that we are now really at the moment, right now, where enterprise software is going to be completely transformed with artificial intelligence. And we're going to see it, and obviously, I'm getting tuned up for Dreamforce, which is going to be Tuesday of next week.</p><p>How many of you are coming to Dreamforce? Not enough. Anyway. Sad. These aren't my people. I'm leaving now. Well, it's good. Well, look. But no. Let me just tell you. This is an opportunity. Since you're not going to be there, let me tell you what's going to happen. Thanks for being part of my team.</p><p>Anyway, number one is we're going to ... We really see a moment right now where we are 100% focused on one thing and one idea, and I can tell you why that is if you're interested. But it's AgentForce. And AgentForce is the most exciting thing I have ever worked on in my career.</p><p>It's the culmination, really, of everything that we've done at Salesforce. Because to make AgentForce really deliver, we had to have all of our customer touchpoints wired up, which we do. We have to have an amalgamated data cloud, because we need the data especially to achieve the AI accuracy, and the metadata as well.</p><p>And we have to have the agents. It's these three layers that are really going to deliver this next generation capability. And I was just with Disney last night, and Disney has AgentForce. They have the newest version, which we call Atlas, which is our most accurate, not just model, but we have an extremely unusual technique that we'll talk about.</p><p>And Atlas delivers for Disney, for their cast members, which are their employees, through extremely complex problems that it's solving for them. More than 90% accuracy and almost no hallucinations, and in some cases, 95% accuracy and almost no hallucinations. And that idea that we can kind of come in to a very difficult and complex and sophisticated dataset.</p><p>Now, with Disney, if you go to DisneyStore.com, that's Salesforce. If you go to the Disney parks, do you still go to Disneyland? Sometimes, yeah. Okay. You ever get a Disney guide? Sometimes. Yeah. It's great, because you get to cut around the lines and all that. How many of you have done the Disney guides thing?</p><p>We've got a lot of poor people here, actually. Sad. Anyway, you should get these Disney guides, because they get you around the lines, and you've got to do 30 rides a day, and it's much better than having to wait. Okay. But anyway, Disney guides run on Salesforce, they have Slack, too.</p><p>We do DisneyStore.com. We have Disney+, because the service now fell over, and we had to replace that inside the Disney+ call center. We do the Disney cruises, and the Disney real estate, and we have every Disney customer test point all wired up. So the amalgamated dataset that we have around Disney is awesome.</p><p>So when we can take that Disney dataset, and then we apply Atlas and AgentForce- Okay. So how do you define- How do you deliver a level of accuracy that has been incredible? And I've got a couple more examples, I can tell you, that are just blowing my mind. And I never thought it was really possible, but now it really is.</p><p>Go ahead. Yes. Well, I just wanted to find- Do you want me to ask you a question, also? No, no. No. What do you mean by agent? Because we're starting to hear this term a lot, but I think a lot of people here may not know what that means in the context of AI.</p><p>Yeah. Did you see the movie The Matrix? Yes, I did. Is that Agent Smith, or what are we talking about? Well, we're at some level, I mean, I think like, I'll give you an example that we're working with a large medical company not too far away from here, Kaiser.</p><p>They've got 20 million patients, they have a super complex dataset, they have all of the data from Epic, they have the largest Epic customer in the world. And more than 90% of all patient inquiries and scheduling requests and schedule my doctor, my CT scan, my MRI, my this, my that, are being resolved by AgentForce and Atlas.</p><p>That idea that we can resolve through a autonomous agent, a deep and complex customer interaction is a breakthrough thought. Obviously we have to do a few things to make it really work for our customers. Number one is, it's got to be trusted, because our customers, we're running the largest banks, sales companies, media companies, CPG companies, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah in the world.</p><p>Number two is, it's got to be easy for them. It can't be some separate team that they're going to spin up. It's their existing Salesforce team, it's happening within the Salesforce platform. It's got to be open, it has to be able to work with and interoperate with other systems.</p><p>It's going to have to be multimodal, so it's going to have to speak to them and have voice and video and do all of those kind of incredible capabilities. And one other key thing, because evidently the humans have not gone away. The doctors have not gone away from Kaiser, and the cast members have not gone away from Disney and on and on, so we're going to have to handshake seamlessly with our apps.</p><p>So even though we have all these apps and we've wired up all these customer touchpoints, the agents are autonomously interacting with and building the data and metadata and extending it. So by the end of this month, we'll have more than a thousand customers on our AgentForce platform. The efficiency and productivity that we've been had with AgentForce is like nothing I have ever seen with any of our customers or technology in the history of software.</p><p>But there's a second point, it isn't just about this kind of ease of use. It's that they have the ability to do things that are truly astonishing, and that is also generate revenue. So they can go out and like on a day like today, like it's a hundred and something degrees outside, I don't know if you've been out there, it's pretty hot.</p><p>And Disneyland may not be as full today as it's going to be, and they knew that was going to be true two days ago that a heat wave was coming. Disney can proactively go out to their consumers and their customers and say, "Hey, come enjoy the heat with us all, you know, at Disneyland, and we're going to give you a special promotion or price or contest or whatever it is to come to Disneyland." So we want to be able to proactively go out and generate revenue, and we also want to be able to kind of bring that customer service in.</p><p>I think last night I had dinner at Beverly Hills at the Grill. Have you been there? Great, right? Cream spinach? I don't know. I did something different. What do you want? What do you prefer? Well, I like potatoes. Potatoes, okay. You know, any kind of potato. Any kind of potato.</p><p>Baked potato. Steak fries. So I'm on OpenTable. Right? Anybody here use OpenTable? Nice. It's a nice group. It's a very weird group. Anyway, you can use OpenTable to make restaurant reservations, and there's 160 million consumers on OpenTable. They're not in this room, but they're somewhere, and they've got also 60,000 restaurants, and they've got a lot of complex issues, you know, in regard, you know, I didn't get my table or my food wasn't right, my potato didn't get cooked, whatever it is.</p><p>These things are going to get worked out, but also, all of a sudden, the restaurant's like, "Oh, look, we're not as full tonight as we want to be, and we're willing to do, let's go out to our customer base and bring them in, but let's do it through a complex conversation, you know, an empathic conversation as an agent with our customers." I think it's going to be a rocket ship.</p><p>Okay, so how long will it be until when you call a customer support center, you're talking to an AI that sounds like a human and you can't tell the difference? Are we there yet? We're there yet. We are already at that point. We already have that live, and we will have that scaled for thousands of customers before the end of, live for, with thousands of customers live before the end of this year.</p><p>And we just, I just demoed it, I was just at a conference and spoke a couple miles away from here at KPMG, and we showed them that exact situation where, you know, through, you know, we used to call, you know, this kind of voice response system, whatever. But you would kind of hit a wall pretty quickly with your bot, you know.</p><p>But these aren't bots. These are not the bots you're looking for. These are like, we're really getting to, like, another level capability, and I think that it's pretty impressive. And I think in the example of Disney, you know, Google has some great products. I know Sergey was here yesterday, and they've done a great job with AI, as you know.</p><p>But in a head-to-head benchmark of Salesforce's agent force against Google's AI, we 2X them on accuracy. And the reason why, as we'll explain it next week, you know, it's a couple of things. Not only is there a next-gen models, but it's also new techniques involving next-generation retrieval augmented generation, RAG techniques that no one has seen before, and it's really incredible what's possible.</p><p>So you're kicking Google's ass. I'm cool with that. Well, they're a good partner, also, a customer, and I love them, but yeah, it's competitive. It's competitive. Let me keep building on this. We're trying to all make AI a little more accurate and a little few less hallucinations along the way.</p><p>Let me give the audience a little update about something we just heard at OpenAI. They just did a day where they brought in a relatively small number of investors and kind of gave us all an update on their product roadmap. And it sounds kind of similar, because everyone's moving in the same direction.</p><p>So there are three big takeaways. Number one was that they said that LLMs would soon be at PhD-level reasoning. Right now, it's more like a smart high school or college student in terms of the answers. We're going to be at the next level. Shortly behind that is agents, like you're talking about, and then third and closely related is that agents will have the ability to use tools, and a tool can be a website.</p><p>So if you think about it now, you've got this LLM. It's really smart. It's got, you know, it's like a PhD. You can give it an objective, it will break that objective into a list of tasks, and those tasks can include using other pieces of software. And thanks to things like OpenAI just launched the audio API, which developers can use.</p><p>It's in private beta. We have some companies using it. The LLM can now basically pretend to be a human, and, you know, it won't be hard to find a piece of software to enable a phone call. So you can imagine telling a personal assistant agent that, and it could be, you know, it could be OpenTable, that, "Hey, book me a dinner reservation at the grill." And it could place a phone call on your behalf and actually talk to the grill.</p><p>It could also go on OpenTable and just use OpenTable and book it, but if for some reason that didn't work, it could literally place a phone call on your behalf, and the person picking up at OpenTable wouldn't even know that your agent actually isn't a human, it's an AI.</p><p>But here's where I think it gets really crazy, is when the phone gets picked up on the other end, that could be an AI too pretending to be a human. So you could have two AIs pretend to be humans talking to each other and resolving tasks on your behalf.</p><p>And I literally, I think that's where it's headed. We're definitely moving in this direction, but there's a cautionary tale here. And I think that I'll just tell you the real-world experience with my customers and the problems that I'm trying to solve for them. I think in the last few years, what we've kind of heard, and, you know, some of it has come from OpenAI, but especially from Microsoft, that we're in this co-pilot world, and these co-pilots have universally failed.</p><p>The level of accuracy, the spillage of information, the lack of trusted environment, co-pilot has been a complete disaster. And that idea that this kind of amount of technology got released and sold into these very large customers, telling them that the promise of AI is here, but didn't do it in a trusted way, didn't do it with the level of accuracy, didn't do it with the level of security needed.</p><p>And one of the things that was interesting, because I was with one of the customers, trying to do this exact technique that you're talking about, which is a large telecommunications company in Seattle. And what this company did is take a model and try to-- One that we've heard of?</p><p>Nope. Okay. We're going to just tell you, training a model, retraining a model, building their own model. "Mark, we have to have our own models. We're going to DIY it. We're going to DIY our AI, and it's going to be awesome. Then we're going to write our own agents, and we're going to do this, we're going to do that, the other thing." And I'm sitting there, and I'm going through it, and whatever, and then I finally am like, "Now, show me your benchmarks, and show me all these different pieces." And you know, for them, it's a bit of a science project.</p><p>And I've seen this now with a number of our customers, that they're kind of DIY-ing their AI. And you know, DIY, I think it's fine if you're like Neil Young, and it's homegrown, and it's Canada, and it's Ontario. But this is not what you should be doing with your artificial intelligence.</p><p>But what are you guys using as your foundation model? Is it Lama 2? Like, what do you guys use for your foundation? We have a lot of our own models, our own techniques, our own... And then we let you bring in the model that you want, but we are all about achieving your accuracy.</p><p>Because what I've seen with these kind of approaches, especially the one that you just outlined, is that, yeah, you can get maybe 30 or 40% accuracy. You know, in this case, this customer is 25%. You had somebody on the stage yesterday, I won't tell who it is, he's a common friend of both of ours, who tried to take this approach for a large telecommunications company that he owns, and he said he was getting about a 25% accuracy with this homegrown model.</p><p>And I'm like, "Why are you doing that?" Instead, in our platform, the platform is building the model for you. You're not having to train and retrain your own models. You're building your own models in our platform, and we're gonna deliver much higher levels of accuracy for you, and we're gonna deliver AI.</p><p>This is the AI that you want. This is this next generation of AI, and I think that we'll have to prove that with benchmarks and with bake-offs, and to show customers. Because the promise is amazing, but at a very deep level, customers are gonna need, you know, what you and I have done for the last, you know, 20 years of our life, which is build professional enterprise software, and deliver it to them in a capability.</p><p>And in regards to an agent running enterprise software, I mean, you just saw, like, that was the fundamental business model of Adept, which was David Luan's company, you know, and that's, he built GPT-3, then he left OpenAI to start Adept, and this idea to build agents that are gonna drive apps.</p><p>I'm sure that all of those things are gonna happen, but again, you have to get to a level of accuracy, because everyone in this room, and you and I, we've all had this experience where we're on these models, and it's like, this is not really more than hallucinations, and that's no good, or as we say here in Los Angeles, no es bueno, when it comes to, okay, Kaiser, and you're dealing with healthcare.</p><p>You know, when you're dealing with healthcare, and you've got a patient, and you're reading their medical records, you better be delivering more than 90 or 95% accuracy, 'cause the 50% accuracy thing is no good. - Well, I can see you're ready for Dreamforce. - I'm trying to get, find it.</p><p>I'm testing material out here a little bit. - What do you guys think? - So, I'm like... - Are you guys excited for the rise of agents? Yeah? It's gonna be a really big deal. I think that everything we've seen so far with LLMs has been, again, about reasoning and generating, but with agents, the AI's gonna be able to take actions, and they're gonna know how to use tools, which, until now, it's been something only humans can do.</p><p>- I gotta tell you a really good story, because you're, like, inspiring me around, you know, Steve Jobs had a huge impact on my life, and I worked at Apple in 1984 when I was in high school, and coming into college, and I was in an assembly language program, and I wrote the first native assembly language on this Macintosh, on the 68000 assembler, and sitting there in the cubes, and Steve was running it, whatever it was, and thank God, you know, I had this relationship, and it influenced me so much in my life, and then called me on a series of times, and after I started Salesforce, gave me really key advice.</p><p>Anyway, it was 2010, and he calls me, and I was like, come down here, I need to talk to you. I'm like, shit, what the hell, what did I do this time? So I go down there to his office, and I always bring a few Salesforce employees with me, and I've got some great folks with me, and we're sitting there, and he's like, I'm gonna show you this, and I'm like, alright, let's go, and he brings out the iPad, and he's got two of them, he's got the big one and the small one, and he's like, yeah, Mark, here it is, but I don't like the small one, I'm only gonna have one size, you know that, and I'm like, yes, sir, and he's like, listen, you know, I've been working on this concept for a long time, and you know, in 2007, I introduced iPhone, and I said, thank you for sending me one, I love it, it's great, he's like, but do you know why now we're doing the iPad?</p><p>I'm like, no, because I know you had that, too, in 2007, oh, yeah, but you know what, the real situation here is that Apple, I'm like, what is it, Steve, he's like, we only have one A-team here, one A-team, so we're only focused on one thing at a time, and then he lays out, like, five or six products on his coffee table, and he goes, and we will never have more products than can fit on my coffee table, and I'm like, well, that's really awesome, and he's like, I've been focused on 2007 and the iPhone, and now I'm gonna zero in, and I'm only gonna do iPad, one focus at a time, remember that, Mark, that's the way you need to run Salesforce, and I'm like, okay, is that why you brought me down here?</p><p>Yes, you may go. And that's how I feel right now about AgentForce, this is all I am doing, just try to take our company, you know, we have a great company, 38 billion in revenue, 75,000 employees, hundreds of thousands of customers, and one focus, AgentForce, this is because of what you're saying, this is the moment, this is the greatest opportunity in the history of enterprise software, and it must be executed with absolute acuity and excellence, and that is what I think we all need to do.</p><p>You know, so I agree with you, I mean, I think the agents are gonna be huge, and Elon said something kind of similar to the other day, he said, we got him talking about Optimus, you know, his robot. I just heard about the farm animals, I didn't know about the, what was, was there another part of the presentation?</p><p>He said, well, he was talking about, he was talking about Optimus, and, oh, you, the thing about... These jokes are all, each one is kind of dying very fast, it's sad. It took me a second to realize that you were talking about his cock, but now I got it, okay.</p><p>So, he was referring to... It's great how you bring this humor into the all-in, yeah. It's very subtle sometimes, yeah. So what Elon mentioned that really stuck with me is he said that humanoid robots, the creation of these humanoid robots are the biggest economic opportunity in the history of the world.</p><p>The average person's... Is he making some of them by any chance? He is, but, well, it's kind of like you saying that agents are the biggest opportunity in the history of enterprise software. Thank you. Let me write that down. Thank you for letting me know that. It strikes me that there's something similar here, which is...</p><p>Elon is a good salesman. Is that your point? Well, I'm saying there's an analogy here between... He didn't give you the regenerative pitch. Is that my... Well, no. Here, the point is this, is that where we're going with AI is it's gonna be able to take real actions, and in the case of Optimus, it's in the physical world, and it's gonna be the brain for these humanoid robots.</p><p>In the enterprise, it's basically the brain for these agents. I think these things are actually pretty... They're on parallel tracks. I wouldn't say they're competing, and so my point... These are the droids you're looking for. So I think... Anyway, I think that... I think you're right about this opportunity, and what I'm saying is I think it's analogous to what Elon is seeing with robotics.</p><p>I think there's no question, and I think that for our customers, they're gonna augment their employees. They're gonna make things lower cost. They're gonna increase their revenues. They're gonna increase their margins. We're gonna take some customers and just turn them into margin machines, and I think that the opportunity in the enterprise is unbelievable.</p><p>He's also directly addressing the consumer market, which I think is very exciting. Obviously, he's an expert in that area, and yeah, we're about to move into this new world of AI, of droids, of all these things, and it's a bunch of waves of... Look, technology is getting lower cost and easier to use.</p><p>It's a continuum, and we're all riding that continuum. This is extremely important, but also what's very important is, especially as we move into this, we all have to think about what are the values that are gonna guide this technology? Because each of us have seen the movies. We all watch the movies.</p><p>That was the one place where I got the hands to go up, right? So we know how it can go really wrong, right? Everybody saw that part of the movie. So what are the values? What's gonna be really important to us? Will it be trust? Will it be customer success?</p><p>Is it innovation? Is it quality? Is it sustainability? What are the values as we guide into the next level of the future? Because those core values that we need to manifest and really focus on, that is, I think, still out there as a major discussion item. It's gotta be figured out, and that is why we're very lucky that you are one of the great visionaries of our industry, because you're not just a great entrepreneur and CEO, but you're a great human being.</p><p>So thank you, Mark. Thank you. (audience cheering and applauding) - Thank you. (audience applauds)</p></div></div></body></html>
