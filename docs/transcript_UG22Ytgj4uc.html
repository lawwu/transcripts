He never quite pulled himself together as a human being. And as is true with many people with that kind of personality structure, he was a superb actor. He could play lots of different roles and he did.</p><p>Women adored him. He was one of the most lavish quarters of women. He would bring a bouquet of flowers to their first date, which was apparently shocking to people in those days. He was just a lovely courtly man. But in the classroom, if somebody made a stupid mistake, he would just chew them out.</p><p>And he was nasty to people all the time in a way that bothered a lot of people. Louis Alvarez, who was someone I got to know pretty well because I helped him write his memoirs, and one of the important scientists at Los Alamos really didn't get along with Oppenheimer at all because Oppenheimer was so condescending to everyone.</p><p>And Louis was kind of a hothead in him, like people condescending to him. Oppenheimer never won a Nobel, Louis did, and so forth. So there was this layer of Oppenheimer being waspish all the time, which was his insecurity. And his insecurity extended to physics in that rather than dig deep into one problem, Robbie said later, he just, he didn't have the zits flash.</p><p>He couldn't sit down and focus on one problem because he always wanted to be someone who always knew everything that was going on in physics. Well, you could call that someone who was a very sophisticated, knowledgeable scientist, or you call him someone who was superficial, and he was superficial.</p><p>He knew broadly rather than deeply, if you will. And for the period of the war, Hans Bethe told me this. He said, "Before the war, Robert really could be cruel. He would pounce on a mistake you made." And Bethe, Nobel Laureate of, Bethe discovered what makes the sun work.</p><p>That's how important Bethe's work was and how significant. Bethe told me, and of course, everyone makes mistakes. I made mistakes. Oppenheimer would charge me with a mistake if I spoke wrong. But he said, "Before the war, after the war, but not during the war." During the war, he was the superb kind of wise lab director because unlike most scientists, he was not only a physicist of high class, but he really was psychologically astute as a human being, as I think insecure people often are because got to scope out what's going on.</p><p>When the war was over, these were mostly graduate students or new PhDs who had been recruited for this program. The average age at Los Alamos was 27. Oppenheimer was an old guy. He was 39, right? So these were young guys who'd been pulled out of their lives, pulled out of their careers.</p><p>They wanted to get back to the university and do the work they had started out to do. And by and large, they did and Los Alamos just emptied out. Teller was horrified. Teller wanted the bomb program to continue because he wanted to build his hydrogen bomb. It was going to be his bid for history, just as Oppenheimer's bid for history was the fission bomb, if you will.</p><p>Teller's was going to be the hydrogen bomb. - You talked to Teller in writing the book, is that right? - I did. - What was his feelings when you talked to him about this? - I made the mistake of going to see Teller at his house on the grounds of Stanford University early on in my research when I really didn't have as clear a grasp of who everyone was and what I should ask and so forth.</p><p>And I sent him a copy of a essay I'd written about Robert Oppenheimer for a magazine and that set him off. He had reached the point where he was telling TV interviewers asking them how much time he would actually be on the air. And if they said three minutes or whatever, he would say, all right, then I will answer three questions, no more.</p><p>Trying to control because he was convinced that everyone was cutting the story to make him look bad. He really had quite a lot of paranoia at that point in his life. So when he read my essay on Oppenheimer, he used that as the basis for basically shouting at me, waving my big, heavy book, one of my big, heavy books at him.</p><p>I remember thinking, oh my God, he's going to hit me with my book. Then I thought, wait a minute, this guy's 80 years old, I can take him. So, but he finally said, all right, I will answer three questions. And we sat down and I asked him one and he didn't give me an interesting answer.</p><p>Asked him the second question and it was worth the whole interview. I said, was Robert Oppenheimer a good lab director? And I thought, well, here's a chance where he'll slash him. But his worst, Oppenheimer's worst enemy said to me, Robert Oppenheimer was the best lab director I ever knew.</p><p>And I thought, bingo. And then he chased me out of the house. You know, Eisenhower in one of his memoirs says, I always liked Hannibal best of all the classical figures in the military of the Roman empire, because he comes down to us only in the written memoirs of his enemies.</p><p>And if they thought he was such a good leader, he must've been a hell of a leader.</p></div></div></body></html>
