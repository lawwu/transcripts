So that's the heavy part of Grok 4.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbgL00a7_xs&t=392" target="_blank">00:06:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, long-standing followers of the channel may note that that is the exact premise of Smart GPT that I released</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbgL00a7_xs&t=400" target="_blank">00:06:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">around 18 months ago, which scored at the time a record performance on the MLU, 89%. Ironically, that exam was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbgL00a7_xs&t=408" target="_blank">00:06:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">also authored by Dan Hendricks, who is the lead author of Humanity's Last Exam. And yes, I can't resist plugging that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbgL00a7_xs&t=415" target="_blank">00:06:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Andrei Karpathy shouted out Smart GPT. One last thing on the benchmark that many might have missed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbgL00a7_xs&t=420" target="_blank">00:07:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">is that the text-based performance of Grok 4 and Grok 4 Heavy is extremely good. But on the full benchmark,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbgL00a7_xs&t=426" target="_blank">00:07:06.760</a></span> | <span class="t">it's a more modest improvement over, say, Gemini 2.5 Pro. So Grok 4 must do really quite badly on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbgL00a7_xs&t=433" target="_blank">00:07:13.800</a></span> | <span class="t">visual segment. In other words, you might not want to rely on it for decoding Roman inscriptions. Which brings</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbgL00a7_xs&t=439" target="_blank">00:07:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">me, of course, to Super Grok Heavy for $3,000 a year or $300 a month. XAI are promising new features</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbgL00a7_xs&t=449" target="_blank">00:07:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">will come to Super Grok Heavy like video generation in October. But Gemini Ultra for a lower price already</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbgL00a7_xs&t=458" target="_blank">00:07:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">has VO3. Now, if your pockets are deep enough, you'll just subscribe to everything. But if this is your only</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbgL00a7_xs&t=465" target="_blank">00:07:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">maxed-out subscription, it's hard to look past the much cheaper $20 Gemini Pro. Let me know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbgL00a7_xs&t=470" target="_blank">00:07:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">of course, in the comments if you think it's worth this amount and why. I'm open to being persuaded.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbgL00a7_xs&t=477" target="_blank">00:07:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I just don't see it at the moment. Just quickly, if you're a developer, you'll note that Grok 4's pricing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbgL00a7_xs&t=481" target="_blank">00:08:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">is at the same level as Claude 4 Sonnet. $3 input, $15 output, which is a decent price for a Frontier</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbgL00a7_xs&t=488" target="_blank">00:08:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">model. Again, there are much cheaper alternatives. Next, if you did watch the live stream, of course,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbgL00a7_xs&t=494" target="_blank">00:08:14.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Musk mentions repeatedly that they have new features and new models coming soon and that Grok 5 may be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbgL00a7_xs&t=501" target="_blank">00:08:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">finishing training imminently. However, we also get leaks this week that Gemini 3 is coming and,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbgL00a7_xs&t=507" target="_blank">00:08:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">of course, perennial leaks about GPT-5 coming this month. Now, it used to be the case that we would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbgL00a7_xs&t=513" target="_blank">00:08:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">then have to wait six months for the actual release of the model because of safety checks. Would a model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbgL00a7_xs&t=519" target="_blank">00:08:39.040</a></span> | <span class="t">help with creating a bioweapon, for example? But that all seems to have gone out of the window at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbgL00a7_xs&t=523" target="_blank">00:08:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">moment. Which brings me to this fairly wild quote from Musk on safety.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbgL00a7_xs&t=528" target="_blank">00:08:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, let's be bad or good for humanity. It's like, I think it'll be good. Most likely it'll be good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbgL00a7_xs&t=535" target="_blank">00:08:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Yeah. But I somewhat reconciled myself to the fact that even if it wasn't going to be good,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbgL00a7_xs&t=543" target="_blank">00:09:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I'd at least like to be alive to see it happen. So, you know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbgL00a7_xs&t=548" target="_blank">00:09:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Next, and you might have been wondering when I was going to talk about this, but yes, of course,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbgL00a7_xs&t=556" target="_blank">00:09:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Grok 4 may suffer at times from a similar issue to Grok 3 in that it seems to get sudden urges to praise</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbgL00a7_xs&t=564" target="_blank">00:09:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">certain historical figures or focus on a country, for example, South Africa. That behaviour seems to have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbgL00a7_xs&t=570" target="_blank">00:09:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">been caused by this addition to Grok 3's system prompt, which is that its response should not shy away from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbgL00a7_xs&t=577" target="_blank">00:09:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">making claims which are politically incorrect.

System prompts aren't, of course, the only issue for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbgL00a7_xs&t=589" target="_blank">00:09:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">XAI, they are apparently burning through one billion dollars a month.
