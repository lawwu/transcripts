141, verse 2 says, "Let my prayer be counted as incense before you and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNYK17fp9r0&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And Paul says in 1 Timothy 2, 8, "I desire then that in every place men should pray,

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNYK17fp9r0&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.500</a></span> | <span class="t">that if his hands are in the air in his prayer, they better be holy hands.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNYK17fp9r0&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And let me mention one other cultural factor and a closing word of personal things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNYK17fp9r0&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I was talking to a church leader outside America once who tried to explain to me that lifting the hands in worship in his city was a badge of bad theology.</span></div><div

wrong things and that he felt it would be a compromise in faithful churches if the people raised their hands.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNYK17fp9r0&t=364" target="_blank">00:06:04.500</a></span> | <span class="t">They'd be waving the flag of false teaching.</span></div><div class="c"><span

an outsider and you walk into a cultural situation you don't know anything about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNYK17fp9r0&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.500</a></span> | <span class="t">However, I suggested to him that there's probably a better way to distinguish ourselves from false teaching than by letting the false teachers co-opt a beautiful biblical practice as their own while the true church goes without it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNYK17fp9r0&t=396"

raiser, I would just say to those who don't do it, for me, it is both a natural expression of inner admiration for God and an intensifier of inner exaltation as it finds expression in the body.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNYK17fp9r0&t=460" target="_blank">00:07:40.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And I hope that those who don't
