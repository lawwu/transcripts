That means the electrolytes, sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=2528" target="_blank">00:42:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">all in the correct ratios, but no sugar.

The electrolytes, sodium, magnesium,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=2542" target="_blank">00:42:22.420</a></span> | <span class="t">and potassium are vital for the functioning of all the cells in your body, especially your neurons or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=2547" target="_blank">00:42:27.400</a></span> | <span class="t">your nerve cells.

And it sounds like everyone's addicted to something. And it's so hard to stay right in the, you know, between the lane lines of healthy and healthy. Because, yeah, I like... I'm not speaking for myself, because I'm not a drinker, but like, I like a drink at the end of the day. It helps me relax, makes me a better parent, makes me a better spouse, and I like it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=2622" target="_blank">00:43:42.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Is it my spiritual higher power? No, but I like it. Would I take 30 days off? Prefer not to, but I'm not addicted. You know, but then you think, okay, well, a kid that likes playing video games, it lets him connect with his friends. He's doing it a bit excessively, but is he addicted? You know, okay. Obviously, if somebody, if it's harming people's profession, it's harming their relationships in very overt ways, then we place into the category of addiction. But there's this thing that happens in these conversations around</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=2652" target="_blank">00:44:12.100</a></span> | <span class="t">addiction where people start to go, okay, it sounds like I can't really enjoy anything that much because then it takes over everything. Like, I'll come clean. I've worked anywhere from 10 to 16 hours a day, five to six days a week on average, kind of, since I was 19. Am I a work addict? Workaholic? Maybe, but I love my work and it's done wonderful things for my life. And I have a life that I wouldn't trade for anything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=2678" target="_blank">00:44:38.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Did I miss out on a lot of things? Probably. But I also love the life I've lived and that I continue to live. And a lot of that comes from the relationships and experiences I've had through work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=2692" target="_blank">00:44:52.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=2693" target="_blank">00:44:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, at some point, this is where diagnostic criteria become handy. But I do like the fact that we have a litmus test now. Could you take 30 days away from it and not completely lose your mind? Or could you just take 30 days away from it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=2707" target="_blank">00:45:07.400</a></span> | <span class="t">If I didn't work for 30 days, that would be very difficult for me, but I could do it. So how should we frame this thing of addiction? And so that people can ask themselves, like, do I have it? Or does it have me?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=2720" target="_blank">00:45:20.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. I mean, I think, how are you using it? And what is it impacting, if anything? But to be able to be honest with yourself about it. You know, it's very hard to be, it's easy to say, be honest with yourself about it. But it's very hard to be honest with ourselves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=2734" target="_blank">00:45:34.140</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, that's where being in relationship with others, sharing what you're experiencing. If you're taking 30 days off, really communicating to somebody else, whether it's a therapist or a trusted friend, you know, how am I thinking about this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=2747" target="_blank">00:45:47.900</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, am I waking up every day wishing I could be doing this other than something? Am I sitting in a business meeting completely dissociated from what's going on because I'm really focused on that I'm not gambling or that I'm not drinking?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=2761" target="_blank">00:46:01.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, you've got to be able to look at what it's impacting in the way that we're thinking and the way that we're feeling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=2769" target="_blank">00:46:09.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Can I ask you a question about how it's impacting things? Because one thing I've observed in myself and in others is that sometimes behaviors that if we were to just look at through a kind of tunnel vision, you'd say, wow, like this person just like works a lot or this person exercises a lot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=2788" target="_blank">00:46:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">It provides energy that feeds a bigger ecosystem, you know, gives me a sense of purpose, great relationships through my work and relationships that are not through my work, but, you know, it sits not as my higher power, but kind of at the center of my life and a bunch of other things wake out from it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=2806" target="_blank">00:46:46.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And to remove that thing would be to disrupt the whole web.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=2809" target="_blank">00:46:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that sometimes what scares people, especially, again, I don't, I can't relate to alcohol specifically, but what my friends who have made the decision to try and quit or quit drinking alcohol, for them, it's like their ability to socialize, the lack of anxiety while they're intoxicated, the knowing there's something to do for them as, you know, as opposed to like what they would fill that space with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=2832" target="_blank">00:47:12.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So sometimes I feel like these addictive behaviors fit into a larger ecosystem so that it masks the, any dysfunction, but it's, but it has this, again, gravitational pull so that, you know, it gets to bigger questions of like, how, how are we supposed to live our life?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=2849" target="_blank">00:47:29.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And I like this quote from St. Augustine, you know, that a life well lived is a constant reordering of our loves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=2855" target="_blank">00:47:35.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Reordering of our loves, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=2857" target="_blank">00:47:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=2857" target="_blank">00:47:37.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Something like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=2858" target="_blank">00:47:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So it gets to these questions of like, what, what is a good life?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=2861" target="_blank">00:47:41.180</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a great discussion point, you know, that, you know, people will come and say, I just want to be happy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=2867" target="_blank">00:47:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I just want to be at peace.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=2868" target="_blank">00:47:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">First thing we have to ask them is, what does that mean?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=2871" target="_blank">00:47:51.260</a></span> | <span class="t">We have to define it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=2872" target="_blank">00:47:52.260</a></span> | <span class="t">A lot of times, maybe they're saying that happiness is kind of the absence of all this bad stuff, you know, or that peace is, you know, everything outside of me is going okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=2882" target="_blank">00:48:02.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Everything is fine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=2883" target="_blank">00:48:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, we've got to really explore with them what, how would they know when they got there?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=2890" target="_blank">00:48:10.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, what a balanced life is going to be different for everybody.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=2894" target="_blank">00:48:14.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And especially like with behavioral addictions, you know, it's not about necessarily removing those forever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=2901" target="_blank">00:48:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, a lot of those we can't remove.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=2902" target="_blank">00:48:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Food addiction.</span></div><div class="c"><span

someone could not have sex, but really a lot of that is about connection and relationship and love and intimacy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=2914" target="_blank">00:48:34.380</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, even gambling, you know, people don't have to gamble, but you're dealing with money, you know, and you've got to touch it and spend it and be around it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=2922"

target="_blank">00:48:44.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, or a gamble sometimes as we've seen, you know, and we've got to look at how we're using these things, you know, and going back to drugs, you know, you look at like we've got pain medication, you know, aside from being abused, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=2942" target="_blank">00:49:02.600</a></span> | <span class="t">We've got opioid pain medication, and then we've got heroin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=2946" target="_blank">00:49:06.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And both of them either came from or derivatives of the poppy, which is a beautiful flower, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=2955" target="_blank">00:49:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So we've taken this flower and we've been able to make these drugs, and one of them, you know, of course, prescription pain abuse and fentanyl that we see is, you know, it can be deadly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=2967" target="_blank">00:49:27.700</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think an argument could be made that it's probably saved more lives than it's killed when used appropriately.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=2972" target="_blank">00:49:32.400</a></span> | <span

and I'm not going to know how to get there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=3451" target="_blank">00:57:31.760</a></span> | <span

got to – it starts with really knowing where I am, who and what I am.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=3458" target="_blank">00:57:38.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And from there, then, we can start to build a life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=3460" target="_blank">00:57:40.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So one of the things I give people a lot is once they kind of understand these assets and liabilities of theirs, you know, to look at each day ahead and say, you know, first we start off with gratitude.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=3474" target="_blank">00:57:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, it kind of gives a mindset.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=3475" target="_blank">00:57:55.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And gratitude just isn't about being thankful for things.</span></div><div

you know, that I always – when I give people this and when I practice it myself, I try at least to be – one of the things I'm grateful for to be something that I'm challenged by.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=3492" target="_blank">00:58:12.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And not just to say, I'm going to learn a lesson from this, but I might not know what that is, but to really express gratitude for some challenge I'm having.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=3502" target="_blank">00:58:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's kind of a mindset.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=3503" target="_blank">00:58:23.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the next thing is just laying out your plans for the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=3505" target="_blank">00:58:25.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And not like a detailed calendar, but like, you know, I'm going to wait, you know, take the kids to school, go to work, travel, you know, have a business dinner tonight, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=3516" target="_blank">00:58:36.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And then – so I kind of know what's happening that day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=3518" target="_blank">00:58:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And then from there, look at what are my – what's my emotional state currently?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=3524" target="_blank">00:58:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">What am I experiencing now?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=3526" target="_blank">00:58:46.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Especially if it's like fears, resentments, anger, guilt, shame.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=3530" target="_blank">00:58:50.080</a></span> | <span

class="t">It could just be like I'm feeling – I feel really solid today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=3533" target="_blank">00:58:53.640</a></span> | <span class="t">But when I can take what's going to happen today and what I'm already experiencing, I can look at what I'm doing today and think, you know, there are some character liabilities or defects that might come up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=3546" target="_blank">00:59:06.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Like if I have to travel today and I've got to take three flights instead of one, I can know that if I know myself, I might say I could – I have the ability to become impatient, controlling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=3557" target="_blank">00:59:17.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And look at my day to say, almost predict what are the emotional disturbances that can happen that day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=3564" target="_blank">00:59:24.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And then coupled with the state that I'm in, if I'm already upset about something else, I've got a higher likelihood of going into these reactive patterns that I don't necessarily want to go into.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=3575" target="_blank">00:59:35.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, much like going on a trip where I would look and see what the weather is going to be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=3581" target="_blank">00:59:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, if it's going to be – looks like it's going to be rainy the whole time I'm there, I'm going to pack a raincoat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=3584" target="_blank">00:59:44.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, that doesn't mean I'm not going to get wet, but once I start getting wet, I can go get my raincoat and put it on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=3592" target="_blank">00:59:52.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Same thing in this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=3593" target="_blank">00:59:53.580</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, the last part of it is to look for what I'm going to watch for because of my plans and my emotional state.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=3601" target="_blank">01:00:01.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I know that I have to watch for being like maybe short or controlling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=3605" target="_blank">01:00:05.940</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to watch for these character defects or liabilities.</span></div><div

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=3610" target="_blank">01:00:10.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to strive for being patient, tolerant, kind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=3614" target="_blank">01:00:14.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, just because I write this down just like the rain jacket doesn't mean I'm not going to experience these things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=3619" target="_blank">01:00:19.460</a></span> | <span class="t">But when I can look at like a day as an example, I can break it down in a chunk where, you know, I'm not going to be shocked by I'm being impatient.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=3630" target="_blank">01:00:30.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And as soon as I get impatient, I can remember, oh, this is what I'm looking – this is what I want to watch out for today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=3636" target="_blank">01:00:36.140</a></span> | <span class="t">What do I need to – and I wanted to strive for being tolerant and patient.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=3639" target="_blank">01:00:39.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So then I can, you know, use one of the tools that I might have that I've laid out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=3643" target="_blank">01:00:43.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, it might just be if I'm in the airport, walk away, take a breath, you know, and recognize and remind myself this is what I'm striving for today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=3652" target="_blank">01:00:52.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And in this exercise, we're putting out in front of us what we might be experiencing based on what we know about ourselves and what we've learned about ourselves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=3663" target="_blank">01:01:03.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And when we can do that, you know, we can start living each day a little bit better, or at least I find this with my clients, that they can chunk it down and say, you know, they're not surprised by these emotional reactions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=3677" target="_blank">01:01:17.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, like I said earlier, we want to help people – I try to help people learn how to feel bad, you know, to recognize that, okay, I'm feeling disturbed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=3687"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=3690" target="_blank">01:01:30.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And we run away from it in different ways.</span></div><div class="c"><span

that now I just totally withdraw and don't say anything?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=3701" target="_blank">01:01:41.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, numbing out is very common nowadays.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=3702" target="_blank">01:01:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I just want to repeat these different categories.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=3706" target="_blank">01:01:46.620</a></span> | <span class="t">A small list of gratitudes, including perhaps some things that we're grateful that challenge us or things that we've received or whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=3717" target="_blank">01:01:57.500</a></span> | <span class="t">It happens to be a quick list of gratitudes planned for the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=3721" target="_blank">01:02:01.700</a></span> | <span class="t">What the internal emotional weather is, like how am I feeling, irritated, rested, whatever, it could be three or four things, what to watch for, and what to strive for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=3729" target="_blank">01:02:09.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I do think it's an extremely useful, obviously zero cost, minimal, minimal time investment protocol, for lack of a better word, that everyone, not just people who struggle with addiction, but everyone can benefit from.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=3745" target="_blank">01:02:25.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Because I think we tend to be so conscious of, like what to look for, what to strive for, coming out of a morning journaling or a great night's sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=3756" target="_blank">01:02:36.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But then, you know, it's amazing how by 3 p.m. somebody cuts us off in traffic or, you know, or we're being bombarded with too many things and all of a sudden we're not necessarily unpeeled, but we're not our best self.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=3767" target="_blank">01:02:47.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you think there's value in sharing your list with somebody else?</span></div><div

I share something like this that's vulnerable with them, because it's not just about holding me accountable, but now I'm expressing it in a way that others see it, and we can have communication with them about, you know, having them share it back with you too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=3790" target="_blank">01:03:10.700</a></span> | <span class="t">I have like 10 guys that I share this with every day, you know, and not that the way that I do things is the way that everybody should, but I ask other people that I give this to to share it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=3798" target="_blank">01:03:18.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Because, you know, you're now expressing it, and expressing something kind of brings it more into existence than if I'm just doing it myself internally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=3810" target="_blank">01:03:30.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And we've got to put these things in front of us because we will forget very quickly, you know, or like you said, coming out of a morning journaling or meditation session feels great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=3819" target="_blank">01:03:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I think most people decide to make a change and then, you know, on one day, and then they don't think about it again in the way that they thought about it for months.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=3828"

going after, what's important to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=3838" target="_blank">01:03:58.140</a></span> | <span

or whatever, but I just don't believe those thoughts because I've had the experience thousands of times of then going back to sleep, waking up in the morning and being like, that's ridiculous.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=3870" target="_blank">01:04:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It doesn't, it doesn't,

class="t">And, you know, I'll preface this by saying I think I believe one of our biggest, if not our biggest challenge as human beings in our psychology is that we confuse discomfort with threat and respond to discomfort as if it's threat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=4465" target="_blank">01:14:25.620</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">01:14:41.620</a></span> | <span class="t">It says that the person was exposed to – it's like exposed to death, threatened – actual or threatened death or actual or threatened violence or actual or threatened sexual violence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=4494" target="_blank">01:14:54.620</a></span> | <span

<span class="t">And what that means is, you know, we can have a similar or exact reaction to something that is actually happening, like you're attacking me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=4508" target="_blank">01:15:08.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Hopefully, you're not going to attack me, but like you were, as if you

the heart of addiction but also at the heart of a challenged life, challenged in the ways that life shouldn't be challenging, is this lack of distress tolerance.</span></div><div class="c"><span

experience distress to know how to navigate distress.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=4599" target="_blank">01:16:39.620</a></span> |

does allow us to experience something and stay a little bit longer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=4666"

you've had a lot of people – we actually – I was at your home a couple years ago and there was a guy who was doing it for the first time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

translate to fear or distress, can translate when it comes in real time for something that we – that I know I can walk through this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

bunch of science nerd speak for the stress response is always an increase in autonomic arousal or alertness, a shrinking of the visual field, an increase in heart rate, a tendency to move.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=4725" target="_blank">01:18:45.620</a></span> | <span class="t">People will say, "But I

very fast, your forebrain, which is involved in all your contextual decision making and clean, clear strategies of what best to do, is essentially shut down for about 20 seconds.</span></div><div

very adaptive approach,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=4851" target="_blank">01:20:51.620</a></span> | <span class="t">because then your forebrain comes back "online" and you can really start to make strategic decisions based on those particular circumstances.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

I've learned is that there are sensations in the body that come about, and it will be different for different people, but there are sensations in my body that come about very fast because the adrenaline response is fast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5086" target="_blank">01:24:46.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And the more that I pay attention to those, the more I'm able to pick up on them at earlier stages of the stress response, kind of like seeing a big wave coming from further out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5098" target="_blank">01:24:58.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And the yogis talked about this.</span></div><div

meditation, we can start to see the quote, it's mystical language, but that like the subtle ripples of our perception.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5110" target="_blank">01:25:10.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Whereas when we're going through life and we're just kind of around, it's like being on a train and we're just seeing stuff go by all the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5115" target="_blank">01:25:15.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that the concept is stilling leads to seeing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5118" target="_blank">01:25:18.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I love that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5119" target="_blank">01:25:19.620</a></span> | <span class="t">The more that we can still the mind, the easier we can see what's actually happening versus what we perceive as happening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5127" target="_blank">01:25:27.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So what you say is so true that it is hard if the first step is to, after we recognize that this is something happening, is to stop when we're in the middle of response.</span></div><div

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5139" target="_blank">01:25:39.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Something that I work with the people and I actually heard you talk about in a different way that I really appreciated in one of your essentials podcasts where, you know, in that moment, when we're in that reaction, you know, the sympathetic nervous system has been activated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5158" target="_blank">01:25:58.620</a></span> | <span class="t">The solution though is not to deactivate the sympathetic, it's to activate the parasympathetic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5165" target="_blank">01:26:05.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So our practices and tools that I think are the most beneficial is how do we activate the parasympathetic?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5175" target="_blank">01:26:15.620</a></span> | <span class="t">A great question to ask ourselves once we recognize that we're in some sort of stress response, I like to tell people to ask, is am I or is anybody around me in immediate physical danger?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5190" target="_blank">01:26:30.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And if the answer is no, first off, if I can ask that question, it's probably the answer is no.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5194" target="_blank">01:26:34.620</a></span> | <span class="t">But most of the things that we experience every day are not life threatening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5198" target="_blank">01:26:38.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Actually, probably the thing that we experience every day that's most life threatening that doesn't bother most of us is driving in a car, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5204" target="_blank">01:26:44.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, we're hurtling down the road and just trusting that someone's not going to cross over that other line.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5210" target="_blank">01:26:50.620</a></span> | <span

class="t">But, you know, getting someone that you're in a committed relationship with or that you're emotionally attached to that says something you don't like might throw you into a spiral.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5224" target="_blank">01:27:04.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, it speaks to the unbelievably powerful aspect of human connection.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5230" target="_blank">01:27:10.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, likewise, with the earlier example of the kid in video games, we think about this kid and the video game as like the only players in the interaction.</span></div><div

remove him from his social context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5246" target="_blank">01:27:26.620</a></span> | <span class="t">We

of it if they did something really terrible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5259" target="_blank">01:27:39.620</a></span> | <span

really.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5278" target="_blank">01:27:58.620</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, if we were out in the jungle or back when we were nomadic and we still have that within us, that we need that connection.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

hopefully create more of a gap.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5306" target="_blank">01:28:26.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And of

target="_blank">01:28:29.620</a></span> | <span class="t">But as you were saying, with the behavior or the substance is the medicine against discomfort.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

our nervous system that is kind of binary and looking at its life or death.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5378"

a car about to hit me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5419" target="_blank">01:30:19.620</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, it

target="_blank">01:30:25.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it becomes so hard because we're in this kind of, I believe this fight in our, in our nervous system to say one part of it saying you need to act or you're not going to be okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5437" target="_blank">01:30:37.620</a></span> | <span

tool for a number of reasons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5546" target="_blank">01:32:26.620</a></span> | <span class="t">But how did you start incorporating this into trauma and addiction treatment?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5550" target="_blank">01:32:30.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I was working at a place in central Florida and near there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

who had come over from India in the 50s or 60s.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5568" target="_blank">01:32:48.620</a></span> | <span

there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5585" target="_blank">01:33:05.620</a></span> | <span class="t">That opened a door for me to start doing some other things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5588" target="_blank">01:33:08.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I had

target="_blank">01:33:12.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I got introduced to, to Yoga Nidra.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5595" target="_blank">01:33:15.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was just a very powerful tool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5598" target="_blank">01:33:18.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And in these workshops that I was in, I saw some pretty amazing things happen for the people that were taking trainings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5604" target="_blank">01:33:24.620</a></span> | <span class="t">We were there, you know, for, I remember we were, we were there for, it was a 10 day training and you could take it as 10 days or you could take five days and then come back for five days.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5616" target="_blank">01:33:36.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And there was a woman who had been there for a five day and was, was coming back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5621" target="_blank">01:33:41.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And when she was there at the first part, she had, she was a single mom.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5625" target="_blank">01:33:45.620</a></span> | <span class="t">She had two boys.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5627" target="_blank">01:33:47.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I, they were probably under 12 and she was completely stressed by them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5633" target="_blank">01:33:53.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Like completely stressed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5634" target="_blank">01:33:54.620</a></span> | <span class="t">She was, uh, could not almost handle being a mom.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5639" target="_blank">01:33:59.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And she practiced this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5641" target="_blank">01:34:01.620</a></span> | <span class="t">She decided to come to this training and then she went home and it was several months in between.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5645" target="_blank">01:34:05.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And when she came back, I remember in the opening like group, she shared that she'd gone home and had not changed anything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5652" target="_blank">01:34:12.620</a></span> | <span class="t">The only thing she did was practice yoga nidra.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5656" target="_blank">01:34:16.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, I think twice a day in the morning and the evening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5659" target="_blank">01:34:19.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And she's like, my boys changed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5661" target="_blank">01:34:21.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And I actually don't think the boys probably changed at all, but she was someone who was filled with anxiety and stress and the kids were picking up on that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5671" target="_blank">01:34:31.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And she wasn't able to tolerate the, the discomfort or distress of her children or boys just being boys.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5679" target="_blank">01:34:39.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't even think they were really probably behaving more than a, you know, an eight and 10 year old does differently, but she couldn't handle it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5685" target="_blank">01:34:45.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And now she was able to kind of build this, uh, distress tolerance by practicing this meditation, you know, and nidra means sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5697" target="_blank">01:34:57.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's a sleep based meditation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5698" target="_blank">01:34:58.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5698" target="_blank">01:34:58.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you want to just briefly describe what it looks like?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5701" target="_blank">01:35:01.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Generally what it looks like is first a person lays down and ideally they'd be laying on their back unless they, they can't lay on their back, but you, you, you lay on your back and get in a very comfortable position.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5711" target="_blank">01:35:11.620</a></span> | <span class="t">The, it's a guided practice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5714" target="_blank">01:35:14.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of the reasons it's guided is, uh, it, it, it's kind of becomes a technique that disappears the technique.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5721" target="_blank">01:35:21.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And what I mean by that is if you're sitting doing meditation and you're doing something where you have to focus on a mantra or which is not, this is not an exclusion of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5732" target="_blank">01:35:32.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, people, so, but when you're doing that, you kind of have to focus on that mantra.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5736" target="_blank">01:35:36.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So sometimes having to focus on something can, can bring you out of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5741" target="_blank">01:35:41.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And in those practices, bringing you out of it is beneficial too, because you want to be brought out of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5746" target="_blank">01:35:46.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you can find ways to get back into it, it being the, the, the meditative experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5752" target="_blank">01:35:52.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So you're, you're, you're laying down and there's generally, um, uh, a series of kind of, I'll say physical movements.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5759" target="_blank">01:35:59.620</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not like yoga doing stretching.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5761" target="_blank">01:36:01.620</a></span> | <span class="t">It might be something like tensing and relaxing your muscles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5763" target="_blank">01:36:03.620</a></span> | <span class="t">It might be something like massaging your face as you're being guided through this to kind of just relax the body.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5770" target="_blank">01:36:10.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And after a certain point, and in a lot of the, the teachings that when I do it, or I've been taught, there's a certain point at which all movement stops.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5779" target="_blank">01:36:19.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And you just want to follow the, you just, you're just instructed to follow the, the, the person's voice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5786" target="_blank">01:36:26.620</a></span> | <span class="t">In yoga nidra, we, or nidra, we set an intention, uh, like an intention might be like, I'm at peace with myself as I am in the world as it is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5794" target="_blank">01:36:34.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Something like that, something that you want to bring in or a state that you want to experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5800" target="_blank">01:36:40.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I know that you distinguish, I believe you distinguish non-sleep deep rest as like yoga nidra without intention.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5806" target="_blank">01:36:46.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Generally without intentions or mystical language.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5808" target="_blank">01:36:48.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5809" target="_blank">01:36:49.620</a></span> | <span class="t">It involves the, um, the, I think the most critical part of non-sleep deep rest and yoga nidra that, to me, the, the overlap in the Venn diagram as includes, um, self-directed relaxation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5822" target="_blank">01:37:02.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5823" target="_blank">01:37:03.620</a></span> | <span class="t">The ability to do that, which of course the incorporation of long exhale breathing will facilitate that because it pushes down on that, uh, side of the seesaw that is the parasympathetic nervous system and really gets it engaged regardless of how stressed you are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5837" target="_blank">01:37:17.620</a></span> | <span class="t">As you pointed out, getting that parasympathetic nervous system that, um, the idea that people's mind can be active, but their body is still, I think is a very powerful state.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5848" target="_blank">01:37:28.620</a></span> | <span class="t">You're not trying to fall asleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5850" target="_blank">01:37:30.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So the end goal is in reach for everyone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5852" target="_blank">01:37:32.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Yep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5853" target="_blank">01:37:33.620</a></span> | <span class="t">It isn't like you're going to fall asleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5854" target="_blank">01:37:34.620</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like, actually you're going to not fall asleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5856" target="_blank">01:37:36.620</a></span> | <span class="t">If you fall asleep, it's okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5857" target="_blank">01:37:37.620</a></span> | <span class="t">But, and actually sometimes people think they're asleep, but when I'm guiding them and I'll, I'll, I'll give a direction, like, you know, uh, to roll over on their, uh, on their side at the end and they do it, but they thought they were asleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5869" target="_blank">01:37:49.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So they were, they, what we believe is happening in that is they're in this, the, the brain states of sleep while still being awake.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5876" target="_blank">01:37:56.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Once they're in that relaxed space after doing some movement in the beginning or the space to be relaxed and still, I should say still versus relaxed still physically, um, is through breath, different breath exercises, specifically ones that have long exhales.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5894" target="_blank">01:38:14.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5895" target="_blank">01:38:15.620</a></span> | <span class="t">That's like you said, it activates the parasympathetic nervous system and then guiding them through their body in some way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5901" target="_blank">01:38:21.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So it might be, there's one called 61 points where you identify all these different points in the body, starting with the forehead down to the pit of the throat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5910" target="_blank">01:38:30.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And then all different parts from your shoulder down to your fingers, and then all the way down to your toes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5915" target="_blank">01:38:35.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And people being able to kind of move their awareness in their body kind of gets them away from that thinking and doing into the more feeling and being.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5925" target="_blank">01:38:45.620</a></span> | <span class="t">They're putting their awareness on their body rather than everything external.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5933" target="_blank">01:38:53.620</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the great strengths of doing NIDRA or NSDR, as it were, is that we take ourselves out of the prediction mode and we can experience life unfold in, in real time moments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5949" target="_blank">01:39:09.620</a></span> | <span class="t">It sounds so mystical, but actually it was Josh Waitzkin who was on this podcast, the former chess prodigy, um, martial arts champion, et cetera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5957"

to go through life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=5965" target="_blank">01:39:25.620</a></span> | <span class="t">One is metaphorically speaking as a passenger in the dining car on a train that's going 80 miles per hour and you're experiencing what's in that train and you're seeing things go by.</span></div><div

you want to be is strapped to the front of that train safely, experiencing space and time as they're happening, flowing by you and through you as a series of moments.</span></div><div class="c"><span

I always will say, it's like, you know, you're either on the back of the bus and you're being driven around or you're driving the bus, you know, it's not that you're just on.</span></div><div

these rails, experiencing it like this, that you have, uh, control autonomy and have the ability to be authentic and authentic in a way, not authenticity gets kind of thrown around.</span></div><div

am.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6047" target="_blank">01:40:47.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, most times when people are doing that and they're just acting, however, they're feeling in the moment, they're not who they are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6052" target="_blank">01:40:52.620</a></span> | <span class="t">They're who they were, or they're, you know, they're, they're acting out their past experiences.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6056" target="_blank">01:40:56.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Authenticity in the way that I'm talking is more like, uh, like auth is the same in author, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6062" target="_blank">01:41:02.620</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like authorship that you become the author of your life, you know, that you're able to write the story going forward because a lot of what we're doing before that is just plagiarizing from our past stuck in the cycles of our, uh, kind of programmed reactive patterns that came out of the ways that we were shaped.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6080" target="_blank">01:41:20.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And things like Nidra, where we can start to activate the parasympathetic nervous system, again, distinct from deactivating the sympathetic and be able to pause and be able to look at kind of choice, you know, in that cycle I was talking about earlier, where we're being reactive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6100" target="_blank">01:41:40.620</a></span> | <span class="t">The first thing is the stop. Well, how do we stop? It's by building these, these abilities to have this distress tolerance, even if it's for a few seconds and take a moment to be able to get present and look.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6112" target="_blank">01:41:52.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And what I mean by that is get, look, look at what's actually happening. This isn't every time someone sent me a text message and, uh, or every time someone's ever abandoned me or disappointed me, or every time I've been afraid, it's just this one moment where I get a text that says we need to talk later.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6128" target="_blank">01:42:08.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And from that, now that can break the cycle enough that I, instead of automatic reaction, I'm in choice and I'm making a choice out of kind of all options of how I'm going to handle this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6140" target="_blank">01:42:20.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, it might still mean that I go, could we talk about it now in a text response, but that would be very distinct from kind of sending 20 text messages in rapid recession, succession saying, what do you need? Why are you doing this? Am I in trouble?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6156" target="_blank">01:42:36.200</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, whatever it is we're saying, but you've been able to, to, to move to the front of the bus and now you're driving it, right? You're moving kind of out of, um, uh, you're being, uh, instead of being at the effect of life, you're being at, at cause.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6170" target="_blank">01:42:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I feel like most people learn how to control their body, but most people don't know how to control their mind, meaning they don't know how to control their thinking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6178" target="_blank">01:42:58.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. And there's a great line in a Indian text. It's called the, uh, Atma Gita, I think it is, where it says something like the, the, the end of the, it's like man thinks his enemy is out there, but really his, the man's uncontrolled mind is his only true foe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6196" target="_blank">01:43:16.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know if we need to garner complete control over the mind. I think the way to do that is to be able to kind of find ways to relax back from what the mind is doing and saying. And the, you know, like you said, ignoring the thoughts between two and five, you know, I think there's a lot of thoughts that we have that we can ignore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6216" target="_blank">01:43:36.300</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, our thoughts are not fact. It's this input or that I'm getting, and we tend to grab onto the thoughts that I think that we've had before that have helped us survive situations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6227" target="_blank">01:43:47.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Even if the way that we've survived those situations is to cause destruction. You know, we know how to live, you know, example would be someone who's in an abusive relationship again and again, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6239" target="_blank">01:43:59.500</a></span> | <span class="t">That person, I've never met that person that said, I can't wait to get into the next relationship. So it's abusive. You know, it could be a man or a woman in this case, let's say it's a woman, you know, maybe the only men that she was around growing up were controlling or abusive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6255" target="_blank">01:44:15.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And she had some experiences with men who were very similar. And then that's the environment or the waters that she started to swim in. She knows how to survive that kind of man, or if you're a man, that kind of woman.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6270" target="_blank">01:44:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And when they, they would find, even if they want that relationship, that's loving, caring, kind, and patient, no conflict, or not that type of conflict, even though they want that when they get into it, it doesn't make sense because they've never done it before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6284" target="_blank">01:44:44.040</a></span> | <span class="t">They're still going to be potentially relating to that person with these past reactive patterns. You know, I always say this when my wife and I've, you know, if you're in a relation, I, we have a great marriage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6297" target="_blank">01:44:57.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Great marriage also includes disagreement and argument, right? It also includes love and connection and all of that stuff. And when we're in an argument, it's almost like I'm not talking to her and she's not talking to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6311" target="_blank">01:45:11.160</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like my past is talking to her past and her past is talking to my past. When we can stop and get out of that cycle for just a moment, then we can make a choice that will move us toward the direction that we want to move.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6324" target="_blank">01:45:24.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And that choice can seem risky because if we haven't done it before, it goes against every, or let's say that that choice might go against everything that we've developed in order to survive the situations that we've come out of.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6338" target="_blank">01:45:38.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So now instead of arguing, I'm going to be vulnerable. That's going to feel very scary.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6344" target="_blank">01:45:44.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Laurie Gottlieb, a psychologist who was on this podcast and saying, and I totally subscribe to this, that people are more willing to stay in a bad situation often.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6358" target="_blank">01:45:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Something that's going to be able to stay in a bad situation, something that's not adaptive for them because it's familiar versus stepping into something that could be better for them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6366" target="_blank">01:46:06.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6366" target="_blank">01:46:06.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Clearly better for them, and they can understand that cognitively, but they somehow cling to what's familiar. I think that's just the way our nervous system is wired. Like you said, staying in the battles, repeating the battles that are familiar to us that we know how to win.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6381" target="_blank">01:46:21.820</a></span> | <span class="t">We just, instead of authoring something new, we're plagiarizing from our past just again and again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6387" target="_blank">01:46:27.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. I love that phrase, plagiarizing from the past, even though it's something to avoid.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6391" target="_blank">01:46:31.340</a></span> | <span class="t">How often should people do NIDRA or NSDR and at when, what time of day?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6395" target="_blank">01:46:35.980</a></span> | <span class="t">I think, I think I've told you this before, right? The first, probably the best time is to do something in the morning and in the late afternoon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6403" target="_blank">01:46:43.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Second best time would be in the evening and third best time would be anytime you, you can.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6410" target="_blank">01:46:50.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's not easy, you know, it could be anywhere from 20 to 35 minutes, right? So it's not easy for people to find that based on, find that time based on the schedules they have, but, you know, set a, set a time that you're going to do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6424" target="_blank">01:47:04.020</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, when we schedule and have proactive tools, we don't know if we're going to need them in that moment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6428" target="_blank">01:47:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">What it means is regardless of whether I need it or not, I'm going to do it. You know, it's kind of like I tell people with therapy and about therapy and coaching all the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6437" target="_blank">01:47:17.080</a></span> | <span class="t">If the second best time to get therapy is when you're in crisis, the best time is when you're not, that's when you can, we can grow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6445" target="_blank">01:47:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So scheduling proactively will allow us to either maybe solve a crisis that we're in or help us have the tolerance in that moment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6455" target="_blank">01:47:35.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Like I wake up stressed and I'm able to then do this, this practice and then I'm not stressed or I wake up not stressed and I'm able to do this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6462" target="_blank">01:47:42.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And it helps to build the ability for me to kind of drop back into that state because that's what I, I think as we practice things like yoga nidra, we're able to more quickly move from a dysregulated state to a regulated state.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6478" target="_blank">01:47:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know if you've had that experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6480" target="_blank">01:48:00.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Definitely. I think of stress and alertness and calm, all of it as the autonomic nervous system, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6487" target="_blank">01:48:07.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Parasympathetic being calmer states, sympathetic being more activated states.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6491" target="_blank">01:48:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think of it like a seesaw.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6494" target="_blank">01:48:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think, you know, when we're asleep, we're mostly parasympathetic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6499" target="_blank">01:48:19.580</a></span> | <span class="t">When we're very stressed, we're mostly sympathetic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6501" target="_blank">01:48:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's the balance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6502" target="_blank">01:48:22.340</a></span> | <span class="t">But the way I think about things like nidra is as a person on that seesaw, you are that person and you're learning to press on one side.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6512" target="_blank">01:48:32.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And when you're stressed, the hinge of that seesaw is very tight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6515" target="_blank">01:48:35.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's hard to activate the parasympathetic much more than when like you come out of sleep and you're still a little bit relaxed perhaps.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6521" target="_blank">01:48:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And then it's easier to push on that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6524" target="_blank">01:48:44.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So you might find that learning nidra is easier then.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6526" target="_blank">01:48:46.440</a></span> | <span class="t">There's always value to learning how to work both sides of the seesaw.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6532" target="_blank">01:48:52.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And actually, sometimes we need to know how to ramp up the level of stress, as in the case with the cold plunge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6537" target="_blank">01:48:57.780</a></span> | <span class="t">We're deliberately activating the sympathetic nervous system and we're saying, aha, but I'm doing it as this kind of person surfing on the seesaw.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6545" target="_blank">01:49:05.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I know how to balance here so that when I'm there again, I recognize this place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6549" target="_blank">01:49:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, so that's kind of how I think about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6552" target="_blank">01:49:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, and also I have found in practicing ognidra or non-sleep deep rest that it makes other practices easier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6560" target="_blank">01:49:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">That like when I want to do a five-minute meditation, you know, and one of the things that I think is super valuable for people is to set aside, you know, proactively schedule these times that you're going to do longer periods of rest or a practice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=6575" target="_blank">01:49:35.980</a></span> | <span

getting wasted, but I – you know, so I'll leave the wedding at 10 instead of 2.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=7029" target="_blank">01:57:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, most of the people thought I was there until 2, but I left at – I left at 10 because they're doing whatever they're doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=7036" target="_blank">01:57:16.760</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's very challenging because, you know, having a glass of wine at dinner or, you know, a beer after work or, you know, thinking about, you know, people – you know, there's like a – it was always a thing like the first time a dad and a son share a beer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=7052" target="_blank">01:57:32.400</a></span> | <span

| <span class="t">And alcohol, I don't think alcohol is evil.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=7059" target="_blank">01:57:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, I think listening to what you've talked about, it is poison, but I don't – like anything else in moderation, I don't think it's going to – it's a terrible problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=7068" target="_blank">01:57:48.940</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not

target="_blank">01:57:59.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think what – the good side of that being part of the culture is when people can find a community, like a 12-step community or some other sort of peer community where people aren't drinking, it can – you know, that is really what helps them a lot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

meetings are like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=7106" target="_blank">01:58:26.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, it's usually like they show a circle in a church basement and everybody is talking about how they can't drink that day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=7112" target="_blank">01:58:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm sure you've seen that in television, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=7115" target="_blank">01:58:35.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And in reality, of course, that happens sometimes, but most people are there really trying to use that program as a design for living and to build really amazing lives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=7128" target="_blank">01:58:48.300</a></span> | <span class="t">When you look at the 12 steps when it comes to alcohol, alcohol is only mentioned in the first one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=7133" target="_blank">01:58:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Everything else is about how you live your life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=7136" target="_blank">01:58:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, that first step is about admitting we were powerless and that our lives have become unmanageable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=7141" target="_blank">01:59:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And powerlessness is actually an awesome concept.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=7146" target="_blank">01:59:06.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, people will look at powerlessness and think that means I'm weak.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=7150" target="_blank">01:59:10.340</a></span> | <span class="t">That means I can't control my life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=7153" target="_blank">01:59:13.740</a></span> | <span class="t">But really, defining where you're powerless is the first step in finding great power.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=7159" target="_blank">01:59:19.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Because if I just keep going out every day and I start fighting a battle that I'm going to lose every single day, and even if it wasn't addiction, like every day I just go out and I am, you know, taking on the five biggest guys on the block when I'm a kid, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

doing it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=7180" target="_blank">01:59:40.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So go do something else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=7181" target="_blank">01:59:41.540</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, powerless, where we identify where we're powerless, then we can go find great power.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=7187" target="_blank">01:59:47.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's where the concept of higher power comes in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=7190" target="_blank">01:59:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And higher power to a lot of people is God and whatever their concept of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=7195" target="_blank">01:59:55.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes higher power is just the group of people and the community.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=7199" target="_blank">01:59:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I will see that anywhere from the relationship with God to, like, me and you talking is a higher power.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=7205" target="_blank">02:00:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Two heads are better than one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

reflect back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=7210" target="_blank">02:00:10.740</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to share with you, and you can reflect back to me and help me see things differently and shift a perspective.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=7215" target="_blank">02:00:15.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Because a lot of our healing is just a perception change.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=7219" target="_blank">02:00:19.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, I'm just going to see things a little bit differently than I did before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=7223" target="_blank">02:00:23.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So that community and the ability for them to be in service to each other and help each other is a – I think that's the antithesis of I'm part of this drinking culture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=7235" target="_blank">02:00:35.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's not only unique to alcohol, but because there's such that – you know, there's not usually like a socially acceptable – like, you don't see crack advertised on television, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=7248" target="_blank">02:00:48.500</a></span> | <span class="t">You see alcohol, and it's in everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8154" target="_blank">02:15:54.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Is there something unique to those addictions that you see in people that come in that give them kind of special requirements for how to overcome those addictions?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8161"

target="_blank">02:16:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I think in the, up until sometime in the 80s, and I'm not going to have this right, they didn't even, I think they didn't really see cocaine as addictive because you didn't become dependent on it like you would heroin or alcohol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8179" target="_blank">02:16:19.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Somebody wrote a book called, I think it was Dr. Gold, 1-800-COCAINE, where they were starting to see that we could classify addiction as a psychological addiction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8189" target="_blank">02:16:29.820</a></span> | <span class="t">I might have that a little bit off, but I think it's somewhere in that neighborhood.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8194" target="_blank">02:16:34.360</a></span> | <span class="t">There's not a physical detox from stimulants like amphetamines or cocaine like there is from heroin, opioids, or alcohol and benzodiazepines.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8211" target="_blank">02:16:51.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Coming off stimulants is really hard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8213" target="_blank">02:16:53.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It's really hard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8213" target="_blank">02:16:53.980</a></span> | <span class="t">It's really hard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8214" target="_blank">02:16:54.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Right, but it's, there's a obsession of the mind that gets triggered, and it's this, it's this psychological addiction that they can't seem to get out of.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8227" target="_blank">02:17:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I would imagine that you could probably describe it, what's happening with the huge surge in dopamine and then dropping off of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8232" target="_blank">02:17:12.700</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not sure exactly where it falls in that, but, you know, there's, they used to think that people couldn't, you know, recover from crack cocaine addictions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8243" target="_blank">02:17:23.380</a></span> | <span class="t">We were told, you do it once and you're addicted.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8245" target="_blank">02:17:25.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't want to say that's not true, but there was no real evidence for that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8248" target="_blank">02:17:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just smoking crack, aside from shooting cocaine, like intravenously, leads to the fastest increase in dopamine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8257" target="_blank">02:17:37.180</a></span> | <span class="t">It's the rate of increase is just as important as the peak.</span></div><div

that goes into just having them kind of still.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8266" target="_blank">02:17:46.680</a></span> | <span

ADHD.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8285" target="_blank">02:18:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, you, you probably

target="_blank">02:18:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, I know I've seen people that, that when they take stimulants, they get really calm.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

talk about some process addictions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8303" target="_blank">02:18:23.580</a></span> | <span class="t">These days, I hear a ton of really desperate stories, mostly from young guys.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8311" target="_blank">02:18:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I've heard from maybe four or five women on this, but literally thousands of young men about porn addiction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8319" target="_blank">02:18:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Every time I hear about it, I feel so fortunate that I grew up in a time where, or maybe I just don't have the wiring for it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8327" target="_blank">02:18:47.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And if I did, I would be, I'm pretty open on this podcast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8329" target="_blank">02:18:49.940</a></span> | <span class="t">It's never been an issue for me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8333" target="_blank">02:18:53.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And they're telling me that they can't stop watching porn.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8337" target="_blank">02:18:57.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I get the sense that they're not enjoying this experience anymore because they're reaching out to me saying, how in the world can I quit?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8346" target="_blank">02:19:06.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And what do I tell them?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8352" target="_blank">02:19:12.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I remember, and again, I don't know this study, but I remember somebody referencing many years ago when I was first getting in the field that porn addiction at the time, specifically related to video pornography, which is what it all is now, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8369" target="_blank">02:19:29.620</a></span> | <span class="t">It was having the same impact on the brain in young men as crack cocaine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8374" target="_blank">02:19:34.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, it's extremely powerful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8376" target="_blank">02:19:36.700</a></span> | <span class="t">It has a lot of other effects in that it sets up a very unrealistic idea and perspective of what sex and intimacy is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8386" target="_blank">02:19:46.780</a></span> | <span class="t">It also can help or can lead to kind of setting their sexual template.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8393" target="_blank">02:19:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">They can quickly escalate just like you would escalate kind of back to the hot fudge sundae where it doesn't work anymore from something that might seem like normal sex to violent sex to really out there things that can bring a lot of shame that they're even watching.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8416" target="_blank">02:20:16.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And it can escalate quickly and then have an impact on their own lives and relationships because they're playing out those relationships or that amount of intimacy, depending on what they're doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8427" target="_blank">02:20:27.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Also, if there's masturbation along with it in a fantasy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8432" target="_blank">02:20:32.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, what I'm also hearing is that anytime they are in a real life intimate scenario, which seems to be fewer and fewer times nowadays in the younger generation, that they're having sexual anxiety, sexual performance issues, which makes sense if their brain and nervous system is getting wired by porn to observe sexual behavior as opposed to being in the experience of intimate sex behavior.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8458" target="_blank">02:20:58.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. Two different things to be in the experience versus watching someone else's experience of it, which is what pornography is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8464" target="_blank">02:21:04.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. This was probably 10, 15 years ago where we're treating some, but we're treating a lot of soldiers that had come back from Afghanistan or Iraq.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8476" target="_blank">02:21:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, they had access, this was like the first wars where they had access to the internet and there's a lot of other things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8482" target="_blank">02:21:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So there was a lot of kind of combining of sex and violence, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8489" target="_blank">02:21:29.060</a></span> | <span class="t">They're around a lot of violence and then they're watching sex and then that kind of sexual template would set around like in order for them to get pleasure out of sex, it would need to be aggressive or even violent or very risky.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8503" target="_blank">02:21:43.220</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, so there's all these things that kind of collapse together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8507" target="_blank">02:21:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">There were other things going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8508" target="_blank">02:21:48.600</a></span> | <span class="t">It was like the first time that they had also really had access to video, uh, uh, video chats to be able to like be on a battlefield and then come back and be talking to their spouse about something that's going on with the kids.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8520" target="_blank">02:22:00.600</a></span> | <span class="t">It was very confusing environment for, uh, those guys and men and women, um, you know, the, the porn addiction is a, is a tough one, you know, because it, it's everywhere.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8537" target="_blank">02:22:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, now you can find it on any social media almost not, maybe not anyone, but it's not really limited, you know, and, and even if it's not, you know, I know certain states have just put in where you have to put in your ID to get it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8551" target="_blank">02:22:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's tons of ways around that and other sites that, that people can go to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8557" target="_blank">02:22:37.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And I've run into that with a lot of, it does seem to be young men, you know, and it's a way for them to play out some sort of fantasy around connection and relationship.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8568" target="_blank">02:22:48.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's, it makes their world really small.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8572" target="_blank">02:22:52.900</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think it's the same as gambling, but it can make it, it can make their world very, very small in that they're, instead of finding relationships out in the world, and it's not necessarily a relationship, but they're, what they believe they're getting out of a relationship, they're then getting out of watching porn.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8588" target="_blank">02:23:08.700</a></span> | <span class="t">It seems like basically stopping completely is the answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8593" target="_blank">02:23:13.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And people say, and I'm not trying to moralize here, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8596" target="_blank">02:23:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not telling people what's moral about this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8597" target="_blank">02:23:17.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I just know that any behavior or substance that leads to quick, repeated inflections in dopamine is going to create a groove in the nervous system where you're going to crave that thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8609" target="_blank">02:23:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's going to give you a lower and lower sense of satisfaction over time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8613" target="_blank">02:23:33.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And the only way to reset that circuit is to stop and do something else in its place, ideally, that's adaptive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8619" target="_blank">02:23:39.900</a></span> | <span class="t">These are people that are asking you how they can stop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8623" target="_blank">02:23:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, they're telling you, I can't stop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8625" target="_blank">02:23:45.580</a></span> | <span class="t">How do I do it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8626" target="_blank">02:23:46.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So it can be similar to other addictions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8629" target="_blank">02:23:49.940</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I mean, first, the admission part that it's a problem or awareness it is, and then being able to start to talk to somebody and start to take some accountability around it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8640" target="_blank">02:24:00.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Not accountability like you're doing something wrong, but to be able to have some sort of identify the behaviors that start leading to that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8648" target="_blank">02:24:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I mean, that can be done in therapy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8652" target="_blank">02:24:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">There's other 12-step groups that can help people with that to identify what their sobriety would look like, if you want to call it sobriety, what it looks like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8660" target="_blank">02:24:20.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And if it does involve not watching any porn, then that's the rule set that they have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8664" target="_blank">02:24:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And then they figure out either with their therapist or in their treatment center or with their sponsor or community in 12-step, like, how am I going to be held accountable to that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8676" target="_blank">02:24:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And that might be doing the things like we talked about, laying out, looking at your day ahead.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8680" target="_blank">02:24:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">At the beginning, they might need to look at things like, you know, there's ways and software out there to not be able to look at that on your phone or have an accountability partner that can, you know, you have to – they have to approve websites you go to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8693" target="_blank">02:24:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's not to say that they have to do that forever, but it's something that's available right – you know, 50 years ago or 30 years ago, someone had to, like, find their dad's porno mag somewhere and then look at it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8707" target="_blank">02:25:07.240</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, now it's on their phones or

accessibility – increasing accessibility increases addiction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8713"

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8718" target="_blank">02:25:18.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's some caveats that have to do with when you create areas within cities where certain things are allowed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8724" target="_blank">02:25:24.020</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, this has been tested many, many times.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8725" target="_blank">02:25:25.980</a></span> | <span class="t">It's also true and it's kind of a duh, but to quote Anna Lemke, it's impossible to get addicted to a substance or a behavior that you've never taken or engaged in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8734" target="_blank">02:25:34.780</a></span> | <span

best avoided entirely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8738" target="_blank">02:25:38.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Are there specific 12-step programs for porn addiction that are separate from, say, sex addiction?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8744" target="_blank">02:25:44.900</a></span> | <span class="t">If people look it up, I'm sure there's meetings out there that are specific to that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8748" target="_blank">02:25:48.520</a></span> | <span class="t">There are some treatment centers that have tracks that deal specifically with that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8752" target="_blank">02:25:52.720</a></span> | <span class="t">There's therapists that work very closely with that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8754" target="_blank">02:25:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And I believe that there are some 12-step – I mean, there's pretty much 12-step programs for any sort of – you know, within things like SA or SLA, there will be subsets of meetings for people that are with a very specific condition.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8766" target="_blank">02:26:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of the reasons I wanted to discuss this today is because I hear about it so much is unlike alcohol or drugs, there's a kind of extra layer of shame associated with pornography addiction for people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8779" target="_blank">02:26:19.160</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, so many times we've heard, oh, like this celebrity was an alcoholic or drug addict, you know, wrapped their car around a pole, was arrested, this and that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8788" target="_blank">02:26:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Then they get sober and everyone still loves them, loves them more, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8792" target="_blank">02:26:32.460</a></span> | <span class="t">If we knew that a given celebrity was like a porn addict or something, we look at that person differently.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8798" target="_blank">02:26:38.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8798" target="_blank">02:26:38.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Especially if they're male.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8799" target="_blank">02:26:39.880</a></span> | <span class="t">We just look at them differently.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8801" target="_blank">02:26:41.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And so reducing some of the shame around it I think is key to helping them recover.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8807" target="_blank">02:26:47.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Because I can tell you there's – the questions initially came in kind of like as is often the case with men when they're trying to talk about issues, that they were kind of cloaked in like, what are your thoughts about NOFAP, which is this thing where guys withhold ejaculation?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8822" target="_blank">02:27:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8822" target="_blank">02:27:02.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Does it increase testosterone?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8823" target="_blank">02:27:03.940</a></span> | <span class="t">It turns out in the short run it does.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8825" target="_blank">02:27:05.300</a></span> | <span class="t">In the long term it's probably not good for the prostate, et cetera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8827" target="_blank">02:27:07.640</a></span> | <span class="t">But then it turned out they were really asking about masturbation, they were really asking about pornography, and then all of a sudden, I don't know what changed out there, but there's been this deluge of questions from young guys of how they can stop engaging in online porn.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8844" target="_blank">02:27:24.980</a></span> | <span class="t">A key to that is what you said about we look at them differently.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8849" target="_blank">02:27:29.720</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, they're going to keep it secret.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8852" target="_blank">02:27:32.280</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, and there's a saying, secrets keep us sick, but I believe there's like a real – almost a biology to that in that, you know, if you're holding it in, not sharing it, you know, there's no really place for it to go but shame.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8864" target="_blank">02:27:44.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And shame separates us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8867" target="_blank">02:27:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And separate, we're not connected.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8871" target="_blank">02:27:51.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And not connected, we're alone, and alone we're – you know, we keep carrying that forward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8874" target="_blank">02:27:54.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Alone we're dead.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8875" target="_blank">02:27:55.620</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, maybe not in that sense anymore like we talked about earlier, but like we're not really living.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8882" target="_blank">02:28:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And so they're, you know, these guys are hearing you on a podcast and then DMing you, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8890" target="_blank">02:28:10.900</a></span> | <span class="t">They're probably not in a personal close relationship with you, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8894" target="_blank">02:28:14.360</a></span> | <span class="t">It's easier to send it there than maybe go ask for help with somebody in their area or go to a meeting or something like that because of the stigma.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8904" target="_blank">02:28:24.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's good that you've opened up the ability for people to do that but to continue to direct them back to, you know, let's try to treat this like we would any other addiction, at least from the standpoint of you've got to talk about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8917" target="_blank">02:28:37.260</a></span> | <span class="t">You've got to have some sort of admission.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8918" target="_blank">02:28:38.980</a></span> | <span class="t">You've got to be able to find a community around it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8921" target="_blank">02:28:41.420</a></span> | <span class="t">You want to be able to do work, you know, most likely with a therapist or a team of therapists that can help you understand what's driving that behavior.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8928" target="_blank">02:28:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, and, you know, you and I have had long discussions about trauma before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8934" target="_blank">02:28:54.540</a></span> | <span class="t">That's something I've worked with for many years or most of my career as I came into being a therapist.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8942" target="_blank">02:29:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, and in trauma therapy, we're often going back to seeing – we do a history and really kind of understand where the patterns started, you know, and it's really helpful, you know, for me as a therapist.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8957" target="_blank">02:29:17.940</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just when I can see where it is because I can start making sense of how people are behaving this way as adults when I can see all of the experiences they had and especially the more negative, impactful ones, which tend to impact the brain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8971" target="_blank">02:29:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Like you always say, the fastest way to plasticity is through a traumatic event.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8975" target="_blank">02:29:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I believe that's how you say it, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8977" target="_blank">02:29:37.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, one trial learning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8978" target="_blank">02:29:38.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It just takes once.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8979" target="_blank">02:29:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8980" target="_blank">02:29:40.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Unfortunately, but luckily there's plasticity in the other direction too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8983" target="_blank">02:29:43.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It just takes a little bit longer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8985" target="_blank">02:29:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that's where addiction comes in too because, you know, you can kind of feel a sense of plasticity, you know, if I'm drinking or if I'm doing drugs, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=8995" target="_blank">02:29:55.020</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know if that's the actual term for it, but I'm not feeling like my brain is so stuck in that direction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9000" target="_blank">02:30:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You know,

class="t">What comes to mind for – to kind of encapsulate all of it because it gets to the underlying mechanisms I think is, you know, beware the things that come easily and quickly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9013" target="_blank">02:30:13.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9014" target="_blank">02:30:14.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Like really beware those things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

of sex, but the illusion of pseudo-sex, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9024" target="_blank">02:30:24.520</a></span> | <span

<span class="t">Beware that thing because there are all these positive reward signals that are masking what soon will happen, which is that that thing is going to make you kind of lopsided internally and make you crave it more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9058" target="_blank">02:30:58.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I

target="_blank">02:31:04.260</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a problem, and I think – I kind of like that in the sense that – because many people are struggling, and we don't often glorify the struggle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9074" target="_blank">02:31:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">We're all trying to struggle

what's interesting, Michael Easter, you know, with the comfort crisis, I mean, doing these hard, Misogi challenges he calls them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9206" target="_blank">02:33:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I mean, think about like self-imposing discomfort so that you don't get pulled into the illusion of comfort.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9214" target="_blank">02:33:34.140</a></span> | <span

class="t">I mean, I think it's coming clear to me now that the things that come easy are the traps.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9219" target="_blank">02:33:39.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9220" target="_blank">02:33:40.440</a></span> | <span class="t">They're the traps.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9221" target="_blank">02:33:41.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So folks, if you're really good at something, doesn't mean don't lean into it, but if something comes really easily for you, you have to be very mindful of that thing and other things around it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9231" target="_blank">02:33:51.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Sounds like you created discomfort for yourself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9233" target="_blank">02:33:53.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe there's like a discomfort appetite that if we don't satisfy through healthy things, we will satisfy through unhealthy things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9242" target="_blank">02:34:02.180</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a very interesting concept.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9244" target="_blank">02:34:04.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, I don't know where that would exist in the nervous system, but because you hear, oh, we're trying to avoid pain and go toward pleasure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9250" target="_blank">02:34:10.460</a></span> | <span class="t">But those models are, that's

class="t">So I like the idea of a ration of discomfort to experience every day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9258" target="_blank">02:34:18.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Isn't it that we're kind of built to expend energy and then sleep and then wake up the next day and expend energy and sleep?</span></div><div

and we just carry the stressors from the day before rather than just breaking it down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9272"

this is like something that was developed as – it would be like if somebody developed a therapeutic modality 80 years ago and then passed it on to everybody that they gave – every client they had and then they ran it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9573" target="_blank">02:39:33.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, it's not run by professional counselors, although there are professional counselors and then there's every walk of life from – I've been around people who are anything from priests to rabbis to doctors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9586" target="_blank">02:39:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's no prejudice in the disease.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9591" target="_blank">02:39:51.080</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, you can build a community where people are willing to help and be in service to each other and, you know, you can't call a therapist any time during the night.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9600" target="_blank">02:40:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You can't just look up and find a meeting and go.</span></div><div class="c"><span

a day anywhere.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9608" target="_blank">02:40:08.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And the meeting is not going to solve it necessarily.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9610" target="_blank">02:40:10.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But the fact that you're moving in that direction, you know, you're spending an hour – if you're spending an hour thinking and reflecting and talking about it, even if you're not like in silent meditation, it's almost like a meditation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9625" target="_blank">02:40:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're spending an hour hearing people talk about how they recovered and helping you, it's an hour that you're not doing the other thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9632" target="_blank">02:40:32.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And in the beginning, that might be the white knuckling of it, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9634" target="_blank">02:40:34.740</a></span> | <span class="t">But the idea is to get out of white knuckling, you know?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9638" target="_blank">02:40:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the beauty of the 12-step programs, which was founded by the guys that started Alcoholics Anonymous and then Dr. Bob Smith and Bill Wilson, and the way they discovered it was by helping each other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9650" target="_blank">02:40:50.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Bill Wilson had been trying to

introduced to something called the Oxford Group, which was more of a religious group based in Christianity, and they had like a – I think it was a four-step process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9661" target="_blank">02:41:01.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Which the 12 steps are just kind of really expanded on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9665" target="_blank">02:41:05.220</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's a – in the literature, there's this beautiful moment where Bill Wilson had been trying to stay sober for a while, and he was, but he was really white knuckling it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9676" target="_blank">02:41:16.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And he'd been – at his home in New York, he'd been going into the hospital and helping others.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9681" target="_blank">02:41:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And he found by trying to help others, he stayed sober.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9684" target="_blank">02:41:24.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And he's a guy that had struggled for a very long time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9688" target="_blank">02:41:28.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And none of those guys were staying sober, but he was, which was kind of – he first kind of conceptualized this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9695" target="_blank">02:41:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then he was on a business trip in Akron, Ohio, which is where this Dr. Bob Smith lived.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9699" target="_blank">02:41:39.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And he was staying at this hotel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9701" target="_blank">02:41:41.300</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it was called the Mayflower Hotel in the history.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9703" target="_blank">02:41:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And he had come out of a business meeting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9706" target="_blank">02:41:46.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it didn't go the way he wanted.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9707" target="_blank">02:41:47.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And he walked in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9708" target="_blank">02:41:48.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And in the story, he's describing hearing the bar and the kind of clinking of the glasses over here and the kind of the call of the bar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9717" target="_blank">02:41:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And he had some change in his pocket, and it was in the 1930s, early 1930s, maybe 34, 35.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9725" target="_blank">02:42:05.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there was a bank of phones over here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9727" target="_blank">02:42:07.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And so he was kind of pulled between the bar and the phones.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9732" target="_blank">02:42:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And for whatever reason, he went to the phones.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9736" target="_blank">02:42:16.020</a></span> | <span class="t">He paused, and he went there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9737" target="_blank">02:42:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And he called – I forget who he called, maybe the hospital, and he asked if there was – I think he basically asked if there was any drunks in the town he could help.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9744" target="_blank">02:42:24.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And they directed him to – in some way to this doctor who was like the local town doctor, Bob Smith.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9750" target="_blank">02:42:30.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And he was also an alcoholic who had struggled for a long time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9756" target="_blank">02:42:36.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And they met, and he – I think he went to his house or he might have been in the hospital at the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9761" target="_blank">02:42:41.380</a></span> | <span class="t">I could have the history a little bit wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9762" target="_blank">02:42:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">But they met and started talking, and I think Bob relapsed one more time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9766" target="_blank">02:42:46.820</a></span> | <span class="t">But they started talking and helping each other, and then they went and helped another guy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9771" target="_blank">02:42:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then they went and helped another guy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9774" target="_blank">02:42:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's a whole history to like how it developed and then how they wrote a book together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9779" target="_blank">02:42:59.580</a></span> | <span class="t">The book was really meant to send – it was written like four years later – send the information about alcoholism and Alcoholics Anonymous to everywhere in the country where they didn't have meetings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9791" target="_blank">02:43:11.740</a></span> | <span class="t">They started having these

target="_blank">02:43:17.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's really interesting because this was one man's decision.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9801" target="_blank">02:43:21.660</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, instead of going to the bar or going to the phone, instead of going to the bar, he made one phone call, and that transformed millions of lives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9810"

Alcoholics Anonymous.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=9829" target="_blank">02:43:49.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know,

I solicited for questions from the internet about addiction, broadly speaking, and got some great questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10026" target="_blank">02:47:06.840</a></span> | <span class="t">The first question is, is addiction the problem – they put the in quotes – or is addiction an attempted solution to a different but less obvious problem?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10038" target="_blank">02:47:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">The short answer to that is both.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10040" target="_blank">02:47:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">The addiction is really the solution to some sort of discomfort or stress that they're experiencing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10046" target="_blank">02:47:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">But then the addiction itself becomes problematic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10049" target="_blank">02:47:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I would say that addiction is the solution in the sense that it's the person's attempt to solve or to find relief from whatever stressor they're experiencing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10059" target="_blank">02:47:39.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's a solution that becomes problematic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10062" target="_blank">02:47:42.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So it takes on a life of its own.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10064" target="_blank">02:47:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">It becomes its own trauma itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10067" target="_blank">02:47:47.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, drinking alcoholically and blacking out is a trauma to your body, to your brain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10073" target="_blank">02:47:53.100</a></span> | <span class="t">The things that people do in addiction become more traumatic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10076" target="_blank">02:47:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I think there's this cycle that I always use in the background called – it's trauma, stress, and addiction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10082" target="_blank">02:48:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Expanding the definition of trauma to wound, it starts with a wound.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10086" target="_blank">02:48:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And then stress is the relationship to that wound, much like a limp after a broken leg.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10092" target="_blank">02:48:12.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And when stress gets big enough, people look for relief, and so they look to behaviors or substances, which then can, if the stress is big enough and repeated, can become alcoholic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10104" target="_blank">02:48:24.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So that stress is not really the wound, it's the relationship to it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10109" target="_blank">02:48:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Like I said, the limp after the broken leg.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10111" target="_blank">02:48:31.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But that limp, while it's not the broken leg, informs how we walk or don't walk, how we run or don't run, how we view ourselves,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10119" target="_blank">02:48:39.340</a></span> | <span class="t">how we view the other people in the world view us, and all of those things together can lead to a level of stress where people find relief.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10126" target="_blank">02:48:46.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And since it's chronic, then they keep using.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10129" target="_blank">02:48:49.520</a></span> | <span class="t">But then the behaviors and things that they do while they're using or drinking create a trauma itself, which then leads to more stress, which then leads to more addiction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10138" target="_blank">02:48:58.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So it becomes kind of this perpetual motion machine, if you will.</span></div><div

stress.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10144" target="_blank">02:49:04.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div

veterans.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10284" target="_blank">02:51:24.360</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, coming home, like a lot of the mundane stuff almost didn't feel like they felt alive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10290" target="_blank">02:51:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, and of course, this isn't everybody.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10292" target="_blank">02:51:32.680</a></span> | <span class="t">This is the ones that were coming to me, but that they needed to be involved in like really risky behaviors or really high-adrenaline behaviors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10301" target="_blank">02:51:41.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And it felt like they were just getting to kind of baseline of being normal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10304" target="_blank">02:51:44.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It wasn't even like taking them to another edge.</span></div><div class="c"><span

training or the training that they do later on for more Special Forces is, while it's skills training, it's really nervous system training, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10320" target="_blank">02:52:00.580</a></span> | <span class="t">It's the ability to do those skills under an extreme amount of stress or lack of

they're kind of oriented in that way, then when they come home or they're in environments where it doesn't – it takes a lot to bring them up just to that level of like what might feel normal for them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10344" target="_blank">02:52:24.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Their kind of system is set up

progressive – I don't know if it was – was it on your podcast or did I read about this somewhere else where when they took – you know, there's the classic study about taking rats with cocaine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10407" target="_blank">02:53:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And they'll – they had water

of addiction beyond what a use disorder is in the DSM and move towards do you have it or does it have you, absolutely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

we're going to go into some sort of major withdrawal but I would imagine there would be some sort of withdrawal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

colleague Nolan Williams at Stanford with these single Ibogaine trials for people getting over alcoholism, meaning one – taking Ibogaine once or twice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10529" target="_blank">02:55:29.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Mostly in veterans was covered on the Rogan podcast and Nolan's been on

class="t">Let's leave MDMA out of it because that's more for the treatment of trauma and it's not actually a classic psychedelic but things like psilocybin, Ibogaine for people seeking relief from alcohol and drugs specifically but maybe other addictions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10553" target="_blank">02:55:53.960</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I've seen some pretty incredible things happen with people and I'm glad that the studies have been going on specifically around psilocybin in the U.S.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10563" target="_blank">02:56:03.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not really

anybody that is doing Ibogaine treatments are either – you know, I don't know if they're finding it in the U.S. or they're going to Mexico or wherever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10573" target="_blank">02:56:13.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It has to be done in Mexico.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10574" target="_blank">02:56:14.920</a></span> | <span class="t">They're doing the brain scans at Stanford before and after.</span></div><div

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10578" target="_blank">02:56:18.620</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not currently – in the new administration –</span></div><div class="c"><span

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10582" target="_blank">02:56:22.600</a></span> | <span class="t">The rates of remission from alcohol use disorder and other substance use disorders is somewhere – there's a range but 40 to in some cases 80% with one or two Ibogaine trials.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10596" target="_blank">02:56:36.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But this is with therapeutic support.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10597" target="_blank">02:56:37.800</a></span> | <span class="t">There are a bunch of other things happening there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10600" target="_blank">02:56:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there's evidence of brain plasticity in a number of brain areas.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10603" target="_blank">02:56:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So I don't know enough about the studies happening before, like, they were doing this where Stanford was doing a study and taking people down to Mexico or people going down there to do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10611" target="_blank">02:56:51.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It was kind of a lot of – I don't know how else to say it, but renegade folks doing it outside wasn't always, you know, run by medical teams and people making sure that everybody is safe, at least from my experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10625" target="_blank">02:57:05.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Although then I've seen some amazing things around it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10628" target="_blank">02:57:08.560</a></span> | <span class="t">My general take on psychedelics, if I look at PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder, I really see that as you could almost substitute state disorder in there for stress because people get stuck in a certain state.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10642" target="_blank">02:57:22.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's call it the survival state.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10644" target="_blank">02:57:24.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, that's, as I've said, one of our biggest challenges is that we go into survival mode and we don't need to go into survival mode, an appropriate response at an inappropriate time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10654" target="_blank">02:57:34.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And so things like psychedelics or – we actually can see this with breathwork and can help people have an experience where they recognize another state, you know, that they can be in another state, not another state of the U.S., but, like, they have access to something other than survival.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10673" target="_blank">02:57:53.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I think like any other approach to medicine that seems miraculous at times, there's a lot out there of this worked for me, so everybody should try it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

overall of psychedelics because I think there's definitely a place for them, but I'm really most concerned about the ethics that we develop around them, who's delivering it, what are the rule outs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10705" target="_blank">02:58:25.060</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I know we weren't – we were going to leave MDMA out, but I know some of the MAP studies, it was like three sessions, I think it was, over – and I don't think that the world that kind of sees those is then taking that, especially in the personal development world, going, we're going to do three sessions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10719"

people with psychological and psychiatric disorders that it can really impact in another way, you know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10737" target="_blank">02:58:57.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Definitely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10758" target="_blank">02:59:18.020</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's a real – we need to really understand the ethics around it and the timeframe and then make sure that people are following that up with something because I think you've used this example before of like kind of being on a trampoline and you can jump up and see the top of the building, you know, and you can see where you want to be, but you haven't built the staircase or the elevator yet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

and an experience of this person that I can be, but I don't think that there's going to be like some immediate structural change that's going to last.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10789" target="_blank">02:59:49.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And the danger in that is then people start using that over and over again and can lean on that as a crutch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10795" target="_blank">02:59:55.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Last

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10807" target="_blank">03:00:07.960</a></span> | <span class="t">This sounds like somebody who is aware of the all too common scenario of this kid, this parent, this coworker, this significant other is clearly an alcoholic, clearly a drug addict, clearly addicted to fill in the blank.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10823" target="_blank">03:00:23.700</a></span> | <span class="t">What can people reasonably do assuming that person is not in a medical crisis yet?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10830" target="_blank">03:00:30.860</a></span> | <span class="t">I think one of the biggest things we can do is talk to them, but also without shaming them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10835" target="_blank">03:00:35.940</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, and if you don't know how to talk to them, reach out for some help yourself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10842" target="_blank">03:00:42.820</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, there's, like I said, there's family support meetings like Al-Anon that you can go to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10848" target="_blank">03:00:48.260</a></span> | <span class="t">If you reach out to a treatment center like ours, you can, we're happy to talk to the families and help point them in the right direction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10856" target="_blank">03:00:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But having an open conversation without shaming them and understanding that this is a, you know, approaching it with the idea that this is a disease and a, and a, like a, like, like we're talking to a sick friend now that we're talking to a bad, a bad person.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10872" target="_blank">03:01:12.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Can I ask slash offer one, which is if, if a 12-step meeting is an open meeting, as they call it, like an open AA meeting, you could offer to go with them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10882" target="_blank">03:01:22.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Yep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10882" target="_blank">03:01:22.620</a></span> | <span class="t">When they do the around the circle thing, if you go and you don't want to say anything, you just say pass, no one, no one's going to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10890" target="_blank">03:01:30.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, in a lot of places they don't even do around the circle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10892" target="_blank">03:01:32.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10892" target="_blank">03:01:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can, you could go with them to, you could take them to a meeting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10895" target="_blank">03:01:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, as long as it's an, what's called an open meeting, you don't have to be an alcoholic or an addict to go to that meeting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10900" target="_blank">03:01:40.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you could take them, you could even go and just observe, believe it or not, some non-alcoholics have come to 12-step meetings that were open meetings to learn more about it, to then be able to go help somebody that they know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10913" target="_blank">03:01:53.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And reach out and find a therapist that can do an assessment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10918" target="_blank">03:01:58.840</a></span> | <span class="t">In our mission to create access, we have been really doing some kind of innovative stuff around virtual care and in-home care.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10926" target="_blank">03:02:06.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So when there are people that are resistant and maybe if they even, it is true that they need to go to a residential treatment center, that we can offer this different service that's much lower cost and covered by insurance that we can come in and kind of build a relationship with them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10939" target="_blank">03:02:19.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, in some way, sometimes it works for them and they're able to move through it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10945" target="_blank">03:02:25.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And other times we're able to help them witness their failures and then having done complete assessments with them, get them to the correct level of care and make sure that the family has everything they need.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10954" target="_blank">03:02:34.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So those options are out there as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10955" target="_blank">03:02:35.980</a></span> | <span class="t">I've seen the work you do help so many people, so, so many people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10961" target="_blank">03:02:41.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I just feel very lucky you come on here and share with a lot more people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10967" target="_blank">03:02:47.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10967" target="_blank">03:02:47.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm sure you'll get some outreach.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10970" target="_blank">03:02:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We'll put links to where people can find you and some of the resources and things that you're up to and the papers and other things mentioned.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10977" target="_blank">03:02:57.580</a></span> | <span class="t">But, yeah, on behalf of myself and everyone listening and watching, I just want to say thank you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10983" target="_blank">03:03:03.220</a></span> | <span class="t">You're doing

today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=10999" target="_blank">03:03:19.460</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, you literally was like I'm going to help people today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=11001" target="_blank">03:03:21.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to write, do these little diagrams and these little things, and I'm going to help them today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=11005" target="_blank">03:03:25.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And helping people today and the next day and the next day, you know, has led to you having such an impact in the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=11014" target="_blank">03:03:34.140</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">03:03:40.980</a></span> | <span class="t">I've had men specifically, mostly men that come to me more open because of what they've heard you talk about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=11028" target="_blank">03:03:48.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And conversely, I've had men that we're working with that are very closed off, and then I'll have them listen to something that you've done, and it opens them up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=11040" target="_blank">03:04:00.020</a></span> | <span class="t">My wife wanted me to tell you, you know, she's a therapist too, and she was running a group this morning with a group of kind of more mentally ill folks, and they were doing a group on stress management.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=11052" target="_blank">03:04:12.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And she used a video of the physiological sigh, so she wanted to say thank you for that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=11056" target="_blank">03:04:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But I know lots of therapists that are using that, and it's just, you make our jobs easier by bringing awareness to the challenges and problems that are out there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=11066" target="_blank">03:04:26.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So I really, really appreciate that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=11067" target="_blank">03:04:27.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Plus, I just appreciate you as a human being and very much value our friendship.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

not for you and your support and the many things you've taught me and our friendship, I definitely wouldn't be doing this, and maybe wouldn't even be here today at all, in the biggest sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yn4tJEmJU&t=11094" target="_blank">03:04:54.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So thanks for
