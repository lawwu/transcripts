There is a big decision as to whether we rent our current home to hang on of this cheap debt. What do you think? - Yeah, so this is something that we faced. And for me, I just don't want to be a landlord.</p><p>How much incremental money is that going to be? And do I want to be a landlord? And the math for being a landlord works really well if you have full occupancy. But the margins on it, at least when I was doing the math, seemed to be like, oh, you know, 10, 20%.</p><p>But if someone's not there for a month, like someone moves out and then you got to fill it, it just felt like all that headache, getting the call that the dryer break, something's flooding, I don't know. I just didn't want to deal with it. So as much as I felt like I had this great asset, I just said, I don't want to be a landlord.</p><p>I will find other great assets to buy or invest in or do something with my time. And I sold it.</p></div></div></body></html>
