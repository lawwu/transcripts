target="_blank">00:01:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">seems so absolute that every time a grown-up child of a Christian family departs from the way of wisdom</span></div><div class="c"><span

| <span class="t">And that's a pretty heavy burden to bear for most parents,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPmlB1nfqfs&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but if that's what the text means, then we should be willing to bear it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPmlB1nfqfs&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There are passages in the Bibleâ€”I mean, before I say what I think that promise actually means,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPmlB1nfqfs&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">there are passages in the Bible where the disobedience of children as adults,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPmlB1nfqfs&t=139" target="_blank">00:02:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">departing from the faith and making a shipwreck of their lives,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPmlB1nfqfs&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">there are passages in the Bible that are traced back to the failures of fathers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPmlB1nfqfs&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">For example, Adonijah, David's son.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPmlB1nfqfs&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">David, man after God's own heart, 1 Kings 1, 5, Adonijah exalted himself, saying, "I will be king."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPmlB1nfqfs&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And he prepared for himself chariots and horsemen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPmlB1nfqfs&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">His

target="_blank">00:02:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now that is a very intentional criticism of David.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPmlB1nfqfs&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">His father had never taken the time to say, "Don't do that,"</span></div><div

Adonijah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPmlB1nfqfs&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And clearly this biblical writer is chalking up the rebelliousness of Adonijah</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPmlB1nfqfs&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">against his own dad for the failure of his father to rebuke him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPmlB1nfqfs&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So there it is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPmlB1nfqfs&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, we do err, and our errors have terrible consequences.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPmlB1nfqfs&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's another example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

target="_blank">00:03:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Wow. I mean, Eli, when he died, because his sons had been killed by God for their disobedience,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPmlB1nfqfs&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">fell over backwards and broke his neck because he was fat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPmlB1nfqfs&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it says he got fat because he honored his sons above God</span></div><div

the sacrifices to eat,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPmlB1nfqfs&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and their dad loved the food so much he wouldn't criticize his kids.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPmlB1nfqfs&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, he criticized their fornication in the temple,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPmlB1nfqfs&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but they kept their jobs, and they kept misusing the sacrifices.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPmlB1nfqfs&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And what this shows is that a dad can be very selective in his discipline and his criticism of his children,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPmlB1nfqfs&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and clearly the prophet here wants to criticize Eli for honoring his sons above God</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPmlB1nfqfs&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">by failing to reprimand them in the way they were handling the sacrifice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPmlB1nfqfs&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the point there is simply not to blow off Proverbs 22:6</span></div><div
