<span class="t">Remember what God said to His people in Deuteronomy 8, verse 2,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWm8IBBz4tU&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"And you shall remember the whole way that the Lord God has led you these 40 years in the wilderness,</span></div><div class="c"><span

of what this season means is that it might mean a season of testing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWm8IBBz4tU&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">where God lets this precious couple who seems to be doing such an amazing work,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWm8IBBz4tU&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">hunger for a season in order to see what is in their heart.</span></div><div

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWm8IBBz4tU&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is not an ending, not a testing so much as a call for adjustment in strategy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWm8IBBz4tU&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm thinking mainly in terms of strategy of fundraising.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWm8IBBz4tU&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Many great missionaries have taken the approach of simply expressing what the ministry is rather than asking for money.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWm8IBBz4tU&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But I want to stress for our friends that there's no biblical mandate for that strategy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWm8IBBz4tU&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's clear biblical example of forthright, honest, humble, asking for financial support.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWm8IBBz4tU&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Read especially 2 Corinthians 8 and 9.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWm8IBBz4tU&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Those are perfect chapters for fundraising among Christians.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWm8IBBz4tU&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Paul is clear in his straightforward, honest request that the churches give money to support the poor in Jerusalem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWm8IBBz4tU&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's not unbiblical or fleshly or humanistic or unbelieving to ask God's people to support God's work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWm8IBBz4tU&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that may be, I don't know, that may be a change in strategy that God would want our friends to consider.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWm8IBBz4tU&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't say it's required. I just say it's permitted, though it's not exactly a one to one correspondence, clearly not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWm8IBBz4tU&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's an example of a change in strategy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWm8IBBz4tU&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Paul tries to go into Phrygia and Galatia.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWm8IBBz4tU&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And here's what it says. They went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWm8IBBz4tU&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And when they had come up to Mycenae, they attempted to go into Bithynia, but the spirit of Jesus did not allow them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWm8IBBz4tU&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So passing by Mycenae, they went down to Troas.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWm8IBBz4tU&t=322" target="_blank">00:05:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's Acts 16, 6 through 8. And the point is simply Paul himself planned two or three specific avenues of ministry that he expected God to bless.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWm8IBBz4tU&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And God said no. He turned him back from that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWm8IBBz4tU&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there had to be a change in strategy for Paul when he discerned God wasn't going to prosper that particular avenue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWm8IBBz4tU&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's the last possibility of what this season might mean.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWm8IBBz4tU&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It might mean the ending of this form of ministry for them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWm8IBBz4tU&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">While it's not an exact parallel, Jesus sent out his disciples and he said, and wherever they do not receive you, when you leave that town, shake off the dust from your feet as a testimony against them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWm8IBBz4tU&t=375" target="_blank">00:06:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Luke 9, 5. In other words, there is a time when you leave a work and move on to another town.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWm8IBBz4tU&t=385" target="_blank">00:06:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, of course, don't at all mean to say these situations are the same because our friends clearly are involved not in being rejected by a town, but having a fruitful ministry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWm8IBBz4tU&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so in that sense, they're not similar at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWm8IBBz4tU&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But I'm simply drawing attention to the fact that those folks went into that town with the full intention of doing fruitful ministry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWm8IBBz4tU&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And lo and behold, they have to ski-daddle because things aren't going well for them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWm8IBBz4tU&t=416" target="_blank">00:06:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And God says, no, don't don't stay. It's OK.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWm8IBBz4tU&t=420" target="_blank">00:07:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You can change your strategy here. You can move on and let that ministry in that town for a season stop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWm8IBBz4tU&t=427" target="_blank">00:07:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's the point I'm making. It may be that there are stoppings that have to be considered.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWm8IBBz4tU&t=433" target="_blank">00:07:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I would simply say that that interpretation of ending, you should be very, very slow to take up and conclude that's what God is doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWm8IBBz4tU&t=445" target="_blank">00:07:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think we should always think of a change in ministry rather than an end of a ministry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWm8IBBz4tU&t=452" target="_blank">00:07:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In other words, if God is, in fact, saying that was a great season, that ministry is over.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWm8IBBz4tU&t=459" target="_blank">00:07:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He's not calling them to go home and vegetate on their couch watching nice videos.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWm8IBBz4tU&t=464" target="_blank">00:07:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He's calling them to do something else really significant with their lives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWm8IBBz4tU&t=469" target="_blank">00:07:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that call should, I think, confirm the ending of the ministry, if that's the case, which I hope will be a last resort and that God would show them a way to stay the course in what they're doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWm8IBBz4tU&t=481" target="_blank">00:08:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's just close with this practical suggestion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWm8IBBz4tU&t=484" target="_blank">00:08:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Meditate on Psalm 25. It is a precious psalm of guidance and may speak directly to your hearts, especially verses eight and nine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWm8IBBz4tU&t=496" target="_blank">00:08:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Good and upright is the Lord.
