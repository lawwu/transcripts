But today, we're not going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=75" target="_blank">00:01:15.040</a></span> | <span class="t">be looking at that, we're going to be looking at one of the earliest methods for image retrieval,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=80" target="_blank">00:01:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">which is color histograms. Color histograms represent one of the earliest content-based</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=88" target="_blank">00:01:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">image retrieval techniques, and they allow us to search through images and retrieve similar</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=93" target="_blank">00:01:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">images based on their color profiles. And we can see an example of what we're going to learn about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=99" target="_blank">00:01:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">here. So we have this query image, it's just a city, you can see it's very blue and orange,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and to the right here, we have this, it was basically, this is what the color histogram is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=111" target="_blank">00:01:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, when we actually build our color histograms and search with them, we are going to convert</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=117" target="_blank">00:01:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">them into a single vector, so an image embedding. And with that image embedding, we're going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=124" target="_blank">00:02:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">return these five images. Now, this is using a very small dataset. We have, I think it is literally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">21 images, it's tiny. So with that in mind, this is returning pretty relevant images when we speak</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">about the color content of these images. They all seem to have this similar sort of aesthetic,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of blues and oranges. So this is pretty much what we're going to do. And underneath these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">images, you can actually see the color profiles as well. So the one to the right is actually just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">a duplicate image, it's the same image. But then the other ones, we can see that they all have this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of, or some of them have this peak in the red, and then they're pretty flat with the rest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">of the colors. So this example demonstrates the core idea of color histograms. That is, we take</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">an image, translate it into the histograms that you saw, which we then translate into a image</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">embedding vector, and then use our color profile embedding to retrieve other similar images based</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">on their color profiles. Now, there are many pros and cons to this technique. I mean, as you'd expect,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">it's one of the earliest techniques for image retrieval, but there are a lot of benefits. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">we'll discuss a lot of those as we go through this video and just understand how to actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">implement a color histogram. It'll become quite clear what the pros and cons are, if you haven't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">figured a few of those out already. Now, we're going to work through two notebooks. The first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">one's just going to show us how we actually build color histograms, so we can actually see step by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">step the actual process. And the second one is where we'll implement the search component. Now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">you can find links to both of these notebooks in the description of this video. So if you want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">follow along, go ahead, open those, and you'll be able to go through the code live. So a few things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">that we need to install. So just pip install, we have OpenCV library, NumPy, and datasets. Now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">OpenCV is just a public computer vision library. NumPy, I'm sure you probably know what it is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just focused on numerical operations for arrays. And datasets is HuggingFace datasets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">HuggingFace is like an NLP library, and datasets is their way of allowing people to store datasets</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and download them super easily. So for us, we are going to use that to get this image set here. Now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">you can use your own images if you like. You don't have to do this one, but this is what I'm going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">to go with. And this is, like I said, it's, I think, 21 images. It's really not that many,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">but it's all we need for this example. So you can load the dataset. So from datasets, load dataset,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and we have this pinecone image set. If you'd like to see where this dataset is, you can go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to HuggingFace.co/datasets, and then you just type in the dataset name that you see here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">pinecone/image set. And it will take you to where, yeah, this website here, which is where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=316" target="_blank">00:05:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">this dataset is actually hosted. Now inside, actually, let me run this. So inside here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">we have this image bytes feature, and this is just a base 64 encoded representation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=333" target="_blank">00:05:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">of our image bytes. So when we download these, we need to decode them, again, using base 64.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So we do that here. So we're just going to create this processing function,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=347" target="_blank">00:05:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and we're going to decode everything. I don't think there's really much to go through there,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">but from that, we'll get these images. Okay. And we can actually check. So let's just see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">how many images there are. 21. Okay. And this should align to appear as always number of rows</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">21. Okay. Cool. And we can display the images now with matplotlib. And you see we get this image</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.560</a></span> | <span class="t">with these three dogs, but they're pretty blue. That's because we have loaded them,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">or we've decoded them using the OpenCV library. And OpenCV library, it reads images using the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">color channels, blue, green, and red in that order. And I don't know why they do that. It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of the opposite way of what most things do, which is red, green, and blue, or RGB.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=408" target="_blank">00:06:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So what we need to do is actually flip those color channels if we'd like to see the true color</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=413" target="_blank">00:06:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">version of this image. So let me show you. So at the moment, this is a shape of that image. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.760</a></span> | <span class="t">this image is actually an array. These two here are like the actual pixel values. So you can see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=431" target="_blank">00:07:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">two, five, six, zero at the bottom here. And then you can see one, six, zero, zero over here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=439" target="_blank">00:07:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So it's the Y, Y axis or the height of the image, and this is the width of the image.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=445" target="_blank">00:07:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And then this three, these are the color channels. So it's the blue, green, and red color channels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=452" target="_blank">00:07:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And here are the color values. So blue, green, and red for the very top left pixel,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=465" target="_blank">00:07:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">right up there in the corner. Okay. So we can see these values, by the way, so they go from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=473" target="_blank">00:07:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">zero, which is no color up to 255, which is full color. And we'll have a look at that in a moment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=480" target="_blank">00:08:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll show you what I mean. So first let's just flip those color channels. So you do NP flip.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=486" target="_blank">00:08:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">We are going to flip the whole array, but we are going to flip it from axis two, which is a color</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=494" target="_blank">00:08:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">channel axis. So let's do that. And you can see the shape is exactly the same because all we've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=501" target="_blank">00:08:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">done is flipped it, but these, the pixel values here, so it was blue, green, red is now red,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">green, blue. So now we can visualize that and we actually get the actual picture, which is these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=516" target="_blank">00:08:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">three dobs that are very much not blue. So first we're going to go through building a histogram</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=522" target="_blank">00:08:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">the slow way, just so we can understand exactly what is actually going on. So let's take a look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=527" target="_blank">00:08:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">at image zero again. So the three dobs, and we're going to have a look at pixel zero. Okay. So we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=534" target="_blank">00:08:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">have those, those values. Again, this is the other way around. So it's blue, green, red.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=539" target="_blank">00:08:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Now each pixel, like I said, has those blue, green, red activation values from zero, no color</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=548" target="_blank">00:09:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to two, five, five max color. So if you had, let's say these were zero, zero, and zero,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=556" target="_blank">00:09:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">there's no color or there. That means we would get just black. Okay. Cause there's no color.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=563" target="_blank">00:09:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">If we had two, five, five, two, five, five, two, five, five, then we have white, which is just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=569" target="_blank">00:09:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">all the color you can possibly have in one. Okay. And in between them, you have everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=577" target="_blank">00:09:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So here's a few examples. We have blue, green, red, and a few other things. And I'm just going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=583" target="_blank">00:09:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">to plot those in this array here. And I'll show you. Okay. So we can see we have blue, green,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=593" target="_blank">00:09:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">red, and so on and so on. Okay. And you can see all I'm doing is swapping the two, five, fives</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=599" target="_blank">00:09:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">for the orange one. We've got like half of the green color in there as well, but that's pretty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=607" target="_blank">00:10:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">much all we're doing. So every single color can be represented by these values. So back to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=615" target="_blank">00:10:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">previous values, we have that, the top left corner pixel of that picture of three doves,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=623" target="_blank">00:10:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">we have blue, green, and red. So you can think, okay, blue, green, and red, that means it's going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=629" target="_blank">00:10:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">to be sort of a greeny blue color, which is going to be quite neutral because you have all of those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=635" target="_blank">00:10:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">colors kind of in the middle between zero and two, five, five. So we can see that here. So this top</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=644" target="_blank">00:10:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">left block here is actually that pixel, right? Because here, I'm just displaying the three by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=654" target="_blank">00:10:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">three pixels in the top left corner of the image. Okay. And this is a true color image, by the way,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=660" target="_blank">00:11:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">that's why it's RGB image. So that's the one we flipped. Now what we are going to want to do when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=669" target="_blank">00:11:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">we're comparing these images is actually, we don't want an array, we want a vector. So I'm going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=677" target="_blank">00:11:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">reshape this. Okay. And now we have these 409, or four and a little bit million values, which is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=691" target="_blank">00:11:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">just all of the rows in our image, or sorry, yeah, all the rows concatenated together. Okay. That's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=701" target="_blank">00:11:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">what this reshape is doing. Now, if we plot that again, we can still see that those top three</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=708" target="_blank">00:11:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">values are the same. Okay. But there's no more rows underneath those pixels anymore. It's just a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=715" target="_blank">00:11:55.520</a></span> | <span class="t">single row. Okay. Now, okay, we have this one row, but it's still actually an array because we have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=722" target="_blank">00:12:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the three color channels. So we need to also extract those out. Okay. And now we literally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=730" target="_blank">00:12:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">just have three vectors that represent our image. And we can visualize each of these with a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=736" target="_blank">00:12:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">histogram. So let's do that. And this is the color profile, the red, green, and blue color profile of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=746" target="_blank">00:12:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">that image of the three dobs. So what we have on the X axis here is the color activation value from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=754" target="_blank">00:12:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">zero up to 255. And then what we have on the Y axis here is the count of the number of pixels</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=762" target="_blank">00:12:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that have that particular value. So, I mean, we can see this is a pretty neutral color. Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=768" target="_blank">00:12:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Most of the values, and this is probably the case for most images as well. Most of the values are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=773" target="_blank">00:12:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of in the middle point. So it's pretty neutral. You can see that there's a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=780" target="_blank">00:13:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">pixels here that don't have any blue in whatsoever. But beyond that, I don't think there's as much to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=787" target="_blank">00:13:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">note from there. Okay. So let's put everything we've done so far into a single function so that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=794" target="_blank">00:13:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">we can replicate these charts for a few images. So what did we do before? We had our image.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=801" target="_blank">00:13:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">We can also change the number of bins that we use. So you see up here where we've got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=806" target="_blank">00:13:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">an individual bin for every single color activation value. We can push those together</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=812" target="_blank">00:13:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">so that we have less bins and we are going to do that later on because it doesn't really affect</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=817" target="_blank">00:13:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the retrieval performance that much unless you go really low. So first we're going to convert</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=824" target="_blank">00:13:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to a true color image. So from BGR to RGB, I'm just going to show the image so we can see what's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=830" target="_blank">00:13:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">actually happening whenever we call this function. Convert it into a vector with the three channels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=836" target="_blank">00:13:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And then what we're going to do is, so here I'm breaking the values or dividing the values by the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=847" target="_blank">00:14:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">number of bins and then converting them back to integer values. This is basically just a really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=853" target="_blank">00:14:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">quick way of creating the bins. So if I divided this by two, for example, so I had two bins here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=863" target="_blank">00:14:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">we'd get 128 in this division parameter. And we'd divide everything by 128. So we're kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=872" target="_blank">00:14:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">pushing everything together, all these pixel values into discrete categories or bins.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=883" target="_blank">00:14:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we want to get the red, green, blue channels. And then we plot it. So I'm going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=888" target="_blank">00:14:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">run that and we're just going to try it on a few images. So we'll start with this one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=892" target="_blank">00:14:52.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have this image of a city and this is, I think, where you can see color histograms are a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=900" target="_blank">00:15:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">bit more interesting than the last one. So it's a very blue image. And we can see that here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=906" target="_blank">00:15:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">like it is super blue. And then we look at the histograms and the blue histogram, there's a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=911" target="_blank">00:15:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">of high values for blue pixels over here. Now, what you can also do, which I mentioned before,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=919" target="_blank">00:15:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">is use the bins parameter. So we just want, let's say we want 64 bins here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=924" target="_blank">00:15:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can see that we have these sort of bars now where you can really see those before. That's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=932" target="_blank">00:15:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">because we have 64 values and we can reduce that even more. Let's say we wanted to go really low</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=937" target="_blank">00:15:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and we want to go to two. Okay. And we just get these two bins now. Okay. And you can still see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=945" target="_blank">00:15:45.920</a></span> | <span class="t">even from these two bins, it's a very blue image, but of course that's a little bit too much. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=951" target="_blank">00:15:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">we'll stick with sort of values between 32, 64, because you can actually see what's going on with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=958" target="_blank">00:15:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">that. Now, if you have a look at this image, we can see there's very little blue in this image.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=965" target="_blank">00:16:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a lot of green, a little bit of red as well. If you take a look, we can see that almost all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=975" target="_blank">00:16:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">of the blue values are pushed right to the left, which means there's very few high value blue</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=981" target="_blank">00:16:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">pixels in this image. We can do this again here. We see, okay, again, it's very green. So don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=990" target="_blank">00:16:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">really get those blues and we can keep going through all of that. See a few more. And this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=997" target="_blank">00:16:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">one, this one's also interesting because it's a very color specific image. It's a lot of orange</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1003" target="_blank">00:16:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">there. And you can kind of see that because it just got these really big spikes in particular</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1009" target="_blank">00:16:49.680</a></span> | <span class="t">areas of your histograms. So, well, we can see that represented by the histograms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1016" target="_blank">00:16:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Now that's a slow way of building histograms. Like I said before, we've gone through that to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1024" target="_blank">00:17:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">understand exactly what is going on, but it's not the most efficient way of doing it because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1029" target="_blank">00:17:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">there are already functions for creating histograms built into the OpenCV library.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1035" target="_blank">00:17:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's have a look at how we would use that. So we have this CV2, we've imported the CV library</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1044" target="_blank">00:17:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">earlier, just here. So just import CV2. And then what we're going to do is we create, we use this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1052" target="_blank">00:17:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">calc_hist function. We pass in an image, we pass in the color channel. We can only do this one color</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1060" target="_blank">00:17:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">channel at a time. Whether you want to mask anything, I'll explain that in a minute and so on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1065" target="_blank">00:17:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll explain the rest in a moment as well. So we'll run that and you see that we get this 64 by 1</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1072" target="_blank">00:17:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">shape. And this is actually our histogram. So we don't even need to use, before we're using</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1078" target="_blank">00:17:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">matplotlib, the histogram function there. Now we don't even need to use that. We can just plot this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1083" target="_blank">00:18:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">directly. Now there are a few things in here. So we have this calc_hist function. What are all these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1090" target="_blank">00:18:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">values? So we have images, channels, mask_hist_size and ranges. What does that mean exactly?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1098" target="_blank">00:18:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So the images. So this is a list of CV2 loaded images with the channels blue, green and red.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1107" target="_blank">00:18:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you look up here, that's why I've taken the red histogram from the third channel or position</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1114" target="_blank">00:18:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">two and green obviously in one and blue in zero. It can load multiple images. So that's why we have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1122" target="_blank">00:18:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">put that single image inside the square brackets, where is it? Here. And then we have channels. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1132" target="_blank">00:18:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">this is what channels you want to create your histogram for. I'm wanting to extract one at a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1138" target="_blank">00:18:58.720</a></span> | <span class="t">time here. So I've said, okay, I want the red channel or the channel in position two and so on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1146" target="_blank">00:19:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Mask is another image or array which just consists of zeros and ones. Now that allows us to mask a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1155" target="_blank">00:19:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">part of the image if we would like to. So imagine you had half of the images zeros, half the image</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1163" target="_blank">00:19:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">is ones. It means that you would literally remove half of the image when you add that mask to this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1170" target="_blank">00:19:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. Imagine you multiply all the values in your image by the zero ones, the ones that become zero</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1177" target="_blank">00:19:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">there, you can't see them anymore because their color activations are zero. Okay. So they just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1181" target="_blank">00:19:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">become black. That's how it works. And then bins is the number of bins that we'd like to add in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1189" target="_blank">00:19:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">there like we did before. And then the histogram range is the range of color values that we would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1195" target="_blank">00:19:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">expect because we're using RGB, we expect zero to 255. So rewrite zero to 256 because the top value</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1206" target="_blank">00:20:06.240</a></span> | <span class="t">is not inclusive. So that is not included. So actually just goes up to 255. Okay. And let's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1212" target="_blank">00:20:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">have a look at what we get from that. So like I said, we don't need to use the histogram plot from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1217" target="_blank">00:20:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">that plot lib anymore. We can just plot it directly and yeah, we get this. Okay. So I think this is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1225" target="_blank">00:20:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">is it the last image? Yeah. So it's this image here. You can see that we get the same thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1232" target="_blank">00:20:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's the end of the building histograms notebook. Let's have a look at how we actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1238" target="_blank">00:20:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">create our embeddings with this and then how we actually search using these color histograms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1245" target="_blank">00:20:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So we're now in this search histogram notebook and what we're going to do is create</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1250" target="_blank">00:20:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">a function to basically do everything we've done so far. So using the CV2CalcHistForth function,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1257" target="_blank">00:20:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">we're going to use that. And then we're going to actually concatenate the red, green, and blue</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1263" target="_blank">00:21:03.520</a></span> | <span class="t">channels into a single vector. So you've seen this before. We have red, green, and blue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1269" target="_blank">00:21:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Then we concatenate red, green, and blue together along axis zero. And then we reshape. So this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1276" target="_blank">00:21:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">a minus one. That's just to remove, when you run this, there's always like an extra dimension in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1282" target="_blank">00:21:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">there. So we're just removing that extra dimension. Now, if we run that, we should see that we get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1288" target="_blank">00:21:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">this. So we have a 96 dimension vector. Now, why is it 96? So we have, we just set the default</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1297" target="_blank">00:21:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">number of bins to 32 at the top here. So that means we'll get 32 values for the red channel,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1302" target="_blank">00:21:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">for the green value and the blue channel, and then we concatenate them all together. So in the end,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1307" target="_blank">00:21:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">we have all those 32s together, three of them. So we get a vector of dimension 96.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1313" target="_blank">00:21:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you also imagine this, so let me visualize it even. So we run this. You can see here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1322" target="_blank">00:22:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">we have the vector, the values from up to 32 here from 32 to 64, and from 64 to 96. And these are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1332" target="_blank">00:22:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">red, green, and blue. And we get this. It's the same thing as what we saw before, but we just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1338" target="_blank">00:22:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">separated them all into a vector rather than a array with three color channels. Now let's go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1346" target="_blank">00:22:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">through and we'll just use this loop to do that for all of our images. So we're going to create</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1350" target="_blank">00:22:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">all of these image vectors and we can compare vectors with Euclidean distance, although I found</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1358" target="_blank">00:22:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">this didn't work very well, at least not compared to cosine similarity, which we calculated like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1365" target="_blank">00:22:45.920</a></span> | <span class="t">this. So what we're going to do is use cosine similarity to find the most similar matches for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1374" target="_blank">00:22:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">each image, and we're going to pull this within a function to keep everything clean. During</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1381" target="_blank">00:23:01.040</a></span> | <span class="t">visualization, we're also going to use the deflect arrays, so the true color arrays.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1386" target="_blank">00:23:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So I can actually see what they are a little bit better. So I'm going to run that. If I go through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1394" target="_blank">00:23:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">here, all we're doing, we're getting the query vector, which is marked by this index value here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1401" target="_blank">00:23:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So for example, those three dogs, they were position zero within our images. So if I wanted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1406" target="_blank">00:23:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">to use that as our query vector, I would just pass zero to this function here, and that will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1413" target="_blank">00:23:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">retrieve the query vector from the image vectors we've already created. Now I'm going to go through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1418" target="_blank">00:23:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and I'm going to calculate the distance between that query vector and that query image and every</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1424" target="_blank">00:23:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">other vector within our image vectors. That also includes the same image. I mean, it's not hard to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1431" target="_blank">00:23:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">remove that from here, but just for the sake of simplicity, I've kept it in. Plus it tells us if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1437" target="_blank">00:23:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">this is actually working, because we should always return that one as the most similar image.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1442" target="_blank">00:24:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we're using this NumPy arg partition function, which is just based on the distances</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1452" target="_blank">00:24:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">we calculate, it's going to retrieve those indexes. And then we can use those indexes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1459" target="_blank">00:24:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">to retrieve the images, the actual images themselves that are the most similar. So if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1466" target="_blank">00:24:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">we just run that using the dog image, we see that we returned dog image first, because that's the,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1472" target="_blank">00:24:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">oh, sorry, this is reversed. So this is actually the first most similar image. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1479" target="_blank">00:24:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">that is the dog image itself. And then we have these other ones. We didn't know what those are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1486" target="_blank">00:24:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's go ahead. I'm going to write another function. This is not so important, but this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1491" target="_blank">00:24:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">just going to help us visualize these results. So I'm just, there's a lot of NumPy here. We don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1497" target="_blank">00:24:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">really need to go through this, but you can go through this code if you want to. So run that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1504" target="_blank">00:25:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and then I am going to get some results, same as what we saw before. And I just want to visualize</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1510" target="_blank">00:25:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">those. So here I'm actually doing it for another image, so we can ignore that bit there. So for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1517" target="_blank">00:25:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">image six. Okay, cool. So we have, this is the image that we're using as our query. And you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1526" target="_blank">00:25:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">see, this is what I showed you at the start. So it's the city image. And we have these, this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1532" target="_blank">00:25:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">the color histogram for it. And then these are the images that it's returning. So very similar in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1539" target="_blank">00:25:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">terms of the color scheme for each of these. Let's try another one. Okay. So this one, I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1548" target="_blank">00:25:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">it's pretty obvious what this should return, probably another image. As we can see, like that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1553" target="_blank">00:25:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">one. So we have this yellow background with the dog, and then we have the yellow background with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1557" target="_blank">00:25:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">a cat. Okay. And then there's some other images. These ones are not really that similar, but there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1563" target="_blank">00:26:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">aren't that many images in this dataset. So that's why there aren't any others that are more similar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1570" target="_blank">00:26:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And this one, I think is really good because we can really see that these two color histograms</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1580" target="_blank">00:26:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">are very aligned, like they're very similar. And if we want to just have a look at, so at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1586" target="_blank">00:26:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the moment we're using all of the, we're using a default number of bins. I'm not sure what the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1592" target="_blank">00:26:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">value is. Anyway, we can modify the number of bins. So we'll go 96. Let's see what we get.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1600" target="_blank">00:26:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. And we get this. So now we're modifying the bins. We're still returning the same images. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1609" target="_blank">00:26:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">there isn't, I think one of these might be slightly different.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1612" target="_blank">00:26:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So this one here, actually reducing the number of bins here did damage the quality of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1626" target="_blank">00:27:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">this retrieval. So in this case, we still have that relevant image, but it's, we have these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1632" target="_blank">00:27:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">other images that are actually being placed before it, which is surprising, but it's just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1639" target="_blank">00:27:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">one of the limitations of this technique is it's not particularly robust. Now this is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1647" target="_blank">00:27:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">this is how we would actually search using these color histograms. Now I think it's probably quite</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1654" target="_blank">00:27:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">clear what some limitations of this are. This retrieval technique isn't perfect. And I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1661" target="_blank">00:27:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">these results highlight some of those drawbacks. So the key limitation here is like, okay, we come</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1668" target="_blank">00:27:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">up here and we can see, yeah, we were getting, we're returning this image of a cat with a yellow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1674" target="_blank">00:27:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">background. But what if for your use case, you're, you're not actually looking for the similar color.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1681" target="_blank">00:28:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">You're actually looking more for similar content. So you'd actually want to return, okay, this is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1687" target="_blank">00:28:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">dog. I want to return another dog. So probably this image over here, in that case, this is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1693" target="_blank">00:28:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">really bad technique because it's basing everything purely on the color. It's not even looking, it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1698" target="_blank">00:28:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">not looking at textures and not looking at the edges of an image. It's not looking at what is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1704" target="_blank">00:28:24.480</a></span> | <span class="t">inside the image. It's just looking at the color profile of each image. So it's very limited with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1710" target="_blank">00:28:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">that. Now there was further work on color histograms to improve some of these. So for example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1717" target="_blank">00:28:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">different techniques that consider the texture of images, they consider the edges within the images</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1724" target="_blank">00:28:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and a few other things. But still all of these things, they're not going to get you as far as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1731" target="_blank">00:28:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">some of the more recent deep learning methods that allow you to actually consider what is inside the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1737" target="_blank">00:28:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">image from a very sort of human perspective. But that being said, if you just want to return images</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1747" target="_blank">00:29:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">or retrieve images that have a similar sort of aesthetic to a particular image that you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1751" target="_blank">00:29:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">searching with, say even a similar color profile, like we saw with the earlier results up here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1758" target="_blank">00:29:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">we are returning pictures that kind of look like the first image, like the query image. So that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1766" target="_blank">00:29:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">one pro to using this technique. Another one is that it's incredibly easy to implement. We've just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1775" target="_blank">00:29:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">done it. And in reality, we don't even need to go through that sort of slow building a histogram</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1780" target="_blank">00:29:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">part. We can just do it super quickly using OpenCV. And another key benefit is the results</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1789" target="_blank">00:29:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">are very interpretable. So with a lot of deep learning methods, you have a black box, you put</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1797" target="_blank">00:29:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">in some data, you return some results. Why did you get those results? A lot of the time you don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1802" target="_blank">00:30:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">really know. With this, you know exactly why you're returning a particular result. You can see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1808" target="_blank">00:30:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that the color profile is very similar to the one, the particular color profile that you're querying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1813" target="_blank">00:30:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">with. So we understand why that's actually happening here. It's not a black box like neural</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1818" target="_blank">00:30:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">networks. So with all that in mind, this approach to image embedding and retrieving images is great</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1828" target="_blank">00:30:28.560</a></span> | <span class="t">if your use case is looking at the aesthetics or the color profile of images. If you want something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1836" target="_blank">00:30:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">more advanced, of course, you're going to want to go for something else. Now that's it for this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1841" target="_blank">00:30:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">video. I hope this sort of introduction to 1D earlier, image embedding techniques and methods</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1851" target="_blank">00:30:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">for content-based image retrieval has been interesting. But for now, we're going to leave</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3na13AESjw&t=1856" target="_blank">00:30:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">it there. So thank you very much for watching and I will see you again in the next one. Bye.</span></div></div></body></html>
