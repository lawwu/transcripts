So I've broken it down into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=77" target="_blank">00:01:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of four parts so there's the machine learning 101, applied ML, the origin of what I would say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">modern NLP and also just modern NLP and then after that I've also added in another bit so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">this is obviously very specific and we'll just mention this at the end but we won't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=101" target="_blank">00:01:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">really go into too much depth on it. So each of these parts here act as almost like a stage in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=109" target="_blank">00:01:49.680</a></span> | <span class="t">your journey of learning and of course at the start you actually need to learn about machine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=118" target="_blank">00:01:58.240</a></span> | <span class="t">learning and this is almost not even the start. So yes you would start here but you also need to learn</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=129" target="_blank">00:02:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Python for example. So in reality it might actually look something like this. So you would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">start with ML 101 and at the same time in parallel you might want to be learning Python. Now the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">reason I say in parallel rather than just starting with Python is more to do with whether you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">interested in that or not because for me I started Python with the specific interest of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">like algorithmic trading and then very quickly that moved into sort of more machine learning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">But learning Python for the sake of Python I wasn't necessarily that interested in although</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I will say that once I got started I very quickly became very obsessed with just coding random</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">things. So in my personal opinion and that's not necessarily going to be right for everyone,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I would kind of learn those two things in parallel because you have to learn the Python side for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">machine learning side but they both complement each other and having both of them in parallel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">rather than just doing Python will probably keep you more interested than just focusing on one at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">a time. So in terms of resources for just Python I use Codecademy more than anything else. Now when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I used it it was I think cheaper than it is now. So something to be aware of but there are so many</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">good resources out there for learning Python. You probably aren't going to struggle to find anything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">The other thing I would say is also try projects. So just building projects will help your coding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">skills and every other component on here so much because it shows you where you're missing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">knowledge and also helps you learn how to apply what you have learned. And at the same time I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">think it's very motivating to build something. At least for me I find it incredibly motivating to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">just build something cool that I find interesting. So that's another thing that I would definitely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">recommend on the Python side. So yeah that's a prerequisite almost or something you do in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">parallel to what I have here. So machine learning 101 is really kind of an introduction to machine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.040</a></span> | <span class="t">learning and where you would learn about key concepts. So you have neural networks up here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">loss optimization, activation functions, and there is a lot more than just that in there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So with all of these resources you can mostly get them for free. So neural networks from scratch is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">very good by Sendex. And Sendex in general is also very good especially when you're starting Python.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">That's probably another thing to add to the Python prerequisites. You can also learn from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Sendex. That's one of the places I learned as well. So neural networks from scratch is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">in my opinion a really good resource and it's one of those things that wasn't around when I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">learning this stuff but I really wish it had been. And so much so that I bought it anyway and it is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=333" target="_blank">00:05:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">genuinely incredible. Now you don't need to buy the book as well. The book is great and I like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">having something physical but you can also do all this stuff online as well. Or not all of it. I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=348" target="_blank">00:05:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">think the first parts of the book has already been covered on Sendex's YouTube channel. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=355" target="_blank">00:05:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">where are we? Where do we find that? I think it's just YouTube Sendex. Yeah so just Sendex.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can find on here he has here we are it's literally right at the top neural networks from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">scratch intro neural code. And this is really nice as well because you have a lot of visuals</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=372" target="_blank">00:06:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">in here and obviously Sendex is talking through it which is really nice. But of course also the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=378" target="_blank">00:06:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">book is is really incredible. And the reason I like it is because it's going through the code</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=386" target="_blank">00:06:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">of everything making everything very visual but breaking everything down. Because what you'll find</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=392" target="_blank">00:06:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">later on in machine learning that everything is very abstract but it's so important to understand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=398" target="_blank">00:06:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the core concepts behind all of these things. So we can see here like he's really breaking down</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=408" target="_blank">00:06:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">everything. So this looks horrible but this is a really nice way to actually just understand what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=415" target="_blank">00:06:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">is going on in a neural network. And then later on with like actually coding and keeping things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=422" target="_blank">00:07:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">really simple like inputs weights. And the issue is that in most cases most tutorials they go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=428" target="_blank">00:07:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">too abstract too quickly. Whereas in this book and on the video tutorials Sendex doesn't go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=440" target="_blank">00:07:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">too abstract too quickly. He builds it up from nothing which is really nice especially if you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=446" target="_blank">00:07:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">just starting out. So that's one in my opinion very good resource for when you're starting out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=452" target="_blank">00:07:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Another one that it seems almost like everyone in machine learning or data science has done this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=460" target="_blank">00:07:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">course at some point.

like I said</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=1049" target="_blank">00:17:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">incredible you have a nice little summary of the course here which I can't can I zoom in that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=1057" target="_blank">00:17:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">probably the closest I'm going to get so you have an introduction diving in and more advanced stuff</span></div><div class="c"><span

they have multiple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=1067" target="_blank">00:17:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">libraries for NLP transformers library datasets library tokenizers library they're all very good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=1074" target="_blank">00:17:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I would definitely recommend this as that sort of starting point or as the almost the foundation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=1082" target="_blank">00:18:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">of where you learn your modern NLP techniques so that's the modern NLP stuff and yeah as I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=1092" target="_blank">00:18:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">have written here I think at this point you're definitely in a good position to do some pretty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=1097" target="_blank">00:18:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">interesting projects so at this point I would expect you've probably done some projects anyway</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=1103" target="_blank">00:18:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">but if you haven't then for sure at this point you really should do some projects</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=1108" target="_blank">00:18:28.560</a></span> | <span class="t">so these are just projects that I've done in the past and actually showed you how to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=1115" target="_blank">00:18:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">on YouTube so there's building transform models from scratch I think this is really useful to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=1122" target="_blank">00:18:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">understand how all of this works and there's a few things in there so this is like a building an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=1130" target="_blank">00:18:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Italian BERT model from from scratch and now I do have other series as well on that sort of thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=1138" target="_blank">00:18:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and there's also another series I did here which again is the same it's like a Q&A app</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

least useful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=1153" target="_blank">00:19:13.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I hope as a guide or as inspiration to what sort of projects you can do so I mean that's really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=1159" target="_blank">00:19:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">you know when it comes to NLP that's probably as much as you want to go but I will mention</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=1164" target="_blank">00:19:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">of course a lot of what I do is going to sort of semantic search and information retrieval so if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=1171" target="_blank">00:19:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that's the sort of thing that you're interested in then of course there are other resources that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=1177" target="_blank">00:19:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">you can go through for that and these are all free if you want them to be free so the only one that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=1184" target="_blank">00:19:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">isn't sometimes free is this bug here which we'll talk about in a minute but there are these two</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=1189" target="_blank">00:19:49.680</a></span> | <span class="t">here which are just series that I've written and if you go on here you can see there's quite a line</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=1196" target="_blank">00:19:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">here and it's all free so it's quite I think it's it's a good deal so you come down and you can see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=1203" target="_blank">00:20:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">we have all these different chapters that really go through what we would call sentence transformers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=1211" target="_blank">00:20:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">semantic search and for me I think this is a really interesting sort of subdomain of NLP</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=1218" target="_blank">00:20:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and then here we're looking at vector search another important part of of information</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=1224" target="_blank">00:20:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">retrieval and I of course again be able to find a free link to this in the in the description</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=1230" target="_blank">00:20:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">you see it's a few parts here we're just introducing similarity search</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=1235" target="_blank">00:20:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">face and a few other things so again free course I think it's a good deal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=1243" target="_blank">00:20:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and then this is the final one so mining of massive data sets is a really cool book</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=1249" target="_blank">00:20:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">it's quite big as well it's this really interesting picture on the front here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=1255" target="_blank">00:20:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and this is this is definitely this is more like when you start getting into your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

honest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=1267" target="_blank">00:21:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">but there is so many interesting things it's almost like the it's like the theory of everything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=1276" target="_blank">00:21:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">that built up information retrieval and some obviously more advanced stuff as well</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=1289" target="_blank">00:21:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">a almost deeper level I would say though at the same time a lot of it you might not even find</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=1298"

definitely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=1311" target="_blank">00:21:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">useful when you're actually implementing these sort of things but that's another one that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVAJ_l_S7uQ&t=1316" target="_blank">00:21:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">really good but like I said you can also get that online for free which is really nice so if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
