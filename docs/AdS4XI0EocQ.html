And the idea that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdS4XI0EocQ&t=691" target="_blank">00:11:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I would be dwelling on it in some horrifying, wonderful way -- well, I'm protected by that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdS4XI0EocQ&t=695" target="_blank">00:11:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">by not reading it.

And Kevin told me about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdS4XI0EocQ&t=702" target="_blank">00:11:42.280</a></span> | <span class="t">it when someone called up and said -- the press or something said -- which they never</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdS4XI0EocQ&t=706" target="_blank">00:11:46.280</a></span> | <span class="t">did -- "What do you think of it, this nut?"

You've touched on this a number of times before,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdS4XI0EocQ&t=785" target="_blank">00:13:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">but he'd like an answer. How important is an international holding in the stock portion</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdS4XI0EocQ&t=790" target="_blank">00:13:10.280</a></span> | <span class="t">of a portfolio?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdS4XI0EocQ&t=792" target="_blank">00:13:12.280</a></span> | <span class="t">>> Well, I mean, I talked about that at some length.

But my skepticism about international, my idea that international</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdS4XI0EocQ&t=807" target="_blank">00:13:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">will not add a huge amount of value to your returns, is based on, first, financial markets</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdS4XI0EocQ&t=815" target="_blank">00:13:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">are a great arbitrage -- great way to arbitrage between the present and the future. So if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdS4XI0EocQ&t=820" target="_blank">00:13:40.280</a></span> | <span class="t">emerging markets are going to grow much faster in America, that's not going to be news to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdS4XI0EocQ&t=824" target="_blank">00:13:44.280</a></span> | <span class="t">people that own Brazil and China and Russia and South Korea and Taiwan.

But if you said, what's the matter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdS4XI0EocQ&t=1028" target="_blank">00:17:08.280</a></span> | <span class="t">with 20%?

I think, you know, this has become a product</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdS4XI0EocQ&t=1277" target="_blank">00:21:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">industry, and I banned the word product, Vanguard, when I was running it. And you have to pay</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdS4XI0EocQ&t=1282" target="_blank">00:21:22.280</a></span> | <span class="t">a $5 fine if you ever use such a word. And the reason for that is quite simple. We are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdS4XI0EocQ&t=1289" target="_blank">00:21:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">not in the business, or should not be in the business, of selling products. You know, that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdS4XI0EocQ&t=1293" target="_blank">00:21:33.280</a></span> | <span class="t">somebody else's business.

And that's not the business that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdS4XI0EocQ&t=1305" target="_blank">00:21:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">is the core of what Vanguard should be about. The word is crepe back in, and we use it all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdS4XI0EocQ&t=1310" target="_blank">00:21:50.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the time. I don't mean that in a too critical way, a little bit critical way, because there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdS4XI0EocQ&t=1315" target="_blank">00:21:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">aren't a thousand other words.

So, product is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdS4XI0EocQ&t=1324" target="_blank">00:22:04.280</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of a good word until you think about it.

It left,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdS4XI0EocQ&t=1331" target="_blank">00:22:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and, you know, it's just not a happy way to think about the business in which I find myself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdS4XI0EocQ&t=1338" target="_blank">00:22:18.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I think, I think you said the first part of the question of what retail products or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdS4XI0EocQ&t=1344" target="_blank">00:22:24.280</a></span> | <span class="t">services should we have to make available product for the retail investor. And I say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdS4XI0EocQ&t=1350" target="_blank">00:22:30.280</a></span> | <span class="t">less, less. Why do we need more?

Now, we've reached totally the wall. It's absolutely like going to Starbucks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdS4XI0EocQ&t=1364" target="_blank">00:22:44.280</a></span> | <span class="t">in the morning and getting that iced latte with blah, blah, blah.

Those of you who don't know. And so, I say less, and that's not going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdS4XI0EocQ&t=1384" target="_blank">00:23:04.280</a></span> | <span class="t">to happen. But the message I'm trying to send is don't complicate the job. And, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdS4XI0EocQ&t=1390" target="_blank">00:23:10.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the first rule of shooting is don't shoot yourself.

If you shoot somebody else, be sure you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdS4XI0EocQ&t=1402" target="_blank">00:23:22.280</a></span> | <span class="t">kill them. I have a philosophy for you. At Vanguard, you know, there are some things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdS4XI0EocQ&t=1416" target="_blank">00:23:36.280</a></span> | <span class="t">that can't be changed. We've gotten big. And I'm not a big company guy. I wouldn't work</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdS4XI0EocQ&t=1421" target="_blank">00:23:41.280</a></span> | <span class="t">for a big company. And we have, by the way, the most incredibly dedicated people at Vanguard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdS4XI0EocQ&t=1427" target="_blank">00:23:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">They have a high respect for me, even if I'm in the waning years of my life and career.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdS4XI0EocQ&t=1432" target="_blank">00:23:52.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And they enjoy being with me.

When I get one of these invitations,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdS4XI0EocQ&t=1441" target="_blank">00:24:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I say, "I'll be glad to come and talk to you all if the coast is clear, if you know what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdS4XI0EocQ&t=1444" target="_blank">00:24:04.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean."

Let me give you an example I often</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdS4XI0EocQ&t=1464" target="_blank">00:24:24.280</a></span> | <span class="t">talk about when, you know, when you talk to these crew members that I told you I did for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdS4XI0EocQ&t=1469" target="_blank">00:24:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">an hour at a time. Usually we don't have a time limit, but sometimes it goes longer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdS4XI0EocQ&t=1473" target="_blank">00:24:33.280</a></span> | <span class="t">but it seems about right.

And you'd never say, "Well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdS4XI0EocQ&t=1489" target="_blank">00:24:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">an hour's up, that's it." I mean, you just let it go until it kind of doesn't go anymore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdS4XI0EocQ&t=1493" target="_blank">00:24:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">But we talk about the rise of bureaucracy.

There's no way around that. Although I do observe that if the chief executive loves</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdS4XI0EocQ&t=1528" target="_blank">00:25:28.280</a></span> | <span class="t">process, it's going to be over here.
