It's disguised as an issue tracker, we like to say.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=48" target="_blank">00:00:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">We've spent the last five years obsessing over the speed, clarity, removing friction, making it just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=56" target="_blank">00:00:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the best tool for ICs to use to work every day. So yeah, it started as a simple tracker, and now we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=65" target="_blank">00:01:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">think of it as an operating system for engineering and product teams to build their products. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=71" target="_blank">00:01:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">we're used by OpenAI, Ramp, Vasell, thousands of other modern software companies you've heard of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=80" target="_blank">00:01:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and use Linear to kind of keep track of their work. So just a little bit of history of our AI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=89" target="_blank">00:01:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">journey, as it were. We spun up an internal Skunkworks team in early 2023, which I think was about GPT-3,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=99" target="_blank">00:01:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">if I remember rightly. Our initial focus was on kind of summarization, some similarity. We were looking at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=108" target="_blank">00:01:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">embeddings. Nobody on the team had any AI experience, so we're just kind of jumping in and figuring it out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=114" target="_blank">00:01:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">as we go. One of the things we realized really quickly was that many of the features that we needed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to build needed a really solid search foundation. Almost everything you need to first find the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">relevant stuff, right? So we had Elasticsearch at that time, and they didn't have a very good vector</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">offering. I think maybe they actually didn't have no vector offering back in 2023. So we looked around,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and this was kind of a moment where there was like a hundred startups suddenly came out with vector</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">databases, right? I was like, there's Pinecone, there was this, there was that. And so we looked at these,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">we evaluated a few. They all had a ton of trade-offs. And so we literally just ended up after experimenting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">with a bunch of things, and we had like OpenAI embeddings, and we stored them in PGVector, and we put the PGVector</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">on GCP, and it was like the most classic linear decision ever because it was so pragmatic and just used</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the solid things. So on that base, we shipped some features, right? We shipped a V1 of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">similar issues where we're kind of suggesting related issues. This was like, in hindsight,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">two years later, so naive. We were just doing simple cosine embedding comparisons against the vector</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">database. And we shipped natural language filters. Actually, I think this is one of the better ones,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">where you can just type in natural language bugs assigned to me in the last two weeks that are closed,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and it will produce the filter. So it's very one-shot, very naive in comparison. Yeah, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">pretty useful and kind of hidden, I would say, as well. We also have another feature where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.560</a></span> | <span class="t">if you create an issue from a Slack thread, we will not just pass the text from the Slack message. We will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">we will try and produce the right issue from that automatically. And that was like so seamless</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">and hidden that I think a lot of people didn't even realize it was happening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And we never shipped a co-pilot. We tried. It was like it was co-pilot season. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">we just the quality wasn't there. You know, we have this quality bar and it did not reach it. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know if it was a lack of imagination for our team because we weren't like AI-pilled enough at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">time, or it was like the capability of these early models. I think a bit of both, to be honest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, we -- I think this was the right approach at the time, in a way. Like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of people on Twitter kind of noticed. They're like, oh, these are very seamless features. You're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.640</a></span> | <span class="t">not slapping AI in our face. Like, there was literally toothbrushes that said they had AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's probably much worse now, to be honest. But, you know, people kind of appreciated this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.720</a></span> | <span class="t">approach of, like, small pragmatic value adds. And then, like, fast forward to 2024. And, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">we've added a few things since then. But it really feels like at 2024, the end of 2024, we hit a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">turning point. You know, 03 coming out, the planning and reasoning models, the multimodal capabilities</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">became available in the APIs. The context windows went through the roof. You know, have, like, million</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">token contexts. Like, you can do crazy things with that. DeepSeq, of course, made a splash. And we felt</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">like some of our experiments started to become a lot less brittle. And things actually felt smart.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Things kind of clicked for the team a little bit more. We saw how deep this could go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first thing we did was we started by rebuilding our search index again. Which, I don't know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">if you ever, like, backfilled, like, millions -- hundreds of millions of rows of embeddings,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it takes a while. So we moved to a hybrid search approach. This was something that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">we had really felt was lacking over, like, the year and a half, that we kind of had PG Vector sat on its</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">own. And we weren't -- we didn't put it in our main database because it was so huge. So it was kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">sat in its own thing. So we moved to Turbo Puffer. If you've not heard of Turbo Puffer, really, really cool</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=347" target="_blank">00:05:47.520</a></span> | <span class="t">search index, I'd highly recommend giving it a look. And we moved our embeddings over to Cohere. After</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.720</a></span> | <span class="t">doing kind of a comparison, we felt that they were a lot better for our domain, at least, than OpenAI's.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So this kind of filled a gap in the search. And this is actually just finished rolling out in, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the last two weeks because the backfill took such a while. But now we thought, okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=372" target="_blank">00:06:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">we've got a really solid search foundation. What are we going to do with this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=375" target="_blank">00:06:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So first thing we did is, like, we're building this feature called Product Intelligence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">This is basically, like, similar issues V2. So instead of just doing simple cosine matching,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=387" target="_blank">00:06:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">We now have a pipeline. That pipeline is using query rewriting. It's using the hybrid search engine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">It's re-ranking the results. We're using deterministic rules. And then out the other side,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=398" target="_blank">00:06:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">what we get is a map of relationships from any given issue to its related issues. And then how they are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.560</a></span> | <span class="t">related and the why they are related. And then what we're able to do with that is expose this in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=414" target="_blank">00:06:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">product. I hope that's clear enough as, you know, we have suggested labels, suggested assignees,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=420" target="_blank">00:07:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">possible duplicates. And then on things like projects, it's like why this might be the right person to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=428" target="_blank">00:07:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">work on this issue or why this might be the right project for this. So, you know, we're working with,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=433" target="_blank">00:07:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">like, the open AIs of the world. They have thousands of tickets coming in. And they really have to have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=437" target="_blank">00:07:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">as much help as possible to kind of churn through them and get them into the right, the hands of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=442" target="_blank">00:07:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">right engineers. I think I skipped one. Yeah. So the next one was customer feedback analysis. This is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=450" target="_blank">00:07:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">something we're working on right now. So one of the other features of Linear is you can bring in all of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=454" target="_blank">00:07:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the customer feedback from all of your channels and then use that to help to decide what you're going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=461" target="_blank">00:07:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">build. And so obviously one of the steps there is, okay, we have hundreds of pieces of feedback.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=466" target="_blank">00:07:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">How do we figure out what to build from this, right? So of course, LLMs are great at analyzing text.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=473" target="_blank">00:07:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And we found that I think our head of product actually said that our analysis was able to beat</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=481" target="_blank">00:08:01.040</a></span> | <span class="t">90% of the candidates he talks to in the interview process for what they're able to do in terms of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=487" target="_blank">00:08:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">analysis. So we're able to, yes, churn through hundreds or thousands of customer requests and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=492" target="_blank">00:08:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">figure out for this given project, like, how might we split this up, what features might be created from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=497" target="_blank">00:08:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">this, which is pretty cool. Another feature we've already shipped is a daily or weekly pulse. This</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=505" target="_blank">00:08:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">synthesizes all of the updates that are happening in your workspace, creates a pulse from it, like a summarized</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=514" target="_blank">00:08:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">pulse. And then we also produce, like, an audio podcast version, which is pretty cool, because you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=519" target="_blank">00:08:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">can pull open our mobile app and then listen to that on your commute. I hope we have an RSS feed for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=524" target="_blank">00:08:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">it soon. I really want to just subscribe to it in a podcast player. So although I put podcast here, it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=529" target="_blank">00:08:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">not quite a podcast. You have to have a mobile app or the desktop app. But this is great. You just, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=534" target="_blank">00:08:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">over breakfast, like, what has the team been up to while I was asleep. Oh, that was a -- sorry. That's the visual of it. Apologies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=543" target="_blank">00:09:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Apologies. And then, yeah. So one other feature I'll go through here is this issue from video. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=554" target="_blank">00:09:14.240</a></span> | <span class="t">literally, so many bugs come in as video recordings from customers, right? Drop the video. We'll analyze</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=561" target="_blank">00:09:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">it. We'll figure out the reproduction steps. And then we'll create the issue for you from that. This is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=567" target="_blank">00:09:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe not the finest example of the feature, but another kind of, like, seamless but very powerful and saves a bunch of time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=574" target="_blank">00:09:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, of course, we're baking as much into the platform as we can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=580" target="_blank">00:09:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">in terms of these things. But there's a limit to that, right? We can't put in everything. We don't know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=587" target="_blank">00:09:47.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Every team is different. Every team is shaped differently. So we want to make this pluggable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=592" target="_blank">00:09:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is kind of where agents come in. So the way we're thinking about agents is as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=596" target="_blank">00:09:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">infinitely scalable cloud-based teammates. So we launched a platform for this two weeks ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=602" target="_blank">00:10:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">We figure, you know, we're already doing a pretty good job of orchestrating humans.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=607" target="_blank">00:10:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">We are a communication tool for humans, after all. And if agents are going to be members of your team</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=614" target="_blank">00:10:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">going forward, then they should also live in the same place where all of the human communication happens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=620" target="_blank">00:10:20.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So first, hopefully, if the internet stands up, I'm tethering. I'll do some -- I've got some videos.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=627" target="_blank">00:10:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So CodeGen is one of the first coding agents that integrated with us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=634" target="_blank">00:10:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So they can -- is this going to play? Cool. Yeah. So CodeGen, you can assign it. You can mention it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=642" target="_blank">00:10:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">inside of Linear like any other user. And it will produce plans. It will produce PRs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=649" target="_blank">00:10:49.360</a></span> | <span class="t">You can see here. It's going to pop in -- boop. This is a sped up, by the way. That took four minutes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=654" target="_blank">00:10:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">not 20 seconds. But, yes, it will produce the PR. And then you can go and review it like you would any</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=659" target="_blank">00:10:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">other -- any other worker -- any other team member.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=663" target="_blank">00:11:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">This is really powerful, by the way. And you can -- because it's an agentic system in the background,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=671" target="_blank">00:11:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">you can also interact with it from -- not just from within Linear, but from within Slack or from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=677" target="_blank">00:11:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">other communication tools. And you can say, go and fix this ticket and give it a linear issue,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=682" target="_blank">00:11:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and it will know how to connect it all up. Or you'll be able to interrupt it part way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=687" target="_blank">00:11:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Bucket is a feature flagging platform that integrated with the first version of our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=694" target="_blank">00:11:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">agents platform here. Let's see. Is this going to -- oh, no.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=698" target="_blank">00:11:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">All righty. Yeah. So in this case, you can just mention the bucket agent, tell it to create a flag.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=705" target="_blank">00:11:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">It will create a feature flag for you. You can roll it out. You can check the status of things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=710" target="_blank">00:11:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">all within here. And, of course, because it's agentic, you don't have to go command by command.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=714" target="_blank">00:11:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You can say, create a new flag, roll it out to 30% of users, and things like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=720" target="_blank">00:12:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then Charlie is another coding agent with access to your repository. It's really good at creating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=727" target="_blank">00:12:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">plans and doing, like, root calls analysis of bugs. So in this case, we have an issue here. It has a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=735" target="_blank">00:12:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">sentry issue attached. We can just mention Charlie, ask it to do some research. So it can go and look at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=743" target="_blank">00:12:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">your recent commits. It can go look through the code base. And it can kind of figure out the cause of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=749" target="_blank">00:12:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">this issue. And you can imagine immediately, right, like, this has saved a lot of minutes of engineer's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=755" target="_blank">00:12:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">time. They can come in here and immediately see possible causes and regression reasons for this issue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=761" target="_blank">00:12:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So the examples I've shown so far have been kind of living in the common area of an issue. Obviously,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=770" target="_blank">00:12:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that's not quite where we want to be in the long term. So, you know, we're working on building</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=776" target="_blank">00:12:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">additional surfaces for this in the product so that agents aren't just, like, the same as users on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=784" target="_blank">00:13:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">team. They're kind of better because you can see what they're thinking. And I can't see what my teammates</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=789" target="_blank">00:13:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">are thinking a lot of the time. So, yeah. So we'll have this surface where the agents can send you their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=794" target="_blank">00:13:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">observations. They can send you the tool calls. You're able to kind of go behind the scenes of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=799" target="_blank">00:13:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">agent. You'll be able to interrupt it. And then this is kind of consistent across the whole workspace,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=807" target="_blank">00:13:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">right? So you have different coding agents. You have PM agents. One other company that's building an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=814" target="_blank">00:13:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">integration with us right now is intercom with the Fin agent. So you'll be able to do things like just say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=819" target="_blank">00:13:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">hey, Fin, I fixed this bug. Can you go and reply to the 100 customers that reported it? And, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=825" target="_blank">00:13:45.840</a></span> | <span class="t">how much time did that just save? So we're building this interface out right now. And I expect to have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=830" target="_blank">00:13:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">it in a couple of weeks. But I've been really using these features a ton. And I've been hammering</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=837" target="_blank">00:13:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">this for months. And I think it really changes the game. And we'll expect kind of the amount of bugs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=842" target="_blank">00:14:02.560</a></span> | <span class="t">sitting in companies' backlogs, which we kind of take for granted that you have this giant backlog</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=846" target="_blank">00:14:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that you're never going to get to the bottom of. I think there's just not going to be an excuse for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=850" target="_blank">00:14:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">that anymore. The agents can tackle it for you. There's nothing to stop you assigning every single</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=858" target="_blank">00:14:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">issue in your backlog out to an agent. Have it do a first pass. Maybe 50% of them will be fixed by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=862" target="_blank">00:14:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the end of the week. So I think, yes, we're really in this world now where you can build more. You can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=868" target="_blank">00:14:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">build higher quality because more of the grunt work is being done. And you can build faster.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=873" target="_blank">00:14:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">How much time we got? So I'll just talk a little bit about, like, the architecture of this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=881" target="_blank">00:14:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So, yeah, in Linear, agents are first-class users. They have identity. They have history. You can see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=888" target="_blank">00:14:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">everything they do. There's a full audit trail of those events. You install them via OAuth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=894" target="_blank">00:14:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And then once they're installed, kind of any admin on the team can manage that agent and its access.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=903" target="_blank">00:15:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And they work fully transparently.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=905" target="_blank">00:15:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have a very mature GraphQL API at this point, which basically enables agents to do anything in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=915" target="_blank">00:15:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">product that a human could do and granular scopes. And then we added brand new webhooks for this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=922" target="_blank">00:15:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">specifically, where if you are developing an agent with Linear, you will get webhooks when events happen</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=929" target="_blank">00:15:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">that are specific to your agent. So somebody replies to your agent. Your agent was triggered on this issue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=936" target="_blank">00:15:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">We also added some additional scopes that you can opt into to choose whether your agent is mentionable or assignable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=945" target="_blank">00:15:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, as part of that kind of future UI that I just showed, we're also working on a new SDK to be released at the same time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=952" target="_blank">00:15:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">which will just make that really, really easy where you can -- so right now you can build all this stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=957" target="_blank">00:15:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">It's on our existing API. And you kind of have to figure out a bit more, I would say. So we're kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=963" target="_blank">00:16:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">building this abstraction layer, this sugar, where you can very, very easily integrate with the platform.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=973" target="_blank">00:16:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So, yeah, I'll finish with some of the best practices that we found working with these partners over the last</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=981" target="_blank">00:16:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">couple of months. You know, it really felt like we're kind of on the cutting edge here, and we're building it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=988" target="_blank">00:16:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">as the agents themselves still haven't launched in a lot of ways. You know, like Google and Codex only just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=993" target="_blank">00:16:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">launched those within the last couple of weeks. So first is to be -- to respond very quickly and very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=1002" target="_blank">00:16:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">precisely when folks trigger your agent. So if I mention your agent, it should respond as fast as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=1009" target="_blank">00:16:49.760</a></span> | <span class="t">possible. A lot of what we've seen is people using emoji reactions for that right now. Excuse me, I have to cough.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=1015" target="_blank">00:16:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so -- and then respond in a way that kind of like reassures the user that you -- the agent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=1026" target="_blank">00:17:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">understood the request. You know, so it's like if you say at CodeGen, can you take care of this? The response</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=1033" target="_blank">00:17:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">should be like something -- I will produce a PR for this specific thing you asked me. It's like, okay, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=1037" target="_blank">00:17:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">understood what I meant. Great. Inhabit the platform. This is like linear specific a little bit, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=1045" target="_blank">00:17:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">in this example, but I think it applies anywhere. We really expect that these agents are not linear</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=1052" target="_blank">00:17:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">agents. They are the agents that live in the cloud, and one of the ways that they interact is through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=1057" target="_blank">00:17:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">linear, right? It's just another -- it's a window into their behavior and hopefully like a really well</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=1062" target="_blank">00:17:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">structured one where they get a lot of context, but we really think that, you know, if you're working</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=1068" target="_blank">00:17:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">within -- if you're working within Slack, you should use the language of those platforms and not confuse</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=1072" target="_blank">00:17:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">things and put great effort into that. And then things like -- one of the things that we expect to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=1079" target="_blank">00:17:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">happen inside of linear is if you're working on an issue, you should move that issue to in progress.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=1084" target="_blank">00:18:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Don't just leave it in the backlog. You expect that of your teammates, and we expect that of agents as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=1088" target="_blank">00:18:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">well. And then just, again, like natural behavior. So if somebody triggered you and then they replied</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=1097" target="_blank">00:18:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">in that thread, you shouldn't need to mention the agent again to get a response. It should be a natural</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=1102" target="_blank">00:18:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">behavior that if you reply to them, they will respond.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=1111" target="_blank">00:18:31.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, don't be clever. Clarify your intent before acting. I think we see a lot of like attempts at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=1118" target="_blank">00:18:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">one shots. One pattern that we're seeing right now coming out of a lot of the coding agents is they'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=1124" target="_blank">00:18:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">form a plan before doing anything and communicate that plan up front and get clarification on it. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=1132" target="_blank">00:18:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that's something that we definitely expect to happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=1135" target="_blank">00:18:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And finally, you know, be sure you're adding value. I think, you know, LLMs, they love to just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=1145" target="_blank">00:19:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">produce tons of text. We don't want to see splats straight out of OpenAI into comments, into issues,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=1152" target="_blank">00:19:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">into any other services. Be concise. Be useful. Be like a good teammate would be. You can always fall</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=1160" target="_blank">00:19:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">back on asking, like, what would a human do in this situation? And try your best to achieve that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9IAdmi2Dg&t=1165" target="_blank">00:19:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Cool.
