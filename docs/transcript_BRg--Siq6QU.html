And this is really, really an important principle, because life is not fair. Some people have better advantages than you, wealthier parents.</p><p>Some people are stronger, naturally smarter. Whatever the case may be, the playing field is never, ever, ever fair, and we have to accept that. If we never fail due to a lack of effort, that means we are always going to try our best, and if we lose, it's not going to be because we didn't try our best.</p><p>It can be because the opponent was faster, quicker, smarter, whatever it is, more connected. But if we do our best, we're always going to be satisfied, and we'll never look back with regret, having not tried our best.</p></div></div></body></html>
