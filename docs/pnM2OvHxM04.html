First up today, we have a question from Yajur, I think is the best pronunciation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnM2OvHxM04&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I can do.

Has the bond market ever been wrong? Any notable examples? If</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnM2OvHxM04&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.600</a></span> | <span class="t">so, why was it wrong?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnM2OvHxM04&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.240</a></span> | <span class="t">The bond market generally is known to be smarter than the stock market. But yes, the bond market</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnM2OvHxM04&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.560</a></span> | <span class="t">gets it wrong. You don't have to go back very far in history to figure this out. The bond</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnM2OvHxM04&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.760</a></span> | <span class="t">market totally missed inflation, much like most people. The bond market did not see this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnM2OvHxM04&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">pandemic-induced inflation coming just like the Fed. Think about it. At the end of 2021,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnM2OvHxM04&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.420</a></span> | <span class="t">this is less than a year ago, the 10-year treasure was still yielding 1.5%.

So the bond market was completely off sides.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnM2OvHxM04&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that's one of the biggest reasons we've had this huge adjustment in rates this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnM2OvHxM04&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.740</a></span> | <span class="t">year is because the bond market had to play catch-up. Now, you could blame the Fed for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnM2OvHxM04&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that stuff, right? The Fed was telling us all that inflation was going to be transitory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnM2OvHxM04&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">It wasn't going to last very long.

So maybe the bond market was taking its marching orders from the Feds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnM2OvHxM04&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But I guess if you're in the camp that rates are all manipulated by the Fed and the Fed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnM2OvHxM04&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.840</a></span> | <span class="t">is doing all this stuff, can you really look to the bond market to be this predictor of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnM2OvHxM04&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">what's going to happen in the economy?

So sure, the Fed controls short-term</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnM2OvHxM04&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.160</a></span> | <span class="t">yields, right? But that's only on the very short end of the curve. You also have to think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnM2OvHxM04&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.080</a></span> | <span class="t">of things like supply and demand for bonds and based on investor demand for those. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnM2OvHxM04&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.640</a></span> | <span class="t">there are inflation expectations and expectations for future Fed moves, expectations for economic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnM2OvHxM04&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.160</a></span> | <span class="t">growth and maybe some price yield trends that's going on if you're a technical trader, I guess.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnM2OvHxM04&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I think if you add all this up, one of the things that's confusing for people who don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnM2OvHxM04&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">pay attention to the bond market is, you get bond yields moving, but they don't always</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnM2OvHxM04&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.960</a></span> | <span class="t">move in the same direction at the same magnitude, right? So John, throw on the chart of 10-year</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnM2OvHxM04&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Treasury yields versus 3-month T-bills. So this is over time. You can see directionally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnM2OvHxM04&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.560</a></span> | <span class="t">they're fairly similar. So 3-month T-bills are essentially, think of them as like savings</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnM2OvHxM04&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">account yields. It's kind of a good proxy for the Fed funds rate that they use to sort</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnM2OvHxM04&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">of do monetary policy by raising and lowering rates. But this is like a savings account</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnM2OvHxM04&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">yield, or a CD rate. You can see right now, at like 4.3%, 3-month T-bills are yielding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnM2OvHxM04&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">almost 80 basis points more than the 10-year Treasury yield. That, we talked about in an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnM2OvHxM04&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">inverted yield curve last week.

So this is not normal. The hard part here is the Fed is effectively inverting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnM2OvHxM04&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the yield curve, right? They're raising short-term rates, and the long end of the curve is saying,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnM2OvHxM04&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.120</a></span> | <span class="t">"I don't care," right?

Let's look through a simple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnM2OvHxM04&t=825" target="_blank">00:13:45.700</a></span> | <span class="t">example, Duncan. So let's think about the relative attractiveness. If you own a 4% bond</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnM2OvHxM04&t=830" target="_blank">00:13:50.100</a></span> | <span class="t">right now and rates go to 5%, your 4% bond has to be worth less if you want someone else</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnM2OvHxM04&t=835" target="_blank">00:13:55.980</a></span> | <span class="t">to buy it because you can get 5% of the market. So you're going to get less interest, so you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnM2OvHxM04&t=840" target="_blank">00:14:00.140</a></span> | <span class="t">going to have to charge a discount if someone wants to buy that to give them a higher implicit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnM2OvHxM04&t=844" target="_blank">00:14:04.380</a></span> | <span class="t">rate, right? Now let's say rates go to 3%. Well, now your 4% bond is going to be worth</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnM2OvHxM04&t=848" target="_blank">00:14:08.660</a></span> | <span class="t">more relatively because you have a higher rate.

That make sense? Okay. So the most important thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnM2OvHxM04&t=893" target="_blank">00:14:53.420</a></span> | <span class="t">you need to know about duration is the higher the number, the more volatility in your bonds,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnM2OvHxM04&t=896" target="_blank">00:14:56.300</a></span> | <span class="t">all else equal. So let's say you have a bond portfolio with a 5-year duration. What this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnM2OvHxM04&t=900" target="_blank">00:15:00.620</a></span> | <span class="t">tells us is that you can expect a 5% change in price for every 1% change in yield. Yield</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnM2OvHxM04&t=907" target="_blank">00:15:07.180</a></span> | <span class="t">goes up 1%, you should expect your bond to roughly go down 5%. Yield goes down 1%, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnM2OvHxM04&t=912" target="_blank">00:15:12.420</a></span> | <span class="t">should expect your bond to go up roughly 5%. It's not exactly that, but it's pretty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnM2OvHxM04&t=917" target="_blank">00:15:17.140</a></span> | <span class="t">darn close. There's some other intricacies involved in here, but that's the gist of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnM2OvHxM04&t=921" target="_blank">00:15:21.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.

John, let's do a chart on a zero coupon bond to show an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnM2OvHxM04&t=929" target="_blank">00:15:29.500</a></span> | <span class="t">example here. This is the extremes. Zero coupon bonds are all duration because you don't get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnM2OvHxM04&t=934" target="_blank">00:15:34.500</a></span> | <span class="t">paid income over time.

So zero coupon bonds are literally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnM2OvHxM04&t=941" target="_blank">00:15:41.540</a></span> | <span class="t">all duration. This is the 25 plus year PIMCO one. You can see it's rallied lately, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnM2OvHxM04&t=945" target="_blank">00:15:45.940</a></span> | <span class="t">it's down 34% this year.
