We, there is a bunch of empirical research on tutoring. And one of the questions they ask is like, what kind of experience level do the tutors need to have?</p><p>And it's interesting, like how far you get in tutoring efficacy when the tutor doesn't necessarily know anything. Just having like another warm body there actually contributes a very large effect. No, I mean, things get better as you get an expert. And I have a healthy skepticism of these studies.</p><p>Like I think part of the role of having Aristotle as a tutor is communicating a worldview. It's not something that would show up on a, you know, a test or something that these studies would be measuring. And so having an extremely inspiring individual might actually be the important component and inspiring is going to be highly correlated with expensive.</p><p>I think not necessarily. I don't know. That feels complicated.</p></div></div></body></html>
