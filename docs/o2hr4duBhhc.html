She will abort it. Now, that's an insane decision</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=29" target="_blank">00:00:29.300</a></span> | <span class="t">made by the female here, right? Because she's invested quite a lot in this, right? In biological</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=34" target="_blank">00:00:34.500</a></span> | <span class="t">terms and in forming this pregnancy and maintaining it. And yet she drops it on the basis of an odor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=41" target="_blank">00:00:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And this effect is remarkably robust. And what do I mean by remarkably robust? So this will occur</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=49" target="_blank">00:00:49.540</a></span> | <span class="t">on about 80% of exposures. Now, as you know, 80% is 100% in biology, right? I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=55" target="_blank">00:00:55.620</a></span> | <span class="t">there's nothing that happens at more than 80%. So it's a remarkably robust effect, this dropping</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=64" target="_blank">00:01:04.660</a></span> | <span class="t">of the pregnancy. And we know it's mediated by chemo sensation through the nose.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=68" target="_blank">00:01:08.740</a></span> | <span class="t">For sure. And we know in the following way. So first, it's enough to just bring the odor of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=74" target="_blank">00:01:14.580</a></span> | <span class="t">non-stud male. You don't have to bring the male himself, right? So you just can bring bedding from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.460</a></span> | <span class="t">a non-stud male and that will induce the Bruce effect. But of course, the most telling set of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=85" target="_blank">00:01:25.380</a></span> | <span class="t">experiments is that if in the female mouse, you ablate the vomeronasal organ, you just burn this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.300</a></span> | <span class="t">tiny structure in the nose, and the effect disappears. So the effect is completely dependent on the former</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=97" target="_blank">00:01:37.220</a></span> | <span class="t">nasal organ. And I find this utterly a remarkable effect, right? I mean, because again, because of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=104" target="_blank">00:01:44.980</a></span> | <span class="t">extent of cost that the female takes on here, based on this information and smell.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=114" target="_blank">00:01:54.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, humans, the sort of the going notion in olfaction is that humans don't have a functional</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.420</a></span> | <span class="t">vomeronasal organ. So we don't have that functional organ in our nose. Now I'll point out, we actually do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=129" target="_blank">00:02:09.940</a></span> | <span class="t">have the pit. So the structure or the outlining structure is there. But the pit that we have is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=139" target="_blank">00:02:19.940</a></span> | <span class="t">considered vestigial and non-functional. And what about this thing I learned about at Berkeley in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.220</a></span> | <span class="t">integrative biology class that we have something called Jacobson's organ? This is the same organ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So Jacobson organs is the vomeronasal organ. It's also called Jacobson because I think Jacobson was a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.500</a></span> | <span class="t">military physician in like the 1800s in Holland or something. And he found it in a soldier he was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.220</a></span> | <span class="t">operating on or something like that. But the story comes from something like that. But the Jacobson</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.820</a></span> | <span class="t">organ is another name for the vomeronasal organ. These are one in the same, the sensory organ of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.340</a></span> | <span class="t">accessory olfactory system. And again, the going notion is that the human Jacobson organ or vomeronasal organ</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.540</a></span> | <span class="t">is vestigial. It's non-functional. Does that necessarily mean that we don't have these pheromone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.580</a></span> | <span class="t">effects? No, it does not. So first of all, we know that lots of what are considered pheromonal effects,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.860</a></span> | <span class="t">namely social chemo signaling in rodents, are mediated by the main olfactory system. We know that for sure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.260</a></span> | <span class="t">There are several examples for this in mice and rats and rabbits and so on and so forth. So A,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.380</a></span> | <span class="t">these can be mediated by the main olfactory system. And I'll come back to that in a second. But first to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.180</a></span> | <span class="t">finish the Bruce effect. And second, and I'm going out on a limb here, but I'm willing to take that risk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.980</a></span> | <span class="t">For me, the jury is still out on human vomeronasal organ. The decision or the notion</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.300</a></span> | <span class="t">that it's non-functional relies on about one and a half papers, post-mortem, looking for the nerve</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.900</a></span> | <span class="t">that connects this thing to the brain and failing to find it using staining and so on and so forth. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.740</a></span> | <span class="t">staining post-mortem studies in humans are notoriously complicated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Basically, you know, for many reasons, one of them is that the material is just always</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.700</a></span> | <span class="t">has gone through, you know, it's not ideally set as it is when you sacrifice an animal and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.540</a></span> | <span class="t">and study its tissue. So based on really, really a paucity of studies that fail to find</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.820</a></span> | <span class="t">this nerve, the notion is that the structure is vestigial in humans. I don't have any evidence that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.140</a></span> | <span class="t">it's functional, mind you, but I'm just not sure that it's not. But what we do have a suspicion</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.180</a></span> | <span class="t">is that humans may experience something similar to Bruce effect. So, first of all, humans have an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.060</a></span> | <span class="t">enormous number or ratio of spontaneous miscarriage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.140</a></span> | <span class="t">- Are they occurring more often in the first trimester? Because you mentioned that in the Bruce</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=322" target="_blank">00:05:22.580</a></span> | <span class="t">effect in the mice is in the first three days or so following pregnancy, which in the mouse gestation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.300</a></span> | <span class="t">as I recall, is about 21 days in the mouse. You're talking about one seventh of total gestation. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.300</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not quick enough to, nor is it important to translate, but this would be first trimester.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.020</a></span> | <span class="t">- Yes, which is indeed when most miscarriage occurs. Now, humans have, again, a huge number of miscarriages</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.780</a></span> | <span class="t">and the numbers, I'll soon share them with you, they sound odd. And the reason they sound odd is because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.340</a></span> | <span class="t">if you have what's sometimes simply referred to as failed implantation, right, this can occur, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=356" target="_blank">00:05:56.500</a></span> | <span class="t">in days one, two, nobody ever knows. Okay, so some papers talk about 90% of all human pregnancies end</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.140</a></span> | <span class="t">in miscarriage. This is counting a failed implantation in day one, two, et cetera. More conservative studies</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=372" target="_blank">00:06:12.020</a></span> | <span class="t">talk about 50%. Nobody will argue 30%. Okay, so a huge number, a huge number of human pregnancies end in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.460</a></span> | <span class="t">miscarriage. Now, out of these, there's a portion that are unexplained, right? So nobody knows why.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.420</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, there are portions that are explained by all sorts of genetic factors, developmental factors,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.500</a></span> | <span class="t">and so on and so forth. But there's also a proportion that are unexplained. And so all I'm saying is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.780</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a statistical backdrop or setting, if you will, for something like a remnant Bruce effect in humans.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, with that in mind, we approached a group of, we enlisted a group of, they're not really patients</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=420" target="_blank">00:07:00.020</a></span> | <span class="t">and participants in a study of people who couples who are experiencing what is referred to as is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=426" target="_blank">00:07:06.340</a></span> | <span class="t">unexplained repeated pregnancy loss. So formally, if you have two consecutive unexplained miscarriages,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=435" target="_blank">00:07:15.620</a></span> | <span class="t">then that is sufficient for the diagnosis of unexplained repeated pregnancy loss. However,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=441" target="_blank">00:07:21.700</a></span> | <span class="t">in our cohort of 30, we had couples who experienced 12 consecutive unexplained repeated pregnancy losses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=450" target="_blank">00:07:30.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So the two is just the formal, all of our cohort was like 12, five, you know, so this is an emotional,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=458" target="_blank">00:07:38.180</a></span> | <span class="t">difficult place to be. And these are couples who are losing their pregnancy for no apparent reason.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=465" target="_blank">00:07:45.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So they've gone through all the tests that you can imagine of, you know, genetic incompatibilities and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=470" target="_blank">00:07:50.820</a></span> | <span class="t">all sorts of issues, clotting, all the known suspects for pregnancy loss. And the medical establishment remains</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=479" target="_blank">00:07:59.540</a></span> | <span class="t">totally at a loss as to why these pregnancies aren't holding. And so we hypothesized that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=486" target="_blank">00:08:06.260</a></span> | <span class="t">that perhaps here, there's something akin to a Bruce type effect. Obviously, it's not going to be the same</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=491" target="_blank">00:08:11.780</a></span> | <span class="t">as in mice, but, but something like a Bruce effect. Now, of course, at that stage, we could not do anything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=497" target="_blank">00:08:17.940</a></span> | <span class="t">causal to test this, right. But what we could do is to see, you know, to seek circumstantial evidence to see if,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=505" target="_blank">00:08:25.780</a></span> | <span class="t">if where there's fire, maybe there's smoke. And what we did was we tested,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=512" target="_blank">00:08:32.180</a></span> | <span class="t">all faction and more specifically, the response to male body odor in, in the couples experiencing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=522" target="_blank">00:08:42.180</a></span> | <span class="t">repeated pregnancy loss. And we found a few things. First of all, if you think of the mechanisms behind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=533" target="_blank">00:08:53.220</a></span> | <span class="t">the Bruce effect, the Bruce effect implies that the female has to have a very clear memory</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=540" target="_blank">00:09:00.580</a></span> | <span class="t">of the fathering male, because if she's going to miscarry in response to the nonfather, she has to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=546" target="_blank">00:09:06.980</a></span> | <span class="t">know father, nonfather. I mean, that means that there's a pronounced olfactory memory at the moment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=555" target="_blank">00:09:15.140</a></span> | <span class="t">of mating. Okay, and in mice, this has been very well characterized and attributed to the anterior</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=561" target="_blank">00:09:21.860</a></span> | <span class="t">olfactory nucleus structure in the brain. But you'd have to have this memory in order to make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=570" target="_blank">00:09:30.420</a></span> | <span class="t">that decision. Now, so to address that, and here you're going to see that you and your childhood</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=575" target="_blank">00:09:35.940</a></span> | <span class="t">story from before stand out a bit as skillful, is that the first thing we did was just behaviorally test</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=583" target="_blank">00:09:43.700</a></span> | <span class="t">whether these women and control women could identify the smell of their spouse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=597" target="_blank">00:09:57.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And you might be disappointed or, you know, we would all are probably a bit disappointed to learn</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=603" target="_blank">00:10:03.780</a></span> | <span class="t">that control women are very poor at this. So you would think that women would be good at identifying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=611" target="_blank">00:10:11.540</a></span> | <span class="t">the body odor of their spouse. They're not. They're not far from chance. However, the women who experience</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=622" target="_blank">00:10:22.580</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, repeated pregnancy loss are more than, they're, they're double, um, at their performance level.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=629" target="_blank">00:10:29.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is not a nuance effect. Uh, women who, who, who, who experience repeated, uh, pregnancy loss</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=636" target="_blank">00:10:36.180</a></span> | <span class="t">can identify, uh, their husbands or their spouses, uh, by their body odor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=642" target="_blank">00:10:42.020</a></span> | <span class="t">With much greater acuity than the typical person? Double. A bit more than double. And, and way above</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=648" target="_blank">00:10:48.660</a></span> | <span class="t">chance. Yeah, no, I, I, sorry, I posed it as a question, but I meant, yes, with much greater acuity,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=654" target="_blank">00:10:54.180</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, and double is, is a significant, um, improvement. Are they much better at detecting any odor?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=661" target="_blank">00:11:01.620</a></span> | <span class="t">No, they're not. We did the controls and they're not. And then, um, we also measured using fMRI. We</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=669" target="_blank">00:11:09.460</a></span> | <span class="t">measured their, their brain response to, uh, stranger male body odor. And there, and, and, and this was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=677" target="_blank">00:11:17.620</a></span> | <span class="t">quite remarkable because, you know, we approached, so this was a full brain analysis. So without a region</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=683" target="_blank">00:11:23.220</a></span> | <span class="t">of interest analysis. So it's not as if you're, uh, tweaking your statistics to look at one part of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=688" target="_blank">00:11:28.580</a></span> | <span class="t">brain, you're just looking at the entire brain in the response to male body order and asking,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=693" target="_blank">00:11:33.140</a></span> | <span class="t">de novo, is there a difference between these two groups of participants? And there was one huge</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=697" target="_blank">00:11:37.380</a></span> | <span class="t">difference and it was in the hypothalamus. And so there was a difference in response to stranger male</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=703" target="_blank">00:11:43.060</a></span> | <span class="t">body order, uh, between the two groups. Um, so, so olfaction is altered in spontaneous, repeated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=712" target="_blank">00:11:52.900</a></span> | <span class="t">spontaneous, uh, pregnancy loss. We don't know this is causal, right? Uh, but, but that was enough</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hr4duBhhc&t=720" target="_blank">00:12:00.340</a></span> | <span class="t">for us to approach the ethics committee, um, to run a causal experiment.
