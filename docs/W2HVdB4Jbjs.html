So I'm going to do a very quick evolution of what we've been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=89" target="_blank">00:01:29.340</a></span> | <span class="t">seeing for the past two to three years. We started off with chatbots, LLM power chatbots. They were great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=96" target="_blank">00:01:36.100</a></span> | <span class="t">chatbots came out in November 2022. And yeah, exploded. Then we went into RAG. We gave this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=104" target="_blank">00:01:44.340</a></span> | <span class="t">chatbots more domain-specific relevant knowledge. And they gave us more personalized responses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=108" target="_blank">00:01:48.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Then we began to scale the compute, the data we're giving to the LLMs. And it gave us emerging capabilities,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.420</a></span> | <span class="t">reasoning, tool use. Now we're in the world of AI agents and agentic systems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And the big debate is what is an agent? What is an AI agent? I don't like to go into that debate because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.300</a></span> | <span class="t">that's like asking what is consciousness. Is a spectrum. The agenticity, and that's a word now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=139" target="_blank">00:02:19.540</a></span> | <span class="t">agenticity, of an agent is a spectrum. So there are different levels. I came here and I saw Waymo,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.540</a></span> | <span class="t">and to me it was pure sorcery. We don't have that in the UK. And there are different levels of self-driving,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=155" target="_blank">00:02:35.380</a></span> | <span class="t">so you can look at the agentic spectrum in that respect. We have a minimal agent, where there's an LLM</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.660</a></span> | <span class="t">run in the loop. Great. Then you have a level four is autonomous agent. A bunch of agents that have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.060</a></span> | <span class="t">access to tools. They can do whatever they want. They're not prompted in any way or a minimal way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.820</a></span> | <span class="t">But this is how I see things. It's a spectrum. So what is an AI agent? It's a computation entity</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.420</a></span> | <span class="t">with awareness of its environment through perception, cognitive abilities through an LLM, and also can take</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.540</a></span> | <span class="t">action through tool use. But the most important bit is there is some form of memory, short term or long term.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Memory is important. It's important because we're trying to make our agents reflective, interactive,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.580</a></span> | <span class="t">proactive, and reactive, and autonomous. And most of this, if not all, can be solved with memory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.420</a></span> | <span class="t">I work at MongoDB, and we're going to connect the dots. Don't worry. So this is all nice and good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.980</a></span> | <span class="t">This is what you look at if you double-click into one AI agent is. But the most important bit to me...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll go slide. People are taking pictures. Sorry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.220</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. Let's go. The most important bit is memory. And when we talk about memory,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.300</a></span> | <span class="t">the easy way you can think about it is short-term, long-term. But there are other distinct forms,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.100</a></span> | <span class="t">right? Conversational, entity memory, knowledge, data store, cache, working memory. We're going to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.940</a></span> | <span class="t">talking about all of that today. So these are the high-level concepts. But let me go a little bit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.060</a></span> | <span class="t">metal. Why we're all here today in this conference. It's because of AI, right? We're all architects of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.940</a></span> | <span class="t">intelligence. The whole point of AI is to build some form of computational entity that surpasses</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.660</a></span> | <span class="t">human intelligence or mimics it. Then AGI, we're focused on making that intelligence surpass humans</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.900</a></span> | <span class="t">in all tasks we can think of. And if you think about the most intelligent humans you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.980</a></span> | <span class="t">what determines the intelligence is their ability to recall. It's their memory. So if AI or AGI is meant</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.580</a></span> | <span class="t">to mimic human intelligence, it's a no-brainer, no pun intended, that we need memory within the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.980</a></span> | <span class="t">agents that we're building today. Does anyone disagree? Good. I would have kicked you out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, let's go. So humans, in your brain right now, you have this. This is not what it looks like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=302" target="_blank">00:05:02.180</a></span> | <span class="t">but it's close enough. You have different forms of memory. And that's what makes you intelligent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.740</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what makes you retain some of the information I'm going to be giving you today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.500</a></span> | <span class="t">There is short-term, long-term, working memory, semantic, episodic, procedural memory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.060</a></span> | <span class="t">In your brain right now, there is something called a cerebellum. I always get the word wrong,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.340</a></span> | <span class="t">but that's where you store most of the routines and skills you can do. Can anyone hear your backflip?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Really? Wow. You can see my excitement. The information or the knowledge of that backflip is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.460</a></span> | <span class="t">actually stored in that part of your brain. So I heard it's 90% confidence, by the way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.100</a></span> | <span class="t">It is, right? I'm not going to do one. But it's stored in that part of your brain. Now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=347" target="_blank">00:05:47.940</a></span> | <span class="t">you can actually mimic this in agents. I'm going to show you how. But now we're talking about agent memory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=356" target="_blank">00:05:56.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Agent memory is the mechanisms that we are implementing to actually make sure that states persist in our AI application.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Our agents are able to accumulate information, turn data into memory, and have it inform the next</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=374" target="_blank">00:06:14.340</a></span> | <span class="t">execution step.

And the core topic that we are going to be working on as AI memory</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.500</a></span> | <span class="t">engineers is on memory management. We are going to be building memory management systems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=396" target="_blank">00:06:36.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And memory management is a systematic process of organizing all the information that you're putting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=402" target="_blank">00:06:42.260</a></span> | <span class="t">into the context window. Yes, we have like large context window, but that's not for you to stuff</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=407" target="_blank">00:06:47.540</a></span> | <span class="t">all your data in. That's for you to pull in the relevant memory and structure them in a way that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=413" target="_blank">00:06:53.300</a></span> | <span class="t">is effective, that allows for the response to be relevant. So these are the core components of memory</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=420" target="_blank">00:07:00.820</a></span> | <span class="t">management: generation, storage, retrieval integration, updating, deletion. There's a lie here, because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=427" target="_blank">00:07:07.380</a></span> | <span class="t">you don't delete memories. Humans don't delete their memories, except it's a traumatic one that you want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=432" target="_blank">00:07:12.980</a></span> | <span class="t">forget. But we really should be looking at implementing forgetting mechanisms within the memory management</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=440" target="_blank">00:07:20.100</a></span> | <span class="t">systems that we're building. You don't want to delete memories. And there are different research</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=443" target="_blank">00:07:23.700</a></span> | <span class="t">papers that are looking at how to implement some form of forgetting within agents. But the most important</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=450" target="_blank">00:07:30.260</a></span> | <span class="t">bit is retrieval. And I'm getting to the MongoDB part. Moving around, this is RAG. It's very simple,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=460" target="_blank">00:07:40.260</a></span> | <span class="t">right? Because we've been doing it as AI engineers. MongoDB is that one database that is called to RAG</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=469" target="_blank">00:07:49.060</a></span> | <span class="t">pipelines, because it gives you all the retrieval mechanisms. RAG is not just vector. Vector search</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=473" target="_blank">00:07:53.860</a></span> | <span class="t">is not all you need. You need other type of search. And we have that with MongoDB, anything you can think of.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=479" target="_blank">00:07:59.380</a></span> | <span class="t">You're going to be hearing a lot about MongoDB in this conference today. But this is what RAG is. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=485" target="_blank">00:08:05.940</a></span> | <span class="t">you level up, you go into the world of agentic RAG, right?

So this is Persona. I have a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=625" target="_blank">00:10:25.780</a></span> | <span class="t">demo if we have time.

The document data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2HVdB4Jbjs&t=679" target="_blank">00:11:19.140</a></span> | <span class="t">model is very flexible.

An example of it anyway. So we have episodic memory. We have long-term memory.
