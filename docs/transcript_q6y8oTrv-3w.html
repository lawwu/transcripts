And in the end, the line between what happened at Enron and, and, and what happened in the global financial crisis, it's not a matter of black and white.</p><p>It's not a matter of one thing was clear cut fraud and one thing. Great. We love these practices. Isn't this fantastic? This is the way we want business to operate. They're both somewhere in the murky middle. You know, a lot of what happened at Enron wasn't actually outright fraud.</p><p>I coined this phrase legal fraud to describe, um, to describe what it is that, that, that, that happened at Enron. And a lot of what happened in the global financial crisis was legal, hence the lack of prosecutions. But it's also not behavior that, that leads to a healthy market or for that matter, a healthy society.</p></div></div></body></html>
