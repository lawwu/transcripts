This is a very new feature that has been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=6" target="_blank">00:00:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">released by OpenAI and it gives us the ability to fine-tune our own custom GPT 3.5 models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=14" target="_blank">00:00:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So we can feed it a ton of our own conversations that are the ideal conversations we would like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=22" target="_blank">00:00:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">our chatbot or conversational agent to have and with those OpenAI will fine-tune a GPT 3.5 model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=31" target="_blank">00:00:31.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and give that back to us as a sort of custom model that we can then just retrieve from the API</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=39" target="_blank">00:00:39.040</a></span> | <span class="t">given a... we'll basically get like a unique ID for each model. So that's really cool because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=46" target="_blank">00:00:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">with these models, I mean there's a few things that we can do to improve them. We can do a ton</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=53" target="_blank">00:00:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">of prompt engineering. It takes a long time but usually doesn't get us all the way there. We can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=58" target="_blank">00:00:58.720</a></span> | <span class="t">also do retrieval augmentation. Again it helps in some cases but not in others and if we add</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=64" target="_blank">00:01:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">fine-tuning into that mix we actually have a lot of what we need in order to get almost any type of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=72" target="_blank">00:01:12.720</a></span> | <span class="t">behavior that we'd like from our chatbots. So this is a very important feature and one that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=80" target="_blank">00:01:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is going to become a key part of anyone's toolkit who is developing AI applications.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=85" target="_blank">00:01:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So a big part of fine-tuning is always data preparation and collection. We're going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">touch on that in this video but I'm actually going to leave the majority of that for another video</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">although it is very interesting so I definitely want to go into details of how I'm building these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=100" target="_blank">00:01:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">datasets. But for now we'll just jump straight into the fine-tuning component. Okay so we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.920</a></span> | <span class="t">going to get started with this notebook here. We have a few installs here. We go ahead install those.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=114" target="_blank">00:01:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">We're going to get our dataset. So again this is one that I've pre-built. I will say there wasn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">much manual work in this. It's kind of all automated to build it. Essentially you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of see what we have here. These are all actually different but the system message for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">each one of these is the same but then you have like essentially like a conversation or a small</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">segment of a conversation down here. All of these are generated by GPT-4 so we can almost think of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">this fine-tuning as a form of knowledge distillation which is where you would use one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">model's knowledge and distill that knowledge into another model through some sort of fine-tuning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">approach which is what we're doing here. Now you can see example one the records here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">We have the role system. This is the template system prompt from LangChain. We have this role</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">user and then we have you can see we have tools in here right. So that's the bit that is the most</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">important because what I want to do here is actually fine-tune chat or GPT-3.5 to be a better</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">agent and the issue that I have with GPT-3.5 as an agent is that it really struggles to use this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">JSON format. So you can kind of see it here. It just seems to struggle with it a lot. GPT-4 does</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">very well and that's why I've used GPT-4 to generate this data set. GPT-3.5 not so much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So we've created this data set in order to essentially teach it how to better use that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">format. Okay now this is just focusing on almost like a retrieval tool only. Naturally in a real</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">use case we would want more diverse conversations not just using a single tool. We'd want multiple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">tools and we'd also want conversations that are not necessarily always using tools but for this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">example I think this is good enough. So I'm just going to save this to a local JSON lines file. We</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">can see over here we can open this and all we will see is this. So we have our messages. So this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the format we need to follow when we're training. So we have a like a dictionary of messages and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">then we have a list of multiple messages that we're going to be training on. Each one of these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">represents a single conversation. Okay we can go across like I said the first system message is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">same for all of them. Again that's maybe something you'd want to modify or maybe you just use your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">particular format that you're using for a chatbot that you'd like to train. So here we have next</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">message role users. We have the tools that the assistant can use. Okay see these are all going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to be the same again and then we get to here and this is where things begin to change. So here we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">have the end of the user message which is where we have a question from the user. That is followed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=316" target="_blank">00:05:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">by the assistant responding with I want to use a vector search tool and it uses this JSON format</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that we've set up. And what we have here is like a search query. Okay main focus of technical report.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">This technical report and you see this is kind of coming from this. Right all of this is generated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=338" target="_blank">00:05:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">by gpt4. So we said okay this is a question based on some information that we have from a data set.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Make a search query which is what we have there and then continue and we get the context and we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=355" target="_blank">00:05:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">get later on an answer as well near the end. Okay here assistant JSON action final answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Focus of the technical report so on and so on is this. Right that's our format. So then we want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=370" target="_blank">00:06:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">go on to here where we are going to first upload the files that we're going to be using for fine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=377" target="_blank">00:06:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">tuning. So that's our conversation JSON lines file. We're going to be using this OpenAI file</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">create which is obviously a new method in the OpenAI client. So you do need to make sure you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=391" target="_blank">00:06:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">have updated the client. The version I'm using here is 0279. Okay cool from that you we run this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and we'll get a file id. We need to take that so we get it from here. Get the file id and we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">going to use it to create a fine tuning job. Okay so this is the actual like the fine tuning of our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=417" target="_blank">00:06:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">model and we specify what model we would like to fine tune. At the moment this is our only option.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=424" target="_blank">00:07:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So we run that. We should also sometimes it can take a little bit of time for this file to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=433" target="_blank">00:07:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">available but you'll see if you if it pops up with an error here that means it just isn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=439" target="_blank">00:07:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">available yet. So you just need to wait a little bit. It doesn't take too long though. Okay so now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=445" target="_blank">00:07:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">we can see we we have this fine tuning job running and it says finish at null. That's because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=453" target="_blank">00:07:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">obviously it takes a little bit of time for the model to be fine tuned. So we essentially need to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=460" target="_blank">00:07:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">just wait until this is not null anymore and once that is not null we will also get our fine tuned</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=468" target="_blank">00:07:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">model id which we'll need to use later on. So we can yeah we'll get the job id where is that it is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=478" target="_blank">00:07:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">here and using that job id we can just retrieve the information for our fine tuning job like so.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=486" target="_blank">00:08:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay so you see it still hasn't finished and it won't actually finish for a while. You can also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=494" target="_blank">00:08:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">check this so this will just say hey look created fine tuning job and then fine tuning job actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=502" target="_blank">00:08:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">started. Okay and yeah there the events what you can do is you can kind of set this so this will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">just keep looping through and every 100 seconds it's going to call the API and check if the fine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=516" target="_blank">00:08:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">tuning job has finished. You can either do that or you can check your emails. So OpenAI once your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=523" target="_blank">00:08:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">fine tuning job has finished will also send you an email. Okay so this does take a little bit of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=529" target="_blank">00:08:49.760</a></span> | <span class="t">time. I don't I think it was at least sort of 10-20 minutes when I ran it so probably more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=537" target="_blank">00:08:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">along 20 or so minutes. So what I'm going to do is just pause this or stop this and I am just going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=545" target="_blank">00:09:05.040</a></span> | <span class="t">to come to here which is the model that I fine-tuned before this video. So this one is already</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=553" target="_blank">00:09:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">ready and I can just I'm just going to go ahead and use this rather than waiting. Now okay once</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=559" target="_blank">00:09:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">we have our fine-tuned model we'll get our you know we get the id from here which is what I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=564" target="_blank">00:09:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">mentioned before and then we're going to I'm just going to test this. Okay so I'm actually going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=571" target="_blank">00:09:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">use this fine-tuned model in a conversational agent through LineChain. So to do so yeah we need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=579" target="_blank">00:09:39.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the fine-tuned model id. I'm going to use a like a retrieval chain. The retrieval chain in LineChain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=589" target="_blank">00:09:49.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I find is a little bit slow and overly complicated so I'm going to just load my own custom chain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=597" target="_blank">00:09:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">from here like retrieval chain. Retrieval tool is what we'll be using it as and essentially</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=604" target="_blank">00:10:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">it just makes less LLM calls so retrieval will be faster. Okay and from there we just want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=613" target="_blank">00:10:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">load our or create our conversational agent as we typically would. So we have a LLM here we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=622" target="_blank">00:10:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">just using our fine-tuned model name. We yeah we're using conversational buffer window memory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=629" target="_blank">00:10:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">We have this vector db chain which is going to be our tool which we initialize here. So this tool</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=637" target="_blank">00:10:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">is using Pinecone so if you're following along you can just get your environment and your API</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=643" target="_blank">00:10:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">key from here. Okay cool so once we have initialized all of those we can come down to here which is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=652" target="_blank">00:10:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">initializing our agent. Conversational right description so conversational agent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=657" target="_blank">00:10:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and we just run that. Cool now we can say okay tell me about LLAMA2 and I actually I should</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=666" target="_blank">00:11:06.240</a></span> | <span class="t">just point out that in order to use this tool here you would need to index your data first.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=673" target="_blank">00:11:13.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So I have another notebook for that I'll leave a link to that at the top of the video so you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=678" target="_blank">00:11:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">run through that if you if you really want to go through the whole thing. So okay let's go with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=684" target="_blank">00:11:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">tell me about LLAMA2 it's just going to give us an answer but what we want to see is that it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=688" target="_blank">00:11:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">correctly using this JSON format which it is doing which is really cool. So yeah we see it for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=697" target="_blank">00:11:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">vector search tool action it did that I'm printing out more than I need to here I'm printing out the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=704" target="_blank">00:11:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">vector because I was debugging earlier. We have a second like JSON or agent action which is to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=714" target="_blank">00:11:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">provide the final answer to the user and it is LLAMA2 is a collection of pre-trained fine-tuned</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=719" target="_blank">00:11:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">large language models so on and so on right. Okay cool so that is one question let's try another.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=729" target="_blank">00:12:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">What makes LLAMA2 so special? I think this is pulling from like the same context but we can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=738" target="_blank">00:12:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">come up to here again I'm printing out too much but it's fine. So LLAMA2 is special because it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=747" target="_blank">00:12:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">features a collection of pre-trained and fine-tuned large language models,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=751" target="_blank">00:12:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">optimizer dialog, use cases, these models called so on and so on. I think we're supposed to say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=757" target="_blank">00:12:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">LLAMA outperform open source chat models on most benchmarks tested and maybe substitute for closed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=764" target="_blank">00:12:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">source models. Okay looks good now tell me about LLAMA2 red teaming. Again what we're looking for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=773" target="_blank">00:12:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">is the correct JSON format which it handles nicely and yeah we get I think it's the same</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=782" target="_blank">00:13:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">same good answer again right. So all looks good everything's in the format that we would want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=788" target="_blank">00:13:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and yeah that is how we would fine-tune a GPT 3.5 model on our own dataset. Again like I said a big</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=798" target="_blank">00:13:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">part of this is actually building the dataset this is just a very quick sort of demo example</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=805" target="_blank">00:13:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">on how to do this. So what I want to do going forwards is put together a more a longer video</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=811" target="_blank">00:13:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">on fine-tuning where we'll kind of dive into actually building the dataset which is honestly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=817" target="_blank">00:13:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the more important part of all of this but at least we've seen the different endpoints for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=824" target="_blank">00:13:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the OpenAI client that we need to use when we're fine-tuning. So for now I'll leave it there I hope</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=831" target="_blank">00:13:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">this has been helpful and interesting so thank you very much for watching and I will see you again</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boHXgQ5eQic&t=836" target="_blank">00:13:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">in the next one.
