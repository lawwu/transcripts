And how did you convince Microsoft to purchase GitHub?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=9" target="_blank">00:00:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, so I had started a company called Xamarin together with Miguel de Caza and Joseph Hill,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=14" target="_blank">00:00:14.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and we had built kind of mobile tools and platforms. And Microsoft acquired the company in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=20" target="_blank">00:00:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">2016. And I was excited about that. I thought it was great. But to be honest, I didn't actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=26" target="_blank">00:00:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">expect or plan to spend, you know, more than a kind of a year or so there. But when I got in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=32" target="_blank">00:00:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">there, I got exposed to what Satya was doing and just the quality of his leadership team. I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=37" target="_blank">00:00:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">really impressed. And actually, I think I saw him in the first week or so I was there and he asked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=44" target="_blank">00:00:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">me, "What do you think we should do at Microsoft?" And I said, "I think we should buy GitHub."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=47" target="_blank">00:00:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">When would this have been?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=49" target="_blank">00:00:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">This was like my first week. It was like March or April of 2016.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=53" target="_blank">00:00:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=54" target="_blank">00:00:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And then he said, "Yeah, it's a good idea. We thought about it. I'm not sure we can get away</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=61" target="_blank">00:01:01.040</a></span> | <span class="t">with it," or something like that. And then it was about a year later, a little more than a year</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=65" target="_blank">00:01:05.040</a></span> | <span class="t">later, yeah, I wrote him an email, just a memo. You know, I sort of said like, "I think it's time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=70" target="_blank">00:01:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to do this." There was some noise that Google was sniffing around. I think that may have been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=75" target="_blank">00:01:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">manufactured by the GitHub team. But it was a good catalyst because it was something I thought made</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.520</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of sense for Microsoft to do anyway. And so I wrote an email to Satya, sort of a little memo</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">saying, "Hey, I think we should buy GitHub. Here's why. Here's what we should do with it."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=87" target="_blank">00:01:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And the basic argument was developers are making IT purchasing decisions now. It used to be this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of IT thing, and now developers are leading that purchase. And it's this sort of major shift</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=102" target="_blank">00:01:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">in how software products are acquired. And Microsoft really was an IT company. It was not a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=109" target="_blank">00:01:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">developer company in the way most of its purchases were made, but it was founded as a developer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">company, right? And so Microsoft's first product was a programming language. Yeah, I said, "Look,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">the challenge that we have is there's an entire new generation of developers who have no affinity</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">with Microsoft. And the largest collection of them is at GitHub. And if we acquire this and we do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">a merely competent job of running it, we can earn the right to be considered by these developers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">for all the other products that we do." And to my surprise, Satya replied in like six or seven</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">minutes and said, "I think this is very good thinking. Let's meet next week or so and talk</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">about it." And I ended up at this conference room with him and Amy Hood and Scott Guthrie and Kevin</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Scott and several other people. And they said, "Okay, tell us what you're thinking." And I kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">of did a little 20-minute ramble on it. And Satya said, "Yeah, I think we should do it. And why don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">we run it independently like LinkedIn? Nat, you'll be the CEO." And he said, "Do you think we can get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">it for two billion?" And I said, "We could try." And three weeks later, he said, "Okay, go do this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Scott. Scott will support you on this." Three weeks later, we had a signed term sheet and an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">announced deal. And then it was an amazing experience for me. I'd been there less than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.600</a></span> | <span class="t">two years. And Microsoft was made up of and run by a lot of people who'd been there for many years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And they trusted me with this really big project and made me feel really good to be trusted and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">empowered. And I had grown up in the open source world. And so for me to get an opportunity to run</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">GitHub, it's like, I don't know, getting appointed mayor of your hometown or something like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">It felt cool. And I really wanted to do a good job for developers. And so that's how it happened.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">That's actually one of the things I want to ask you about. Because often when something succeeds,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">we kind of think it was inevitable that it would succeed. But at the time, I remember,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, it was a while back, but I remember that there was a huge amount of skepticism. I would go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">on Hacker News and the top thing would be a blog post about how Microsoft's going to mess up GitHub.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And I guess those concerns have been alleviated throughout the years. But how did you deal with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">that skepticism and deal with that distrust? Well, I was really paranoid about it. And I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">really cared about what developers thought. I think there's always this question of who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">are you performing for? Who do you actually really care about? Who's the audience that's in your head</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that you're trying to do a good job for, impress, earn the respect of, whatever it is. And though I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">love Microsoft and care a lot about Satya and everyone there, I really cared about the developers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I'd grown up in this open source world. And so for me to do a bad job with this central institution</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and open source would have been a devastating feeling for me. It was very important to me not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">to. So that was sort of the first thing is just that I cared. And then the second thing is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the deal leaked. It was going to be announced, I think, on a Monday. It leaked on a Friday.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And Microsoft's buying GitHub. And the whole weekend, there were terrible posts online,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">people saying, we've got to evacuate GitHub as quickly as possible. And we're like, oh my god,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that's terrible. And then Monday, we put the announcement out. And we said, we're acquiring</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">GitHub. It's going to run as an independent company. And then it said, Nat Friedman's going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">to be CEO. And I had-- I don't want to overstate or whatever. But I think a couple people were like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">oh, Nat comes from open source. He spent some time in open source. And it's going to be run</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">independently. So I don't think they were really that calmed down. But at least a few people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=316" target="_blank">00:05:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">thought, oh, maybe I'll give this a few months and just see what happens before I migrate off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And then my first day as CEO after we got the deal closed, 9 AM the first day, I was in this room.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And we got on Zoom and all the heads of engineering and product. And I think maybe-- I don't know what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">people were expecting. But I think maybe they were expecting some kind of longer-term strategy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">or something. But I came in. And I said, there was this GitHub had no official feedback mechanism</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">that was publicly available. But there was several GitHub repos that community members had started.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Isaac from NPM had started one where he'd just been allowing people to give GitHub feedback.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=357" target="_blank">00:05:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And people had been voting on this stuff for years. And I shared my screen and put that up,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">sorted by votes, and said, we're going to pick one thing from this list and fix it by the end</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">of the day and ship that, just one thing. And I think people were like, this is the new CEO</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=374" target="_blank">00:06:14.720</a></span> | <span class="t">strategy. And they were like, I don't know. You have to do database migrations. You can't do that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">in a day. And then someone's like, well, maybe we can do this. We actually have a half implementation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=386" target="_blank">00:06:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">of this. And we eventually found something that we could fix by the end of the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=391" target="_blank">00:06:31.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And what I'm thinking is-- what I'm thinking, what I hope I said was, what we need to show</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=396" target="_blank">00:06:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the world is that GitHub cares about developers, not that it cares about Microsoft. If the first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=402" target="_blank">00:06:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">thing we did after the acquisition was to add Skype integration, developers would have said, oh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=408" target="_blank">00:06:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">we're not your priority. You have new priorities now. And so the idea was just to find ways to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=414" target="_blank">00:06:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">make it better for the people who use it and have them see that we cared about that immediately.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=420" target="_blank">00:07:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I said, we're going to do this today. And then we're going to do it every day for the next</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">100 days. And it was cool, because I think it created some really good feedback loops,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=429" target="_blank">00:07:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">at least for me. One was, you ship things. And then people are like, oh, hey, I've been wanting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=433" target="_blank">00:07:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">to see this fixed for years. And now it's fixed. It's a relatively simple thing. So you get this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=438" target="_blank">00:07:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of nice dopaminergic feedback loop going there. And then people in the team feel the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=444" target="_blank">00:07:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">excitement of shipping stuff. I think GitHub was a company that had a little bit of stage</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=450" target="_blank">00:07:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">fright about shipping previously. And so to break that static friction and ship a little bit more,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=455" target="_blank">00:07:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I think felt good. And then the other one is just the learning loop. By trying to do lots</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=459" target="_blank">00:07:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">of small things, I got exposed to like, OK, this team is really good. Or this part of the code has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=466" target="_blank">00:07:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of tech debt. Or hey, we shipped that, and it was actually kind of bad. How come that design</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=471" target="_blank">00:07:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">got out? Whereas if the project had been some six-month thing, I'm not sure my learning would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=478" target="_blank">00:07:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">have been quite as quick about the company. And there's still things I missed and mistakes I made,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=482" target="_blank">00:08:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">for sure. But that was part of how I think-- no one knows counterfactually whether that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwbXiITmxTU&t=489" target="_blank">00:08:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">made a big difference or not. But I do think that earned some trust.</span></div></div></body></html>
