It captured the Colosseum in El Jem</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AsFAqZdBPU&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.180</a></span> | <span class="t">blue elephant.

Not all of them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AsFAqZdBPU&t=155" target="_blank">00:02:35.460</a></span> | <span class="t">are on the trunk and you're not getting much of a sense of location. Then of course I wanted to test</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AsFAqZdBPU&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Reeve which was codenamed Half Moon previously which is claimed by that company to be the best image model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AsFAqZdBPU&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">in the world and the way I'd phrase it is that it's very very good.

On this particular prompt</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AsFAqZdBPU&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">you may even prefer it even though there are only four trees that I can see but it's a really good image</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AsFAqZdBPU&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and great sense of location.

I asked all the models to illustrate the idiom hold your horses.

Only OpenAI's 4.0 image gen understood the metaphor and in every image conveyed it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AsFAqZdBPU&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.740</a></span> | <span class="t">appropriately.
