And now, my conversation with Dr. Aaliyah Crum. Well, great to have you here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=21" target="_blank">00:00:21.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Great to be here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=23" target="_blank">00:00:23.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Just to start off, you know, you've talked a lot and worked a lot on the science of mindsets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=29" target="_blank">00:00:29.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Could you define for us what is a mindset and what sort of purpose does it serve?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=34" target="_blank">00:00:34.520</a></span> | <span class="t">We define mindsets as core beliefs or assumptions that we have about a domain or category of things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=42" target="_blank">00:00:42.920</a></span> | <span class="t">that orient us to a particular set of expectations, explanations, and goals. I can distill it down</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=52" target="_blank">00:00:52.300</a></span> | <span class="t">for you. So mindsets are an assumption that you make about a domain. So take stress, for example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=58" target="_blank">00:00:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">stress. What's your sort of core belief about that? Do you view stress as enhancing, good for you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=64" target="_blank">00:01:04.860</a></span> | <span class="t">or do you view it as debilitating and bad for you? Those mindsets, those core beliefs, orient our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=71" target="_blank">00:01:11.240</a></span> | <span class="t">thinking. They change what we expect will happen to us when we're stressed, how we explain the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=77" target="_blank">00:01:17.020</a></span> | <span class="t">occurrences that happen or unfold when we're stressed, and also change our motivation for what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=83" target="_blank">00:01:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">we engage in when we're stressed. Sort of distilling down those core assumptions that really shape and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=88" target="_blank">00:01:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">orient our thinking and action.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=90" target="_blank">00:01:30.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I've heard you say before that mindsets simplify life in some way by constraining the number of things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.660</a></span> | <span class="t">that we have to consider. And it sounds to me like we can have mindsets about many things. As you said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=101" target="_blank">00:01:41.980</a></span> | <span class="t">many people are familiar with our colleague Carol Dweck's notion of growth mindset, that if we're not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">proficient at something that we should think about not being proficient yet, that we are on some path to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">proficiency. But what are some examples of mindsets? And how early do these get laid down? Or do we learn them from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">our parents? Yeah, sure. So I think it's important with Carol Dweck's work, a lot of people kind of get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.940</a></span> | <span class="t">focused on growth motivation and all these things. But her work really originated from thinking about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.840</a></span> | <span class="t">what she called those implicit theories or core beliefs about the nature of intelligence or ability.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=139" target="_blank">00:02:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. So do you believe that your baseline levels of intelligence are fixed, static, set throughout the rest of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.980</a></span> | <span class="t">your life? Or do you believe that they can grow and change? And the reality is, as it always is complex, and it's a bit of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=155" target="_blank">00:02:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">both, and it's all these things. But as humans, we need these simplifying systems to help us understand a complex</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">reality. But they're not inconsequential, right? They matter in shaping our motivation. And as she has shown, if you have the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.340</a></span> | <span class="t">mindset that intelligence is malleable, you're motivated to work harder to grow your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.260</a></span> | <span class="t">intelligence. If you have the mindset that it's fixed, why work harder at math if you don't think you're good at it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.700</a></span> | <span class="t">What our work has aimed to do is to expand the range of mindsets that we are studying, focused on, and also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.080</a></span> | <span class="t">understand and expand the range of effects that they have. So I mentioned, you know, mindsets about stress.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.980</a></span> | <span class="t">We've also looked at mindsets about food and healthy eating. So do you have the mindset that foods that are good for you, healthy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.540</a></span> | <span class="t">foods are disgusting and depriving? Or do you have the mindset that healthy foods are indulgent and delicious?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Generally, people, at least in our culture in the West, have this view that stress is debilitating, healthy foods are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.160</a></span> | <span class="t">disgusting and depriving. And those mindsets, whether or not they're true or false, right or wrong, they have an impact.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And they have an impact not just through the motivational mechanisms that Dweck and others have studied, but as our lab has started to reveal, they also shape physiological mechanisms by changing what our bodies prioritize and prepare to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.220</a></span> | <span class="t">We've looked at mindsets about exercise. Do you feel like you're getting enough? Or do you feel like you're getting an insufficient amount to get the health benefits you're seeking?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Mindsets about illness? Do you view cancer as an unmitigated catastrophe? Or do you view cancer as manageable?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.920</a></span> | <span class="t">We've looked at mindsets about symptoms and side effects. Do you view side effects as, you know, a sign that the treatment is harmful? Or do you view side effects as a sign that the treatment is working?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, these are sort of core beliefs or assumptions you have about these domains or categories, but they matter because they're shaping, they're synthesizing and simplifying the way we're thinking, but they're also shaping what we're paying attention to, what we're motivated to do, and potentially even how our bodies respond.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I'd love to talk about this notion of mindset shaping, how our bodies respond. And maybe as an example of this, if you could share with us this now famous study that you've done with a milkshake study.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Certainly, yeah, this was a study that I ran as a graduate student at Yale University. I was working with Kelly Brownell and Peter Salovey. Peter Salovey had done a lot of work on really coining the term emotional intelligence, studying that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">He's now the president of Yale, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">He's now the president of Yale, yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So he's done well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">He's done well for himself and for the university and society.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=329" target="_blank">00:05:29.700</a></span> | <span class="t">I had come in doing some previous work on mindsets about exercise and placebo effects and exercise, and it really occurred to me that there was a very simple question that hadn't been probed yet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And that was, do our beliefs about what we're eating change our body's physiological response to that food, holding constant the objective nutrients of that thing?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So that question might sound outrageous at first, but it was, it's really not outrageous if you're coming from a place of having studied in depth placebo effects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=364" target="_blank">00:06:04.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So placebo effects are this robust demonstration in which simply taking a sugar pill, taking nothing, under the impression that it's a real medication that might relieve your asthma, reduce your blood pressure, boost your immune system, can lead to those physiological effects,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=383" target="_blank">00:06:23.880</a></span> | <span class="t">even though there's no objective nutrients.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=386" target="_blank">00:06:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we have more evidence on placebo effects than we have for any other drug because of, because of the clinical trial process in which all new drugs and medication are, medications are required to outperform a placebo effect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=400" target="_blank">00:06:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have a lot of data on the placebo effect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=402" target="_blank">00:06:42.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But anyways, going back to this question, it was like, all right, we've moved from, you know, medications solving our health crises to behavioral medicine solving our health crises.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=413" target="_blank">00:06:53.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Increase people's exercise, increase people's exercise, get them to eat better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=416" target="_blank">00:06:56.460</a></span> | <span class="t">To what degree are these things influenced by our mindsets or beliefs about them?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=421" target="_blank">00:07:01.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So to test this question, we ran a seemingly simple study.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=426" target="_blank">00:07:06.860</a></span> | <span class="t">This was done at the Yale Center for Clinical and Translational Research.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=431" target="_blank">00:07:11.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And we brought people into our lab under the impression that we were designing different milkshakes with vastly different metabolic concentrations, nutrient concentrations, that were designed to meet different metabolic needs of the patrons of the hospital, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=448" target="_blank">00:07:28.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So you're going to come in, you're going to taste these milkshakes, and we're going to measure your body's physiological response to them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=454" target="_blank">00:07:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">This was a within-subjects design, so it was the same people consuming two different milkshakes, two different time points separated by a week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=464" target="_blank">00:07:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And at one time point, they were told that they were consuming this really high-fat, high-caloric, indulgent milkshake.</span></div><div

sugar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=475" target="_blank">00:07:55.800</a></span> | <span class="t">At the other time point, they were told that it was a low-fat, low-calorie, sensible sort of diet shake.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=482" target="_blank">00:08:02.540</a></span> | <span class="t">In reality, it was the exact same shake.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=484" target="_blank">00:08:04.580</a></span> | <span class="t">It was right in the middle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=485" target="_blank">00:08:05.560</a></span> | <span class="t">It was like 300 calories, moderate amount of fats and sugars.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=489" target="_blank">00:08:09.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And we were measuring their body's gut peptide response to this shake.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=493" target="_blank">00:08:13.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And in particular, we were looking at the hormone ghrelin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=496" target="_blank">00:08:16.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Medical experts call it the hunger hormone, rises in ghrelin, signal, you know, seek out food.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=503" target="_blank">00:08:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then theoretically, in proportion to the amount of calories you consume, ghrelin levels drop, signaling to the brain,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=510" target="_blank">00:08:30.660</a></span> | <span class="t">okay, you don't need to eat so much anymore, you can stop eating, and also revving up the metabolism to burn the nutrients that were just ingested.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=518" target="_blank">00:08:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">What we found in this study was that when people thought they were consuming the high-fat, high-calorie, indulgent milkshake,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=526" target="_blank">00:08:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">their ghrelin levels dropped at a three-fold rate, stronger than when they thought they were consuming the sensible shake.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=534" target="_blank">00:08:54.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So essentially, their bodies responded as if they had consumed more food, even though it was the exact same shake at both time points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=544" target="_blank">00:09:04.440</a></span> | <span class="t">It was, to my knowledge, one of the first studies to show any effects of just believing that you're eating something different on your physiology.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=552" target="_blank">00:09:12.260</a></span> | <span class="t">The second piece was really important as well, and especially for me, this was one study that really transformed the way I think about how I approach eating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=561" target="_blank">00:09:21.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And that was the manner in which it affected our physiology was somewhat counterintuitive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=569" target="_blank">00:09:29.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So I had gone in thinking, the better mindset to be in when you eat is that you're eating healthy, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=575" target="_blank">00:09:35.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, you know, it just makes sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=576" target="_blank">00:09:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, placebo effects, think you're healthy, you'll be healthy, you know?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=579" target="_blank">00:09:39.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But that was a far too simplistic way of thinking about it, and in fact, it was the exact opposite.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=585" target="_blank">00:09:45.220</a></span> | <span class="t">When these participants thought they were eating sensibly, their bodies left them still feeling physiologically hungry, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=593" target="_blank">00:09:53.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Not satiated, which could potentially be corresponding to slower metabolism and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=600" target="_blank">00:10:00.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're in the interest of maintaining or losing weight, what's the best mindset to be in?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=606" target="_blank">00:10:06.100</a></span> | <span class="t">It's to be in a mindset that you're eating indulgently, that you're having enough food, that you're getting enough.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=611" target="_blank">00:10:11.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And at least in that study, we showed that has a more adaptive effect on ghrelin responses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=617" target="_blank">00:10:17.720</a></span> | <span class="t">It's really remarkable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=619" target="_blank">00:10:19.100</a></span> | <span class="t">It raises a question that I just have to ask.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=622" target="_blank">00:10:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">You've got people who are strictly plant-based.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=626" target="_blank">00:10:26.580</a></span> | <span class="t">You've got people who are omnivores, you've got people who are carnivores, you have every variation, you have intermittent fasting, also called time-restricted feeding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=634" target="_blank">00:10:34.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And it seems like once a group kind of plugs into a particular mode of eating that they feel works for them, for whatever reason, energy-wise, mentally, maybe they're looking at their blood profiles, maybe they're not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=646" target="_blank">00:10:46.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Each camp seems to count on the health benefits and how great they feel, could it be that mindset effects are involved there?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=654" target="_blank">00:10:54.420</a></span> | <span class="t">It does matter what it is, and it matters what you think about that diet and what others around you and in our culture think about that diet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=665" target="_blank">00:11:05.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Because those social contexts inform our mindsets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=669" target="_blank">00:11:09.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Our mindsets interact with our physiology in ways that produce outcomes that are really important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=676" target="_blank">00:11:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's not get dualistic and say, you know, it's either all in the mind or not in the mind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=682" target="_blank">00:11:22.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's also not be unnecessarily combative and say, oh, it should be all plant-based or, you know, keto or whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=689" target="_blank">00:11:29.100</a></span> | <span class="t">It's all of those things are a combined product of what you're actually doing and what you're thinking about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=696" target="_blank">00:11:36.280</a></span> | <span class="t">If you believe in it, if you don't, if you're skeptical or, you know, in some cases you think you should be eating a certain way and then you don't live up to that, it might have an adverse effect because of the stress and the anxiety associated with that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=711" target="_blank">00:11:51.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, there was a paper a year or two ago published in Science Magazine about brain regions involved in psychogenic fever that if people or you can actually do this in animal models too, think that they are sick, you get a genuine one to three degree increase in body temperature, one to three degrees Fahrenheit increase in body temperature, which is pretty impressive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=732" target="_blank">00:12:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=732" target="_blank">00:12:12.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And I guess it plays into, you know, symptomology generally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=736" target="_blank">00:12:16.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm a believer in belief effects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=738" target="_blank">00:12:18.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, it's also, and I would just say that, you know, the term that we use in our field is nocebo effect for that, which is sort of the placebo's ugly stepsister, you know, it's when negative beliefs cause negative consequences.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=753" target="_blank">00:12:33.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So you are told you will have, you know, it's, it's very well demonstrated that when people are told about certain side effects, they're far more likely to experience those side effects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=765" target="_blank">00:12:45.700</a></span> | <span class="t">I'd love for you to tell us about, um, the hotel workers study.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=770" target="_blank">00:12:50.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, no, I think that this is a really good example of this phenomenon, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=776" target="_blank">00:12:56.920</a></span> | <span class="t">That the total effect of anything is a combined product of what you're doing and what you think about what you're doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=783" target="_blank">00:13:03.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And we found a group of people who were getting a lot of exercise, but weren't aware of it, a group of hotel housekeepers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=790" target="_blank">00:13:10.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So these are women working in hotels who were on their feet all day long, pushing carts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=797" target="_blank">00:13:17.420</a></span> | <span class="t">It was clear that they were getting above and beyond at least the surgeon general's requirements at that time, which were to accumulate 30 minutes of moderate physical activity per day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=807" target="_blank">00:13:27.260</a></span> | <span class="t">But what was interesting was when we went in and surveyed them and asked them, hey, how much exercise do you think you're getting?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=815" target="_blank">00:13:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">A third of them said zero, and the average response was like a three on a scale of zero to 10.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=821" target="_blank">00:13:41.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's clear that even though these women were active, they didn't have that mindset, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=827" target="_blank">00:13:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">They had the mindset that their work was just work, hard, maybe thankless work that led them to feel tired and, you know, in pain at the end of the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=837" target="_blank">00:13:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But not that it was good for them, that it was good exercise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=840" target="_blank">00:14:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So what we did was we took these women and we randomized them into two groups and we told half of them that their work was good exercise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=849" target="_blank">00:14:09.640</a></span> | <span class="t">In this case, it was true, factual information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=852" target="_blank">00:14:12.360</a></span> | <span class="t">We oriented them to the surgeon general's guidelines.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=855" target="_blank">00:14:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">We oriented them to the benefits that they should be receiving.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=858" target="_blank">00:14:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we had measured them previously on their physiological metrics like weight and body fat and blood pressure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=866" target="_blank">00:14:26.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And we came back four weeks later and we tested them again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=870" target="_blank">00:14:30.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And what we found was that these women, even though they hadn't changed anything in their behavior, they had benefits to their health.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=878" target="_blank">00:14:38.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So they lost weight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=879" target="_blank">00:14:39.220</a></span> | <span class="t">They decreased their systolic blood pressure by about 10 points on average.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=883" target="_blank">00:14:43.960</a></span> | <span class="t">What this reveals is that we have to be more thoughtful in how we go about motivating people to exercise or teaching people about the benefits.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=894" target="_blank">00:14:54.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Our current approach is just to basically tell people writ large, you know, here's what you need to get.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=901" target="_blank">00:15:01.940</a></span> | <span class="t">The intention with that is to motivate them because, you know, public health officials think, well, if I just tell people you need to get more exercise because it's good for you, they'll do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=909" target="_blank">00:15:09.700</a></span> | <span class="t">But we know now that that doesn't work, that these these guidelines are not motivational.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=914" target="_blank">00:15:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">They don't change our behavior.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=915" target="_blank">00:15:15.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And what our work adds to that is that not only is it not motivational, it also creates potentially a mindset that, you know, makes people worse off than they were without knowing about the guidelines.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=930" target="_blank">00:15:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I'd love for us to talk about stress because your lab has worked extensively on this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=936" target="_blank">00:15:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Could you tell us at some point about the study that you've done about informing people about the different effects of stress?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=941" target="_blank">00:15:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But also if there's an opportunity, some takeaways about how we could each conceptualize stress in ways that would make it serve us better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=951" target="_blank">00:15:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=952" target="_blank">00:15:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so I had, you know, I'd come off the heels of doing some research in exercise and diet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=959" target="_blank">00:15:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">The obvious next thing to think about was stress, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=963" target="_blank">00:16:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">The public health message was very clear, right, that stress was bad, right, unmitigated and harmful on our health, our productivity, our relationships, our fertility, our cognition.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=979" target="_blank">00:16:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">You name it, right, the messages that were out there, by and large, oversimplified messages focused on the damaging consequences of stress.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=990" target="_blank">00:16:30.040</a></span> | <span class="t">But as you know, if you actually dive deeper into the literature on stress and the origins of stress, what you find is that, you know, the literature, like most literatures, is not so clear cut.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1000" target="_blank">00:16:40.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And in fact, there's a large amount of evidence to support the fact that the experience of stress, meaning encountering adversity or challenge in one's goal-related efforts, does not have to be debilitating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1015" target="_blank">00:16:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And in many cases, the body's response was designed to enhance our ability to manage at those moments, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1023" target="_blank">00:17:03.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So some research showing that stress narrows our focus, increases our attention, speeds up the rate at which we're able to process information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1032" target="_blank">00:17:12.440</a></span> | <span class="t">There was some research out there showing this phenomenon of physiological toughening, the process by which the release of catabolic hormones and the stress response recruit or activate anabolic hormones,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1045" target="_blank">00:17:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">which help, as you know, build our muscles, build our, you know, neurons to help us grow and learn.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1050" target="_blank">00:17:30.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And there was a whole body of emerging research on post-traumatic growth or this phenomenon in which even the experience of the most traumatic stressors,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1059" target="_blank">00:17:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the most chronic and enduring stressors, could lead not to destruction, but in fact to the exact opposite,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1067" target="_blank">00:17:47.260</a></span> | <span class="t">to an enhanced sense of connection with our values, connection to others, sense of joy and passion for living.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1077" target="_blank">00:17:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">My work since then has been not to try to argue that stress is enhancing and not debilitating,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1083" target="_blank">00:18:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">but try to point out that the true nature of stress is a paradox.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1088" target="_blank">00:18:08.360</a></span> | <span class="t">The true nature of stress is manifold and complex and lots of things can happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1094" target="_blank">00:18:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But to question, what's the role of our mindset about stress in shaping our response to stress?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1101" target="_blank">00:18:21.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So some work had already been done looking at your perception of the stressor, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1107" target="_blank">00:18:27.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So do you view a stressor like a challenging exam or a health diagnosis as a challenge or a threat?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1114" target="_blank">00:18:34.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And that had shown pretty convincingly that when you view stressors more as a challenge, less as a threat,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1120" target="_blank">00:18:40.860</a></span> | <span class="t">that your brain and body response more adaptively.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1125" target="_blank">00:18:45.740</a></span> | <span class="t">What our question was, was to take the sort of psychological construal one step higher in abstraction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1131" target="_blank">00:18:51.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So not just the stressor, but the nature of stress, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1135" target="_blank">00:18:55.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you, you know, at that core level, do you view stress as something that's bad,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1141" target="_blank">00:19:01.380</a></span> | <span class="t">is going to kill us and therefore should be avoided?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1144" target="_blank">00:19:04.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Or do you view some stress as natural and something that's going to enhance us?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1149" target="_blank">00:19:09.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we set out to design a series of studies to test the extent to which these mindsets about stress mattered.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1158" target="_blank">00:19:18.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And we found in a number of correlational studies that that more enhancing stress mindset was linked to better health outcomes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1166" target="_blank">00:19:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">better well-being and higher performance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1169" target="_blank">00:19:29.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So then we set out to see if we could change people's mindsets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1174" target="_blank">00:19:34.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And in our first test of this, we decided to do so by creating these multimedia films that showcased research, anecdotes, facts about stress,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1185" target="_blank">00:19:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">all true, but oriented towards one mindset or the other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1190" target="_blank">00:19:50.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can imagine one set of films showed basically the messages that were out there in the public health context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1196" target="_blank">00:19:56.680</a></span> | <span class="t">The other showed, hey, you know, stress is, you know, stress has been linked to these things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1202" target="_blank">00:20:02.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But in fact, the body stress response was designed to do this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1205" target="_blank">00:20:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Did you know it could do that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1206" target="_blank">00:20:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And we had empowering images like LeBron James making the free throw in the final minute versus missing it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1213" target="_blank">00:20:13.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So either people saw a video that basically made it seem like stress will diminish you, crush you, reduce you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1219" target="_blank">00:20:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">or a video, very similar stress will grow you, bring out your best, and maybe even take you to heightened levels of performance that you've never experienced before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1229" target="_blank">00:20:29.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Exactly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1230" target="_blank">00:20:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And our question was, does orienting people to different mindsets change how they respond to stress?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1237" target="_blank">00:20:37.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So this study was done in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1242" target="_blank">00:20:42.040</a></span> | <span class="t">We worked with UBS, a company, a financial service company that was undergoing pretty massive amounts of layoffs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1250" target="_blank">00:20:50.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So these employees were stressed about being laid off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1253" target="_blank">00:20:53.640</a></span> | <span class="t">They were taking on more pressure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1255" target="_blank">00:20:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">It was just a tough time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1256" target="_blank">00:20:56.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And we randomized them into three conditions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1260" target="_blank">00:21:00.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And this was all pre-work before getting a training on stress.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1265" target="_blank">00:21:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">But the three different conditions, some watched no videos, some watched the stress will crush you videos,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1271" target="_blank">00:21:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and some watched the stress could enhance you videos.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1274" target="_blank">00:21:14.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And what we found was that just, you know, it was a total of nine minutes of videos over the course of the week</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1280" target="_blank">00:21:20.920</a></span> | <span class="t">led to changes in their mindsets about stress, which led to changes in their physiological symptoms associated with stress.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1289" target="_blank">00:21:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So people who watched the enhancing films had fewer back aches, muscle tension, insomnia, racing heart, and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1297" target="_blank">00:21:37.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And they also reported performing better at work compared to those who watched the debilitating videos.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1304" target="_blank">00:21:44.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, interestingly, we didn't make anyone worse with the debilitating videos, which was good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1309" target="_blank">00:21:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">We had told the IRB we didn't expect that because that message was already out there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1315" target="_blank">00:21:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what they were already seeing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1317" target="_blank">00:21:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">That wasn't new to them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1318" target="_blank">00:21:58.900</a></span> | <span class="t">It was more this enhancing perspective that turned out to be inspiring.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1324" target="_blank">00:22:04.360</a></span> | <span class="t">People get this wrong sometimes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1326" target="_blank">00:22:06.180</a></span> | <span class="t">They think that I'm saying that a stress-as-enhancing mindset means you should like stress.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1331" target="_blank">00:22:11.820</a></span> | <span class="t">That's not what we're saying, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1333" target="_blank">00:22:13.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Having a stress-as-enhancing mindset doesn't mean the stressor is a good thing, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1338" target="_blank">00:22:18.520</a></span> | <span class="t">It doesn't mean that getting a cancer diagnosis is a good thing or being in abject poverty is a good thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1344" target="_blank">00:22:24.680</a></span> | <span class="t">These are not good things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1346" target="_blank">00:22:26.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But the experience of the stress associated with that, the challenge, the adversity, that experience can lead to enhancing outcomes with respect to not just our cognition, but our health, our performance, and our well-being.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1362" target="_blank">00:22:42.860</a></span> | <span class="t">How does that work, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1364" target="_blank">00:22:44.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, it works through a number of different pathways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1367" target="_blank">00:22:47.380</a></span> | <span class="t">One is that it changes fundamentally what we're motivated to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1372" target="_blank">00:22:52.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you, you know, just imagine we're stressed about something and you think that stress is bad, then what's your motivation, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1381" target="_blank">00:23:01.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Your motivation is to, well, first you get worried about the stress, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1385" target="_blank">00:23:05.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And second is your reaction is typically to do one of two things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1388" target="_blank">00:23:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Because it's either to freak out and do everything you can to make sure that this doesn't affect you, you know, negatively, or to check out and say, oh, it's not a big deal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1398" target="_blank">00:23:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not going to deal with it.</span></div><div

and we've shown this in our research, tend to go to one or the other of those extremes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1407" target="_blank">00:23:27.460</a></span> | <span class="t">They freak out or they check out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1409"

target="_blank">00:23:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Because if stress is bad, you need to either get rid of it and deal with it or it needs to not exist, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1415" target="_blank">00:23:35.640</a></span> | <span class="t">If you have a stress-as-enhancing mindset, the motivation changes, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1420" target="_blank">00:23:40.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Then the motivation is how do I utilize the stress to realize the enhancing outcomes?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1426" target="_blank">00:23:46.440</a></span> | <span class="t">What can we do here, right, to learn from this experience to make us stronger, fitter, you know, have better science and treatments for the future, deepen my relationships with others?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1439" target="_blank">00:23:59.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Improve, you know, my

motivation changes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1445" target="_blank">00:24:05.320</a></span> | <span class="t">The affect around

research is that people who have a stress-as-enhancing mindset have more positive affect, not necessarily less negative affect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1457" target="_blank">00:24:17.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And it potentially changes physiology.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

more enhancing mindsets have more moderate cortisol response and they have higher levels of DHEA levels in response to stress.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

this through first-time skydive or something like that, that testosterone went up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1502" target="_blank">00:25:02.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Now this spits in the face of everything that we're told about stress and testosterone levels, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1508" target="_blank">00:25:08.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So it turns out that at least in the short term, that a very stressful event can raise anabolic hormones.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1516" target="_blank">00:25:16.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that people forget at a mechanistic level that adrenaline is epinephrine and epinephrine is derived, biochemically derived from the molecule dopamine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1526" target="_blank">00:25:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">If you look at the pathway and even just Google it and go images, you'll see that adrenaline is made from dopamine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1532" target="_blank">00:25:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And dopamine and these anabolic hormones have a very close, they're sort of close cousins.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1537" target="_blank">00:25:37.160</a></span> | <span class="t">They work together in the pituitary and hypothalamus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1539" target="_blank">00:25:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So it makes sense that one could leverage stress toward growth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1545" target="_blank">00:25:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But what's again remarkable to me is that all of these brain structures that control dopamine, epinephrine, testosterone and estrogen, they're all thought to be in the subconscious, meaning below our ability to flip a switch and turn them on or off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1559" target="_blank">00:25:59.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And yet mindset seemed to impact them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1561" target="_blank">00:26:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So all that to say that there's a clear mechanistic basis by which this could all work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1569" target="_blank">00:26:09.180</a></span> | <span class="t">The way I think about mindset is that it's, mindsets are kind of a portal between conscious and subconscious processes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1577" target="_blank">00:26:17.820</a></span> | <span class="t">They operate as a default setting of the mind, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1583" target="_blank">00:26:23.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So if, you know, if sort of programmed in there, you have stress equals bad.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1590" target="_blank">00:26:30.740</a></span> | <span class="t">That's been programmed in through our upbringing, through public health messages and through media and other things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1598" target="_blank">00:26:38.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And it kind of sits there as an assumption in the brain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1601" target="_blank">00:26:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And the brain is then figuring out how should it respond to this situation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1606" target="_blank">00:26:46.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And if the assumption, the default, the programming is stress is bad, that's going to, through our subconscious, trigger all the things that's like, okay, well, I need to like, you know, rev up the things that protect me versus rev up the things that help me grow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1624" target="_blank">00:27:04.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So just talking about this, you know, just talking about this, right, for your listeners, they're now invited to bring their stress mindsets up to the consciousness and say, what is my stress mindset?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1634" target="_blank">00:27:14.860</a></span> | <span class="t">How am I thinking about stress?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1637" target="_blank">00:27:17.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Can I reprogram that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1638" target="_blank">00:27:18.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Can I start to think about it as more enhancing?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1641" target="_blank">00:27:21.480</a></span> | <span class="t">That takes a little bit of a conscious work potentially.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1645" target="_blank">00:27:25.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But then once you do that, it can, that can kind of operate in the background, influencing how your body responds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1652" target="_blank">00:27:32.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And you don't have to say, okay, I'm stressed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1653" target="_blank">00:27:33.740</a></span> | <span class="t">I better tell my, you know, anabolic hormones.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1657" target="_blank">00:27:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That doesn't work that way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1658" target="_blank">00:27:38.700</a></span> | <span class="t">No.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1659" target="_blank">00:27:39.300</a></span> | <span class="t">But these mindsets can help with the translational process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1663" target="_blank">00:27:43.420</a></span> | <span class="t">How should we, the listeners, think about stress?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1668" target="_blank">00:27:48.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Is there a short list of ways that we can leverage stress to our advantage?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1673" target="_blank">00:27:53.920</a></span> | <span

important, important nuance in your language, which is people have, by and large, come from a place of how do you manage stress?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1683" target="_blank">00:28:03.080</a></span> | <span class="t">How do you cope with it, which implies how do you fight against it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1687" target="_blank">00:28:07.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And yeah, the real challenge is how do we leverage it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1690" target="_blank">00:28:10.940</a></span> | <span class="t">How do we utilize it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1692" target="_blank">00:28:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">How do we work with it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1693" target="_blank">00:28:13.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And I have a lot of thoughts on this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1696" target="_blank">00:28:16.220</a></span> | <span class="t">The first and most important thing is to clarify our definition of stress.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1702" target="_blank">00:28:22.360</a></span> | <span class="t">The stress mind, negative stress mindset is so insidious that now people define stress with its negative consequences.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1712" target="_blank">00:28:32.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first step is to decouple that and to realize that stress is a neutral, right, yet-to-be-determined effect of experiencing or anticipating adversity in your goal-related efforts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1728" target="_blank">00:28:48.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So let me unpack that a little more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1730" target="_blank">00:28:50.460</a></span> | <span class="t">You can be in the midst of it, or you could just be worried about something happening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1735" target="_blank">00:28:55.300</a></span> | <span class="t">That's one aspect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1736" target="_blank">00:28:56.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Second is adversity or challenge, so something that's working against you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1741" target="_blank">00:29:01.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But the third piece is critical, and that is in your goal-related efforts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1746" target="_blank">00:29:06.060</a></span> | <span class="t">What that means is that we only stress about things we care about, and we don't stress about things we don't care about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1754" target="_blank">00:29:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So then the question becomes, okay, if that's true, how can I better utilize or leverage or respond to the inevitable stresses that we're going to experience?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1766" target="_blank">00:29:26.220</a></span> | <span class="t">We've developed a three-step approach to adopting a stress-enhancing mindset.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1771" target="_blank">00:29:31.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And briefly, it's the first step is to just acknowledge that you're stressed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1776" target="_blank">00:29:36.680</a></span> | <span class="t">The second step is to welcome it, because inherently in that stress is something you care about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1783" target="_blank">00:29:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the third step is to utilize the stress response to achieve the thing that you care about, not spend your time, money, effort, energy trying to get rid of the stress.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1795" target="_blank">00:29:55.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Does that make sense?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1796" target="_blank">00:29:56.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Makes sense, and I love it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1798" target="_blank">00:29:58.140</a></span> | <span class="t">As somebody whose laboratory studies the physiological effects of stress, the effects that impress me the most are, for instance, the narrowing of visual attention that then drives a capacity to parse time more finely, which then drives the capacity to process information faster.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1816" target="_blank">00:30:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">It's almost like a superpower.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1817" target="_blank">00:30:17.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1817" target="_blank">00:30:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And what I like so much about that framework is that the stress response is very generic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1823" target="_blank">00:30:23.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Unlike the relaxation response, we don't actually have to train up the stress response.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1827" target="_blank">00:30:27.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So we all kind of get this as a freebie.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1829" target="_blank">00:30:29.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And then it sounds like it's a question of what we end up doing with that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1832" target="_blank">00:30:32.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1833" target="_blank">00:30:33.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Treat yourself like a scientist.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1834" target="_blank">00:30:34.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Look at your life.</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1840" target="_blank">00:30:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Find more useful, adaptive, and empowering mindsets and live by those.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1846" target="_blank">00:30:46.840</a></span> | <span class="t">What are the mindsets that you try and adopt on a regular basis?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1851" target="_blank">00:30:51.080</a></span> | <span class="t">The guiding light for me has been an undercurrent of understanding that our mindsets matter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1858" target="_blank">00:30:58.540</a></span> | <span class="t">I think I got that very clearly and deeply as a child, both through my experiences as an athlete.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1864" target="_blank">00:31:04.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I know many of your listeners are athletes.</span></div><div

chance when you get up there on the balance beam.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1887" target="_blank">00:31:27.880</a></span> |

target="_blank">00:31:37.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think what I've done recently is to try to understand it scientifically and more importantly, to figure out how can we, how can we do better with this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alVWRl_X_AA&t=1908" target="_blank">00:31:48.640</a></span> | <span
