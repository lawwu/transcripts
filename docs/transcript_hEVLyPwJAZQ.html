fine i don't give a about longevity or quantum computing but here's the good news david it's not all about you there's four people you could have two people who like the topic and then you could just ask them a probing that's fine it's fine just tell me when it's over i'll do you know let your winners ride brain man david sacks hey everybody hey everybody welcome to the all in podcast i'm jason calacanis and with us today again the queen of quinoa david friedberg sans his dog in the background sorry for those of you who love his dog he's on a walk he'll be back in like 10 he'll be back and he'll be in the seat uh and the rain man himself david sacks ultra focused on sas and marketplace startups and involved in some illegal trafficking of red pills straight up from honduras to cuba and then through miami making the red pills making their way to california and finally daddy's back the spac master himself bestie c the dictator is replenished bank account replenished he's been re-billionized firing on all cylinders oh it's so so you know live by the spac die by the smack that's what they always say in this business but you know what we have been absolutely inundated with i kid you not hundreds of questions from you our loyal audience and when this thing is over we are going on world tour we'll see you in vegas we'll see you uh in uh at the royal albert hall in uh london and we're going to be back in a couple of weeks and we're going to be back in a couple of weeks and we're going to be back in a couple of weeks and we're going to be back in a couple of weeks and we're going to be back in a couple of weeks uh in uh at the royal albert hall in uh london and we're going to be back in a couple of weeks and we're going to be back in a couple of weeks uh in uh at the royal albert hall in uh london and miami all cities are on the agenda let's take our first question from you the audience to what extent are you guys wait how's everyone doing i thought we didn't see the questions but how's our i mean look at this guy he got his ass kicked and he's back i'm doing really really great what about the rest of you guys you guys played poker this week we played poker it was a bloodbath well although you know it's so funny because like we played i played uh uh a very big game the week before and then we step into our game which is like i think still quite big but i could not rub two cards together to make a hand and i uh i went off like a rocket ship i just lost it somewhere along the way and just despite that despite that every time i chamath and i were heads up at hand he just smashed absolutely smashed me smashed and then i was like you know what i'm not going to be bullied anymore and then i stand up to him and he's got the nuts each time uh i was down i didn't know that i was going to be bullied anymore and then i stand up to him and he's got the nuts each time uh i was down i didn't know that i was going to be bullied anymore and then i stand up to him and he's got the nuts each time uh i was down i didn't know that i was going to be bullied anymore and then i stand up to him and he's got the nuts each time uh i was down i did check out i did run you over i mean the number of just complete bluffs i ran on you oh that's crazy and i'm just like he's totally got my number tonight after bluff after bluff and then i showed him the nuts five times in a row it was beautiful so i'm stuck a model y and i come back and i win a used prius i'm just leaving it at that i lost a mid-sized home in phoenix arizona i think you lost a betley okay don't cancel us uh please uh sax jack did you play i wasn't there in that game but i played in uh la game a couple of nights ago and uh any celebrities yeah me me sax and oh god you guys don't count your podcasters no there was one there was one unnamed celebrity we can't say what what an actor no we can't say but we all won well just give us a genre i mean an athlete okay yeah i won in in that game but i lost uh i lost a different game this past week and it wasn't pretty yeah wait sexy sexy are you what game you're playing yeah i think he may be playing actually i mean beep that out would you nick beep it out but we can all laugh at him for being so precious oh you i'm sorry do you lps think you're supposed to be in san francisco investing in startups no no they know i go wherever the deals are oh really miami what are you gonna do would you get a deal on some croquettes and a cuban sandwich two for one there's no copies there when do you think you'll make an investment in a miami-based company you think that'll happen anytime it's happened already that's what happened are you in the new free are you in the new reboy i've invested in a miami company i've got like six yeah i well there's some companies that are moving to miami that i'm already in you know chamath and i are both in pipe right and and uh part at least the ceo of the company just moved to miami so that's two of four two or four besties in pipe thanks by the way how did you miss that jcal they they advertise on your show and you didn't think to try and invest that the lp beep that we all share wanted everything and he couldn't fit me in and i was like how about a slice and he's like is that lp me no there's another lp that sax and i share who got their beak significantly doused in that one but i'm just gonna i'm gonna get the kid to give me a 25 basis points in uh advisor share so i'm getting a slice no matter what yeah good good luck with that good luck with that good luck the trains off the station the trains off the station dude that that that company's worth a couple billion dollars in less than two years of its existence good luck with that jason okay well it's i we call it a make good i don't know what you guys are seeing but my god early stage valuations went bonkers i had one company that raised that that was looking at run it i have all kinds of data okay right so today we're going to do some audience questions and then we're going to do the state of vc we're running through a deck we're running through everything that is changing right now in venture capital and early stage investing and it is changing very quickly here's a question what's the best way to get a good deal on a company that's going to make a lot of money in the future and what's the best way to get a good deal on a company that's going to make a lot of money in the future and what's the best way to get a good deal here's a question from leonard uh omazix to what extent are you guys interested in longevity in your opinion what technologies could help us live longer and healthier lives friedberg that's got your name on it why don't we start with you um on this one i would uh point folks to read the book lifespan by david sinclair who's a researcher at harvard and he's done a lot of kind of leading work on um on uh basically calling aging a disease and life extension so the book lifespan highlights i think a lot of his research and findings and paths forward uh for um for improving uh longevity and basically you know comes down to what he defines as kind of an early switch that evolved in evolutionary biology in every cell on every living organism where the cell is either in growth mode or repair mode and the trick is can you get the gene to switch on that puts the cell into repair mode and if you do that you're going to have a lot of problems with that and so i think that's a really good point and i think that's a really good point and i think that's a really good point and i think that's a really good point and i think that's a really good point the cell fixes itself and you and the cell lasts longer the cell fixes itself and you and the cell lasts longer the cell fixes itself and you and the cell lasts longer the organism lives longer the organism lives longer and so they've identified a number of and so they've identified a number of and so they've identified a number of genes that trigger this and a number of genes that trigger this and a number of genes that trigger this and a number of compounds that trigger expression of compounds that trigger expression of compounds that trigger expression of those genes those genes those genes and there's a number of things you can and there's a number of things you can and there's a number of things you can do lifestyle wise to trigger these genes do lifestyle wise to trigger these genes basically to get yourself to live longer so fasting is a good one and then there's a bunch of compounds that you can take that mimic fasting on a cellular level like metformin and rapamycin i'm on metformin i think a couple of you guys are on metformin right yeah and then and then the nad plus supplements um which you can buy you take m nmn substance yeah nmn nmn and nad plus um so there's two there's two compounds nmn like nancy mike nancy um and then nr um and those uh you can buy a product called true niagen on amazon which which has those compounds and you take about a thousand milligrams a day and um anyway all of this stuff's laid out in his books and it supports a lot of the research that's being done obviously fasting and exercise also trigger this gene expression and enable kind of measures of longevity uh to kind of be showing up biologically but um i think i think it's a it's an emerging field and there's a lot of deep work going on and as people have highlighted the process of aging is a biological process that theoretically we can stop and potentially reverse and there's a lot of new work that's being done in stem cell therapy that may kind of elicit some new paths forward here so arguably someone is alive on planet earth today that could live past the age of 200.</p><p>um so it's an exciting field and lots of kind of paths forward i'll uh i'll tell you for what it's worth my regimen um and oh god here we go thirst trap photo coming in no uh so so i i do uh the the following so um i take uh a statin now it was 10 milligrams now i'm at 20 milligrams um i take metformin and all of this i take sort of in a preventative posture um because my cholesterol wasn't super high but it wasn't super low it was like sort of like in the 160 170 180 but now it's sort of like 120.</p><p>um and then metformin i take preventatively as well i'm not pre-diabetic um and then a couple of vitamin d and some other stuff but then here are these things that i do that i think could be valuable for some folks listening uh there are these places now that exist they're popping up one company that you can check out is called pre-nuvo p-r-e-n-u-v-o um they're in vancouver they're in la they're in redwood city so mid peninsula for those in silicon valley and what you can do is you can get a head to toe uh mri so you know there's no radiation you know you could do these things you know every other week if you wanted to it takes about an hour and what happens is they can basically uh look through your entire body um your musculature your organs um from the literally from the tip of your head all the way down to your ankles and they can spot a lot of stuff that may not otherwise uh be seen and so you know every three or four years to get one of these scans you could see a lesion um you could see the beginnings of a tumor um you know i did one a few weeks ago touchwood it was great nothing nothing so much does it cost um there's a range of prices um and i think those prices will come down the range of prices are from like 1500 to 2500 so it's not expense it's not cheap sorry but here's what they're able to do they're building a corpus of all these images where they're running uh machine learning on it and they're getting better and better at identifying anomalies and so as a result of that they're able to actually take the mri images and they can do fewer and fewer scans to get the equivalent resolution so two things will happen one is the scan time will come down right so it was an hour and a half now it's sort of right under an hour it can probably be as low as 40 minutes which is relatively tolerable for most people and then the cost will come down into the hundreds of dollars because you'll be able to very rapidly assess um so i do that and then the second thing is for anybody with heart disease in their family i really implore you one of my friends actually is flying down from toronto i'm taking him to my cardiologist in la and there's a thing called heart flow and what heart flow is is a contrast ct which basically means they inject it into the heart and they're able to get the heart to die and then they put you under a ct and they they map out your heart and you can literally see the calcium build up you can see the state of your arteries um and you know what probably people don't know is when you have a calcium score you know most of us it's zero but when it starts to be non-zero it doubles every year and by the time it gets into the thousands you're basically guaranteed to get some form of cardiac issue um and so it doesn't seem like anything if your cardiac score is 20 except it goes to 40 80 once a year and then you're like oh my god i'm gonna die 60 and all of a sudden within five six years you're really in the red zone for a heart attack or something um i've done it twice now um every five years i do it um and touch wood you know my my calcium score is still zero um but in any event uh that's what i do for longevity i kind of preventatively at the cellular level with some drugs and then just trying to catch cancer and heart disease on the front end otherwise eat three balanced meals and exercise and sleep a lot sax uh you obviously don't care about longevity uh any thoughts here i mean sax has looked like he's a thousand years old since he was seven no he was when he was in 12th grade he looked like he was a vice president united states yeah guys just just let just let me know when this conversation is over i've been doing my email oh that's so great all right here we go end my life now i hate it you don't you guys like i just lost two years right now sax has got an early spot both on the rocket ship to mars and he's got an inside vip to peter thiel's blood boy project and so either way he's getting off the planet or he's going to refresh his blood or both so he's good all right action bias asks please debate decentralization of monetary value ultimate threat for insider's power erosion i interpret this as a as a bitcoin question so yeah i think one of the most interesting things happening in the world today is is this is what's happening with bitcoin right it's and and you're seeing the price go up because a bunch of institutional investors on wall street are all getting into it now it's gone from retail to institutional and the narrative basically it's a really profound narrative which is it's the separation of money and state so if you think about like one of the most important events in human history was the separation of church and state where we no longer look to the state to determine you know what religion everyone was going to be well what crypto is introducing is this idea that the government cannot control the money supply i think that's what he's talking about with the decentralization is that you could have a currency that everybody in the world believes in that no government can control that's the separation of money and state now this is just really a narrative right now um i mean and who knows if it will actually come true but the interesting thing is that if everybody does believe in it it will come true and so bitcoin's been sort of described as the bub that never ends because if everyone kind of buys into this bubble it actually comes true so i think it's very interesting and you're seeing um because bitcoin is kind of perceived as the antidote to inflation and money printing by the government uh i think you're seeing it take on new urgency now because the government just keeps printing trillions and trillions of dollars of of new money doesn't this threaten government so if government um doesn't have control over monitoring financial transactions and have control over the accounts in which the financial assets sit which is effectively the notion of decentralized anonymized wallets then um how does the government secure taxation which is requisite for their ability to fund well the good the fund the state right and so what happens to the state well so there's an enormous amount of leakage that happens today in assets that actually get financialized but in the gray market and i think the the beautiful thing is on the one hand you know we become less focused on like the m one and the m2 money supply like the physical printable distributable money that we can see and touch and it gets replaced with virtual currencies that are tied to other things i think what the the the the person who wrote the question is asking really is more about d5 and what's happening sort of like on the ethereum you know 2.0 erc20 contracts all that stuff which is sort of much more next gen i think than bitcoin and i think at some point we should deep dive into it but what i would say friedberg is all the leakage you have today goes away in a world of d5 because you will financialize every single asset possible you know you'll financialize your homes you'll financialize your cars your watches your jewelry your art you'll financialize every random thing maybe even your career and how people will trade it absolutely your career and and the thing is by by monetizing it and financializing it you can borrow against it you can trade it you can pull forward value into the future against it but it'll all be tracked and so as long as a government then says listen you're going to have to do this listen we're going to enable it all but there needs to be an off-ramp to taxation and that's pretty simple because a physical house exists in the world you can't hide the existence of a physical house but it's not anonymized right and so i you know if you want to track it i mean that's the challenge if no i'm saying if it is anonymized then the government can't track it and the government can't these are these are two separate things some assets will live anonymously and those are the assets that don't need to exist in the real world but i think what this will create is a world where all of these assets that actually truly exist in the real world it'll be fine that it exists and that people get taxed on it but it'll be much more legitimate and i think it'll be simpler and so i think people will trade off incremental taxation for incremental monetizability i'll give you an example let's use real estate there is no reason why every single piece of land everywhere around the world isn't written into a ledger with knowledge of who owns it such that the person that owns it could trade it could borrow against it um could sell it um fractionalize it fractionalize it even if you can't fractionalize in the real world because your neighbors won't let you set it up into four lots you could do that online online and so today what will happen is that you know that person has a level of wealth and what they do instead take the united states is they lobby lobby lobby to create all this convoluted real estate tax law to make their life simpler but if you actually invest in real estate you're going to have a lot of money and you're going to have a lot of money to spend but if you actually invest in real estate you're going to have a lot of money to spend but if you actually invest in real estate you're going to have a lot of money to spend but if you actually invest in real estate you're going to have a lot of money to spend but if you actually invest in real estate you're going to have a lot of money to spend but if you judge just to you know sort of answer the question here from the from the reader from the listener i think you can really judge this based upon how much it's being pumped by the people who own it and they are absolutely dogged religious about this it's like talking to and you know a person who's you know met jesus and now everybody has to be a christian and you can also look at the people who are opposing it i don't know if you saw yellen um and then um christine lagarde she came out against it yellen's come out against it india might ban it and then you have obviously china's coming out their digital one so i think it's going to be there's going to be a dogfight here where governments are not going to easily give up their control of this and there's many ways they can make a bunch of red tape to slow this down and in countries that are authoritarian they cannot write ban it let's take another question here by the way there's like three outcomes here right i mean you could either see bitcoin for example you know being banned and that's going to be ugly um and obviously there would be significant financial loss at this point i mean to sax's point at some point there's so much asset value tied up in bitcoin it's it's too big to fail so david banned by who oh that that's chinese government this is what they're trying to do on some of the states right and they're trying to make it illegal for citizens to transfer money in and out of the asset class i think it's a bigger threat to want to impose export or currency controls and and export restrictions but but frankly if you're a country that's not afraid of currency movements because you're not trying to do something oppressive to your people i don't think you have that much to fear here i mean there are other ways of trying to hide assets or hide money besides bitcoin and every transaction every bitcoin transaction is written into the ledger i think you have to be pretty dumb to try and commit a crime with bitcoin because there's going to be a permanent record in the blockchain forever of that transfer and then there's companies that are going to be able to do that and then there's companies that that provide uh that do kind of sleuthing and try to you know unravel you think tax evasion in the united states is going to be difficult um with bitcoin if i accrue a bunch of value in bitcoin am i going to be able to evade paying taxes on those gains and convert that bitcoin into physical assets by purchasing it from another bitcoin wallet holder i mean how realistic is tax evasion going to be uh and how much would because that's ultimately what the us government would mostly well so you would convert cash into bitcoin and then you want to sell your bitcoin at some point you're going to have to sell it i mean there would be a there'd be a a realization of it i'm saying transfer to a seller of an asset of another asset that's willing to accept bitcoin in receipt and so two anonymized wallets i don't know i mean that that transaction is going to live on the blockchain forever and it's going to live in the books of whoever the seller is what are they selling you a car a house whatever i mean that that trans a watch i mean look if it's a personal item maybe but if we're talking about a substantial asset i mean if it's a personal item maybe but if we're talking about a substantial asset like a house or a company or something they're going to need to the other side of the transaction is going to need to report the realization event so you're going to have to have two people collude to engage in tax evasion seems like a really stupid thing to do legally incorporated businesses are going to be mandated to do effectively identity verification much like we have to do under the patriot act with all the the financial laws totally totally yeah ultimately how the compromise arises right yeah i'm not i i'm not that worried about i i feel like this whole like silk road type bitcoin will be used illegally thing is like kind of a old meme about it that i think that the fears are like greatly exaggerated but the thing that jumps out at me about all the critics of bitcoin and i'm not like a pump or whatever but i do i do own some um is the thing that like all these like critics don't seem to understand is the technology that's the common denominator whether it's like howard marx or warren buffett or charlie munger or whoever they're they're all like great investors or whatever but they're not technically technologists it's a blind spot and the thing they don't understand about the technology is that bitcoin is the first digital asset to ever be created that you can't create infinite copies of right so think about like a song or a photo or a video or whatever anything that's digital you've always been able to make an infinite number of copies isn't that what the word digital means is that it's infinitely copyable so how do you have digital money that can't just be infinitely copied obviously that would destroy the value and that's what's happening with bitcoin right now bitcoin is a digital asset to every transaction and that's why bitcoin is so important because it's a digital asset to every transaction and that's why bitcoin is so important because it's a digital asset to every transaction and that's why bitcoin is so important because it's a digital asset to every transaction and that's
