Or do they like secretly wish that they could put a red flag on all of our accounts and close us all down? I think we represent such a small number that they probably don't care.</p><p>I think it's like reminiscent of the casinos where there's people that can't count cards. You actually want people to think that they can go in and count cards and like movies that's like propagate. But like the average person, just even if they mentally can to it, they're not going to spend the time to learn how to do it.</p><p>So by having this whole thing like, oh, you can get money, but maybe they don't do enough research, then they end up losing. But the people that watch videos and like read blogs are probably already a lot ahead of everyone else.</p></div></div></body></html>
