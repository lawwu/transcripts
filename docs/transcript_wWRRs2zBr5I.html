I'm Jesse, founder and CEO of Morph Labs. I'll be telling you today about how we're enabling the rise of the AI software engineer. Programming is evolving. Programming was once called automatic programming. Logarithms used to be considered human knowledge work. One day, we'll think about how engineering was once called AI engineering, and how intelligence used to be called artificial general intelligence.</p><p>And along the way, we will command legions of AI software engineers to write the code for us. Here at Morph Labs, our mission is to bring the personal AI software engineer to everyone. The personal AI software engineer will understand you, the best practices for your software, your favorite idioms.</p><p>The personal AI software engineer will understand your code base better than you do. Its capabilities will evolve with you and your code, and it will always stay up to date. The personal AI software engineer will augment you at every stage of the software development lifecycle, from ideation and specification to implementation testing and deployment.</p><p>I'm proud to announce the Morph Code Index, a major milestone towards the personal AI software engineer. The Morph Code Index is a neuro-symbolic code database for you and your coding assistant. With it, you can run semantic searches with natural language over your code base, make your entire code base and Git history visible to your coding assistant, and transmute your code base into training data for your personal AI software engineer.</p><p>So let's dive into what it does. The Morph Code Index helps you find relevant code faster. We use static analysis, vector embeddings, and graph algorithms to create a state of the art code search index. The Morph Code Index also ships with a neuro-symbolic query language, which can be used to guarantee precise results.</p><p>The code index is the only AI-native code search engine. It will make your coding assistant smarter. With our Python bindings, it will be easy to attach a Morph Code Index to any coding assistant to give it code base-wide context via retrieval. Finally, the Morph Code Index can traverse your code base to generate vast quantities of training data.</p><p>We've already used this exact pipeline to train our newly released Riff Coder 7b model, which is the only open source model for code editing that can run on your laptop and in your IDE. All you have to do is index your code, run the generation script, and you can start training your personal AI software engineer.</p><p>Here at Morph Labs, we believe the future of software should belong to everyone. That's why the Morph Code Index is open source, transparent, and free. Your code. Your data. Your model. Finally, just for AI engineer attendees, we will soon be announcing a platform for building, managing, and deploying your personal AI software engineer.</p><p>Scan the QR code or sign up at waitlist.morph.so to get early access.
