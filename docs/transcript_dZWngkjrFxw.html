Everybody here, any human being in this area, in all the world, not against peace. Everybody likes life. Even Hamas in Gaza, they like life, they like peace. But peace is not like what you want. If I want to buy something from you, if I get it for your price, and I am happy for your things, I will buy it. So our situation here, what's going on with the Israelis, we are not against Israel as people, Jews. We are against occupation. If you remember what's happened with Russia and Ukraine, look, one year Russia, they have a problem. They are afraid from NATO come close to them. They are going inside Ukraine. All the world and all the army of the world against Russia. How come I am refugee in my land? Why I lost my house? Did I make something for Israel? Did Hitler was my cousin? Did I make anything for the Jews in the world? Me and my family and the Palestinians? Do you have hope for peace? My age is 50 years. I have seven kids. No hope. If I told I have hope, I am Jew. And if you want to say the truth, there is no justice in the world. If you are strong, everybody afraid from you. If you are not, everybody kill you. They make you like this by your foot. That's what's happened. There is no peace, my friend. If you want to see the peace, come to our camp where I live. You will cry. You will cry. You see our peace. What are the conditions like in the camp? My friend, they are waiting for water. Water, you know what's mean water? In Europe, the dog, he live in good condition. Dog, animals. How come a human being no have water? Water to drink. I asked you about anger. What about love? Do you have love in your heart? Well, I love everybody. Even the Jews. They kill us. They destroyed our houses. I'm not look to fight. I'm not look to kill. I am against violence. We love your kids to live in good condition. The Israeli side and the Palestinian. We are against violence. We don't want to see more blood. We want to destroy this world. You come to me, I come to you. That's it. That's my hope. Thank you, my brother. Thank you. That's pretty good. You are Spanish. How are you? Spanish. Hello, Colombia. I like Colombia. How are you? Hello, friends. I recently traveled to the West Bank and spoke with many Palestinian people there. From all walks of life. There was anger and there was hope. In their voice, in their eyes, in their stories. In ways that I probably can't express with words. But I wanted to begin to experience directly. Most conversations were offline, but a few were on camera. And I include those latter ones here in this video. I'm not a journalist, nor a documentary filmmaker. Just a fellow human being. Trying to understand the struggles and the beauty of other people. And I just sometimes may bring a camera along. So I ask for your forgiveness if I fall short of what I could have done with this opportunity. I work hard to improve. And I will do many more videos like these. I love you all. So I think a lot of people would be surprised to see a Palestinian who is a Christian. Yes. Is there a tension in that? Can you explain what it's like to be you? Yes. Actually, because I've been to America once when I was there. And I said that I'm Palestinian Christian. And they, "How come you are Palestinian Christians?" They don't know that in Palestine there are Christian people. Palestinian Christians have existed since Jesus was born in here. And the place that I live in it, it's 200 years old. And it was my grand-grandfather who lived in this. And my grandfather and my father and me in the same house. In this area, in Palestine especially, you can see Christians and Muslims together living side by side. And as neighbors. As we go to the universities together. We work together. We do everything together. What aspects of life has made difficult here because of the tension between Israel and Palestine? Yes. Actually, since Jesus was born, it was occupied by many. Till now, occupation after occupation. We passed Palestine through the Turkish, the British, Egyptian, Jordanian. And that was the last is the Israeli. So there's quite a bit of tension between the various religions here. Yes. What gives you hope for the future? That's right. Yes. Because, you know, Christianity, Muslims, and Judaism. And which means that all praise the Lord. This makes me feel very happy. Because I'm not a judge to judge the other religions. I'm just praying. And God will judge everyone as what he believes. But the most important thing between the three major religions is just to have most important to have love. First of all, how long have you lived here? My father was second generation. Refugee, I'm a third generation. My grandfather first, he lived in 1948. What does it mean to be a refugee? Refugee, that's a long story. You know, Palestinians, they became refugees in 1948. When, you know, they lost their homeland, they became refugees. A lot of them live in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and everywhere in Palestine. You know, Palestinians get divided to West Bank, Gaza, East Jerusalem, Jordan Valley. Do you have hope for peace in the region? Of course, I do have hope because nothing lasts forever. You know, you know what that means? Nothing lasts forever. We are not alone. We have a lot of people. We are not alone. We are not alone. We are not alone in the world. We are not alone.
