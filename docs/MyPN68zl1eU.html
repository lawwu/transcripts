It was a little bit of a mishmash and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=54" target="_blank">00:00:54.460</a></span> | <span class="t">people loved it. So I'm going to do that again today. And I'm going to try to do it once a month</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=59" target="_blank">00:00:59.540</a></span> | <span class="t">or as often as there are things to talk about. First, I'm going to talk about our recent spring</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=64" target="_blank">00:01:04.020</a></span> | <span class="t">break trip to Hawaii. There are a lot of lessons in here on travel, getting upgrades, saving. So I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=70" target="_blank">00:01:10.300</a></span> | <span class="t">it's gonna be really helpful for anyone, even if you're not planning on going to Hawaii or repeating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=74" target="_blank">00:01:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">this trip. For whatever reason, we didn't have any plans for spring break. I'm not sure this was only a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=78" target="_blank">00:01:18.980</a></span> | <span class="t">few months before we were leaving. And so we decided we wanted to try to do something. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=83" target="_blank">00:01:23.960</a></span> | <span class="t">we had so many options for how we could do the trip. We had lots of points and miles. But when it came to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=89" target="_blank">00:01:29.800</a></span> | <span class="t">where we were staying, we actually had a handful of Hilton free night certificates from Hilton cards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.720</a></span> | <span class="t">We had a bunch of Hyatt and Marriott points. We had this fractional home with Picasso that we could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=101" target="_blank">00:01:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">swap either through Picasso, or we actually have this third party network of vacation homes called</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.180</a></span> | <span class="t">third homes. And we had some keys there. And then we'd actually we've bought into exclusive resorts</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.920</a></span> | <span class="t">membership, which is like a private vacation rental club. And our initial idea was, let's find a place</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.620</a></span> | <span class="t">we can go that we're excited. But let's use the things that are expiring soon. So maybe those were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=124" target="_blank">00:02:04.280</a></span> | <span class="t">our third home keys or Picasso nights or Hilton certificates. And so we started with third home</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.620</a></span> | <span class="t">because we have the ability to book a really nice property anywhere in the world. But we have to book</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">it by May 23. That's when our all of our keys, their virtual currency expire. And we couldn't find</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=138" target="_blank">00:02:18.980</a></span> | <span class="t">anything for spring break. So if anyone's looking for a nice villa or a home, and you're really flexible</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.980</a></span> | <span class="t">on dates, take a look at what's on third home, shoot me an email, maybe we can make a deal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So we moved on. And we were like Hilton, Marriott, Hyatt, what should we do? And it was impossible,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">but not because it was hard to find availability. There was a lot of availability all over the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.460</a></span> | <span class="t">But it was impossible because there were just too many options. And it didn't feel like we were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.980</a></span> | <span class="t">choosing our vacation at all. So we did a hard reset. Amy and I sat down and said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">okay, it's spring break. We have two young girls. What do we want to do? Where do we want to go?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And the requirements we had were we just wanted a direct flight somewhere warm, where we had some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.460</a></span> | <span class="t">pools or beaches, because we just didn't want to be doing a bunch of city activities when we had to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.520</a></span> | <span class="t">come back for naps with young kids who, by the way, are really excited to swim all the time right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So we were like, it looks like the best options are Hawaii and Mexico. So now that we scoped it back</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.640</a></span> | <span class="t">really, really tight, it felt like it was a much more manageable search.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, because we have kids, we were looking for places that had room for four people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And yes, we could do one hotel room with two queen beds. But our kids throw their arms around at night,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.440</a></span> | <span class="t">no one can share a bed with one of them when they're sleeping. It's kind of a mess. And there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.900</a></span> | <span class="t">actually a whole episode coming out soon about kids and travel. But we were looking at our exclusive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.580</a></span> | <span class="t">resorts thing. And we found five nights at a three bedroom place at the montage in Kapalua Bay in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Maui. Now, we've never been to Maui with the kids. We've only been to Maui once ourselves had an amazing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.360</a></span> | <span class="t">time. It seemed like that was such a great option. And funny enough, we were like, well, we don't really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.740</a></span> | <span class="t">need three bedrooms. And I was talking to my parents and they said, Oh, like, who's gonna stay in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.040</a></span> | <span class="t">third bedroom. And you know, there's been a laughing joke about whether they invited themselves</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">or we invited them. But at this point, they were kind of excited to come with us. Girls were excited</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.900</a></span> | <span class="t">to be there. We thought if they were here, maybe we could slip away for dinner one night. And they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">could help with the kids. And so we thought, great, we could just go for five nights to Maui lined up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.780</a></span> | <span class="t">during the week of spring break. But right in the middle of all this, I heard Robert from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Milenomics talking about how his stay at the Four Seasons Lanai was literally everything you could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">ever want a nice hotel to be. And so I immediately checked it out and thought, you know, I've had</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.660</a></span> | <span class="t">some friends that have been to Lanai. They thought it was amazing. Maybe we should go. Four Seasons is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.520</a></span> | <span class="t">usually pretty out of our budget. You know, we can't use your points. You can't use your miles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.740</a></span> | <span class="t">There's not really a deal to be had. However, maybe that's not the full story. So we looked and it was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.740</a></span> | <span class="t">out of our normal price range. The initial price was about $1,400 a night, which depending on your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.220</a></span> | <span class="t">budget, maybe that's cheap. Maybe that's astronomical. But that price wasn't the full story. And I want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.100</a></span> | <span class="t">break it down because I think sometimes you could find a hotel and say, wow, that hotel is 800 bucks a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.920</a></span> | <span class="t">night. That's way better than this $1,400 a night room. But when you start to peel back all the things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.340</a></span> | <span class="t">that might come with that $1,400 a night room and the end cost you'll pay to stay there. In this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.700</a></span> | <span class="t">particular case, I think you're going to be very, very surprised. So first we were looking at booking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the hotel through the All The Hacks hotel upgrade program. Thanks to our partnership with Savanti,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.940</a></span> | <span class="t">we're able to offer anyone access to a ton of perks and benefits and upgrades at luxury hotels,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.860</a></span> | <span class="t">over 5,000 of them around the world. So if you go to hotels.allthehacks.com or find the link on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.300</a></span> | <span class="t">website, the password is perks. You can go and you can just search for any hotel. So for example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=348" target="_blank">00:05:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm searching right now and I see the Four Seasons Lanai. And the one thing I'll tell you as a way to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.200</a></span> | <span class="t">know how to use the site is there's a list of rooms and rates for each hotel. Make sure you click the full</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">description for any of those rooms. And if you're looking, it usually says refundable, breakfast</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=364" target="_blank">00:06:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">included, and then some phrase, it could be virtuoso, cadence preferred, inspirato, like there are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=370" target="_blank">00:06:10.740</a></span> | <span class="t">different rate codes that are our partners. And so those will dictate what benefits you get.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=375" target="_blank">00:06:15.620</a></span> | <span class="t">But usually the benefits are upgrade, early, late check-in, early check-in, late checkout. Most of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=382" target="_blank">00:06:22.200</a></span> | <span class="t">those are subject to availability, but sometimes for the right stay at the right dollar amount,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=386" target="_blank">00:06:26.140</a></span> | <span class="t">you can confirm them in advance. But it almost always also includes free breakfast and a property</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=391" target="_blank">00:06:31.060</a></span> | <span class="t">credit. And as you're scrolling through, you can see what it includes. It'll say free breakfast,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=395" target="_blank">00:06:35.500</a></span> | <span class="t">one spa credit available at this spa, or it'll say early check-in or $100 property credit or anything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.380</a></span> | <span class="t">like that. So in addition to all of that, because of the relationship a lot of travel agencies have,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=411" target="_blank">00:06:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">you even get usually an even higher upgrade likelihood than booking through something like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=416" target="_blank">00:06:56.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Amex, fine hotels and resorts. So for the Four Seasons Lanai, you know, it said upgrade was going to be a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=422" target="_blank">00:07:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">thing. And when you look through the description of the room type, it also said you're going to get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=428" target="_blank">00:07:08.060</a></span> | <span class="t">free continental breakfast for two guests, category upgrade spa credit. Now, sometimes if you look at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=434" target="_blank">00:07:14.700</a></span> | <span class="t">these rates, they say virtuoso, which is a travel conglomerate, you know, collection of hotels, you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=439" target="_blank">00:07:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">go to the virtuoso site and get even more details. The virtuoso site said daily breakfast, $45 per person,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=445" target="_blank">00:07:25.740</a></span> | <span class="t">up to two guests, $100 resort credit can be used anything, anywhere, and early check-in, late</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=451" target="_blank">00:07:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">checkout, and an upgrade. There was also another rate for Cadence, which is another travel group,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=457" target="_blank">00:07:37.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and it said daily breakfast for two, hotel credit, upgrade, free transportation, and then $100 credit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=463" target="_blank">00:07:43.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's basically the same thing. So if you could book either one, it doesn't really matter which one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=467" target="_blank">00:07:47.700</a></span> | <span class="t">you book. Rates are usually cancelable. So we ended up booking this, reached out to the hotel,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=472" target="_blank">00:07:52.720</a></span> | <span class="t">asked them about the upgrade. Sometimes you can do this in advance, and they will confirm your upgrade</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=478" target="_blank">00:07:58.680</a></span> | <span class="t">if there's enough availability. Maybe they'll wait till you check in. But definitely, if you're doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=483" target="_blank">00:08:03.020</a></span> | <span class="t">a booking here, and the value of the booking across your stay is in the, let's call it thousands of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=488" target="_blank">00:08:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">dollars for the stay, then reach out to us. And we'll try to do what we can to see if we can help you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=494" target="_blank">00:08:14.100</a></span> | <span class="t">secure an upgrade in advance. One trick here is the upgrade is often, you know, one, maybe two</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=501" target="_blank">00:08:21.580</a></span> | <span class="t">categories. So if you book the cheapest possible room, you might go from garden view to ocean view.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=507" target="_blank">00:08:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you were to book, you know, the oceanfront room, the only real thing above that might be a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=512" target="_blank">00:08:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">suite. And so a one category upgrade could be really, really lucrative. We ended up getting upgraded from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=517" target="_blank">00:08:37.700</a></span> | <span class="t">a garden view to an ocean view, which was a huge jump, right? That $1,400 room, if we had booked an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=522" target="_blank">00:08:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">ocean view was $2,300. We knew we were going to get at least a partial ocean view in advance. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=526" target="_blank">00:08:46.440</a></span> | <span class="t">then we found out, you know, when we checked in that we got an ocean view might have even been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=529" target="_blank">00:08:49.660</a></span> | <span class="t">actually, I think it was an oceanfront. I'm not sure because they didn't say oceanfront, but the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=534" target="_blank">00:08:54.200</a></span> | <span class="t">ocean was right there. But that's just one of the things that you can layer on to make this a better</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=538" target="_blank">00:08:58.280</a></span> | <span class="t">deal. The rest of them come with the specific property. And you have to look at the website of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=542" target="_blank">00:09:02.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the hotel to know this. But if you look at the Four Seasons Lanai website, you'll see that until</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=548" target="_blank">00:09:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">December 31st, 2026, all of the room bookings also include round trip flights from Honolulu</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=556" target="_blank">00:09:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to Lanai. And that's on a public airline that really feels a lot more like a private airline</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=561" target="_blank">00:09:21.220</a></span> | <span class="t">called Lanai Air. They have two different planes. I think one of them has six or eight passengers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=566" target="_blank">00:09:26.200</a></span> | <span class="t">One of them has more like 20. And it's a true VIP experience. And those flights are all included.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=572" target="_blank">00:09:32.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'll talk about the review of everything and that experience. But that was part of the stay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=577" target="_blank">00:09:37.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Then there's a bunch of packages on the Four Seasons website if you click offers. And one of them was the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=583" target="_blank">00:09:43.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Discover Lanai package. And so it's basically good from, I think it's the rest of this year and all of next</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=589" target="_blank">00:09:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">year except Christmas and New Year's. If you book a three-night minimum, you get an additional $200 a day</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=594" target="_blank">00:09:54.780</a></span> | <span class="t">credit or $400 a day if you're in a suite. So there's that credit. And then last, right now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=601" target="_blank">00:10:01.900</a></span> | <span class="t">one of the restaurants is closed. And they're doing a little bit of construction at the front of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=606" target="_blank">00:10:06.600</a></span> | <span class="t">hotel. Honestly, I'd be surprised if you even really noticed it audibly. You know, it's visually you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=613" target="_blank">00:10:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">see the entryway to the hotel outside as being redone, but it affected our stay in zero possible</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=618" target="_blank">00:10:18.600</a></span> | <span class="t">way. But until August 31st, 2025, they say to thank our guests for their understanding. Each guest will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=626" target="_blank">00:10:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">get a complimentary daily activity to enjoy the island. That includes horseback riding, hiking,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=630" target="_blank">00:10:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">target sports, aerial experiences at the adventure park. And they also have a separate restaurant they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=636" target="_blank">00:10:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">setting up where Malibu Farm, which is normally just lunch, is also doing dinner. So if you tally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=641" target="_blank">00:10:41.400</a></span> | <span class="t">everything up, we ended up getting free breakfast for two people every day, which was $132 credit that we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=647" target="_blank">00:10:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">could use. We got inner island flights that I would value at about $100 a person. Plus, we got $200 a day</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=653" target="_blank">00:10:53.620</a></span> | <span class="t">credit. Plus, we got $100 per stay credit from the All the Hacks Upgrade program. We got the upgrade,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=659" target="_blank">00:10:59.860</a></span> | <span class="t">which I'm not even going to include in this value. Plus, we got a free activity every day. So my daughter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=665" target="_blank">00:11:05.060</a></span> | <span class="t">got to go horseback riding one day. And then we went to the adventure park, which is kind of like a ropes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=669" target="_blank">00:11:09.300</a></span> | <span class="t">course one day. So when I added up all of those extras, the total price of the room was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=677" target="_blank">00:11:17.220</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot less. So all those extras divided by the number of nights was about $700 a night, which means</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=683" target="_blank">00:11:23.560</a></span> | <span class="t">that our $1,400 a night room included $700 a night of benefits. Now, maybe you don't value all these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=691" target="_blank">00:11:31.700</a></span> | <span class="t">benefits the same way we did. But we certainly spent all the credits, we would have done a few</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=695" target="_blank">00:11:35.940</a></span> | <span class="t">activities, we would have had to fly to the island, and we did our best to eat massive breakfasts. Though I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=701" target="_blank">00:11:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">will say, kids breakfasts were also included, and the kids could order whatever they want. I'm not even</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=706" target="_blank">00:11:46.380</a></span> | <span class="t">including that. So when you factor all that in, if it's really only $700 a night room, is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=711" target="_blank">00:11:51.240</a></span> | <span class="t">expensive? Yes. But is it a lot less expensive than $1,400? Also, yes. And so I thought overall,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=719" target="_blank">00:11:59.240</a></span> | <span class="t">it was an amazing deal. We booked it. And I will get to the review of it in a couple minutes. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=726" target="_blank">00:12:06.020</a></span> | <span class="t">preview, it was amazing. So once we booked our flights, we had three nights in Lanai, then we had,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=732" target="_blank">00:12:12.780</a></span> | <span class="t">we reduced the stay at the Montage to four nights. And then we were just going to take the ferry between</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=737" target="_blank">00:12:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the two. So, you know, we could fly from Honolulu to Lanai, take a short ferry, and then fly back home</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=743" target="_blank">00:12:23.640</a></span> | <span class="t">from the island of Maui. So now we kind of had the infrastructure of where now we had to get there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=748" target="_blank">00:12:28.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, flights seemed a little daunting at first, because it's spring break, we looked at the dates,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=755" target="_blank">00:12:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and it was pretty expensive, right? Each way to Hawaii, whether we were flying to Honolulu or Maui</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=761" target="_blank">00:12:41.560</a></span> | <span class="t">was like five, six, as much as seven or $800 for direct flights, which was not ideal. And certainly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=768" target="_blank">00:12:48.140</a></span> | <span class="t">not something when you're booking four seats that you're really excited about. So I looked at using</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=773" target="_blank">00:12:53.400</a></span> | <span class="t">points and miles, as I always do. And it turns out that some of those flights that were five,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=777" target="_blank">00:12:57.900</a></span> | <span class="t">$600, I could book on Hawaiian Air using Alaska points for just 26,500 points. So, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=785" target="_blank">00:13:05.640</a></span> | <span class="t">let's call that ballpark, you know, $300 of value, way, way better deal. So found that and book that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=791" target="_blank">00:13:11.780</a></span> | <span class="t">on the outbound. On the return, it was a little less easy. We did find that same price, 26,500 miles</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=797" target="_blank">00:13:17.980</a></span> | <span class="t">for flights that were normally $600 or $700. But it was only one stop. So we couldn't fly direct from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=804" target="_blank">00:13:24.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Maui to the Bay Area on any carrier on the day we wanted, even if we stayed an extra day without</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=811" target="_blank">00:13:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">spending $700 or $800. So that was off the table. So we looked, we said, okay, we could spend 26,500</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=817" target="_blank">00:13:37.140</a></span> | <span class="t">miles per person, fly through Honolulu, not the end of the world. But when I was doing this searching</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=823" target="_blank">00:13:43.060</a></span> | <span class="t">just for fun, and I don't know what made me think about it, I looked at searching from Honolulu home</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=829" target="_blank">00:13:49.340</a></span> | <span class="t">on the off chance that maybe there was an inter-island flight that was really cheap and we could get direct</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=834" target="_blank">00:13:54.420</a></span> | <span class="t">home cheaper. And it turns out there were four business class flights on that same Hawaiian air</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=839" target="_blank">00:13:59.200</a></span> | <span class="t">flight going home. But when I searched for Maui, there were only two. Now, this sometimes happens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=845" target="_blank">00:14:05.180</a></span> | <span class="t">It turns out the flights inter-island from Maui to Honolulu only have two seats for business class</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=851" target="_blank">00:14:11.560</a></span> | <span class="t">award space. But the larger flight from Honolulu back to Oakland had four seats in business that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=859" target="_blank">00:14:19.220</a></span> | <span class="t">you could book with points. So we ended up booking two flights, one on the like, let's call it the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=866" target="_blank">00:14:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">9am flight from Maui to Honolulu and one on the 945. So my wife and I were going to split with one kid</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=873" target="_blank">00:14:33.080</a></span> | <span class="t">each, fly to Honolulu separately. And then on the way from Honolulu back to the Bay Area, we'd all be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=878" target="_blank">00:14:38.440</a></span> | <span class="t">together. So that was the way we were able to get four business class seats for 40,000 points each.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=882" target="_blank">00:14:42.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And the limiting factor was just flying from Maui to Honolulu. Now on some airlines, you can just call</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=888" target="_blank">00:14:48.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and you could say, hey, could you just book us an economy for this leg? And no problem. But in this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=893" target="_blank">00:14:53.900</a></span> | <span class="t">particular case, we couldn't do that. Hawaiian and Alaska, whatever way their systems work, they didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=899" target="_blank">00:14:59.380</a></span> | <span class="t">allow that kind of mixed award booking. And so we had to book it separately. But if you find this scenario</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=904" target="_blank">00:15:04.760</a></span> | <span class="t">on other airlines, it is often possible to call them or even sometimes use the multi-city search</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=910" target="_blank">00:15:10.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and book a economy first leg connecting to a business class second leg.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=914" target="_blank">00:15:14.760</a></span> | <span class="t">This episode is brought to you by Gelt.

However, we did try a backup tactic. We booked a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1102" target="_blank">00:18:22.840</a></span> | <span class="t">separate flight using Southwest points for 26,000 points from Maui through Honolulu back to San Francisco,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1111" target="_blank">00:18:31.400</a></span> | <span class="t">but we would have much preferred to take one of those direct flights. But like I mentioned,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1114" target="_blank">00:18:34.600</a></span> | <span class="t">they were $800. However, I did have one idea, and that's based on the same day change rules of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1120" target="_blank">00:18:40.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Southwest. So Southwest had plenty of seats on the direct Maui to Oakland flight, and we would love</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1126" target="_blank">00:18:46.120</a></span> | <span class="t">to have taken it, but at $800, it just didn't seem worth it. I'd rather fly through Honolulu in business</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1131" target="_blank">00:18:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">class for 40,000 points than pay $800 to fly direct. However, there was a Southwest flight from Maui through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1138" target="_blank">00:18:58.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Honolulu back to Oakland with terrible times and layovers, but it was only 26,000 Southwest points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1146" target="_blank">00:19:06.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So I booked us on that with the goal of checking at midnight on the day of departure whether that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1152" target="_blank">00:19:12.600</a></span> | <span class="t">space was still available on the direct flight.

And so that was the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1179" target="_blank">00:19:39.320</a></span> | <span class="t">plan going in. So let's talk about the experience. About three, four, five days, I can't remember</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1184" target="_blank">00:19:44.280</a></span> | <span class="t">exactly before, I got an email from Hawaiian that said, "Hey, do you want to bid on an upgrade from the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1190" target="_blank">00:19:50.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Bay Area over to Hawaii?" And I thought, "Oh, I wonder how much do you have to bid, right? Like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1194" target="_blank">00:19:54.520</a></span> | <span class="t">there's some price at which I'd pay for that upgrade." And I looked in, and there was no way</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1198" target="_blank">00:19:58.520</a></span> | <span class="t">to bid any less than $325. And I thought, "Gosh, if they're looking for us to bid, there must be a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1203" target="_blank">00:20:03.560</a></span> | <span class="t">of seats." And I looked, and there were four seats available in business. So I went on and said, "Were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1208" target="_blank">00:20:08.920</a></span> | <span class="t">there available in miles?" And two of them were. So it was a bit of a dice roll here, because you never</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1215" target="_blank">00:20:15.640</a></span> | <span class="t">know what will happen. So I thought, "What if I book two of those seats in business and hope that those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1221" target="_blank">00:20:21.960</a></span> | <span class="t">other two seats show up and I can book them before the day of departure?" Because at the end of the day,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1227" target="_blank">00:20:27.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the difference between 26,500 points and 40,000 points was way less than paying $325 for an upgrade.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1235" target="_blank">00:20:35.080</a></span> | <span class="t">We didn't really need the upgrade. And normally we don't like to separate on the flight. However,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1241" target="_blank">00:20:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">we did have our youngest, and we did have a hypothesis that she might nap better on a lie</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1246" target="_blank">00:20:46.040</a></span> | <span class="t">flat in business. And I personally had never flown Hawaiian in business. So I thought, "Get to experience</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1252" target="_blank">00:20:52.760</a></span> | <span class="t">it. Daughter might get some sleep. Only an extra 13,500 miles a person for two of us." So unfortunately,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1261" target="_blank">00:21:01.640</a></span> | <span class="t">those other two seats never did open up. So it was just me and one daughter. I did offer my wife to take</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1267" target="_blank">00:21:07.880</a></span> | <span class="t">it. But she said, "I would rather you take our youngest and deal with her trying to nap on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1273" target="_blank">00:21:13.400</a></span> | <span class="t">plane. And I'll stay back here with our other daughter." So I'll speak to the business class</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1278" target="_blank">00:21:18.840</a></span> | <span class="t">experience. But you know, wife said the coach experience was also great. So business class,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1283" target="_blank">00:21:23.720</a></span> | <span class="t">great food. I wouldn't say it was anything to write home about, but good options. There were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1289" target="_blank">00:21:29.080</a></span> | <span class="t">not a lot of amenities for a, what was a daytime flight. You know, I didn't lie down to go to sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1294" target="_blank">00:21:34.120</a></span> | <span class="t">But I did notice that in coach, they were serving actual meals. You get a full, I think it was a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1298" target="_blank">00:21:38.120</a></span> | <span class="t">breakfast sandwich. So that was nice. I feel like a lot of times, you know, if we were on the Southwest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1303" target="_blank">00:21:43.640</a></span> | <span class="t">flight, we might've gotten a few snacks, but we wouldn't have gotten a real, real kind of meal sized</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1309" target="_blank">00:21:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">thing. So that was great. But the real highlight of the entire flight was Starlink. This was my first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1316" target="_blank">00:21:56.120</a></span> | <span class="t">flight on an airline that has Starlink. And I cannot explain how incredible it is. It seems so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1324" target="_blank">00:22:04.840</a></span> | <span class="t">unnecessary and not that exciting to have Starlink on a plane, right? Like it doesn't seem like it would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1331" target="_blank">00:22:11.720</a></span> | <span class="t">change your experience, but it literally just felt like you could actually work as if you were at home,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1338" target="_blank">00:22:18.200</a></span> | <span class="t">work as if you were in a high speed internet anywhere. And I was so productive. And about a week before,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1344" target="_blank">00:22:24.840</a></span> | <span class="t">a friend of mine told me he actually opted to change planes on the way home from Hawaii,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1349" target="_blank">00:22:29.560</a></span> | <span class="t">so he could have Starlink. And at the time I was like, that's crazy. I would fly direct over changing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1354" target="_blank">00:22:34.760</a></span> | <span class="t">planes every day of the week. And now I'm like, if I had no children with me, I would definitely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1361" target="_blank">00:22:41.080</a></span> | <span class="t">consider changing planes for a long flight for the quality of the productive work I would get done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1367" target="_blank">00:22:47.400</a></span> | <span class="t">With kids, I think it's a different story. But I'm just, I'm so excited for the day when Starlink is on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1373" target="_blank">00:22:53.320</a></span> | <span class="t">all the planes. I know United's announced it's coming. It's going to be incredible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1377" target="_blank">00:22:57.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So land in Honolulu. Right as we land, we got a text from Lanai Air from someone saying, we're ready</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1385" target="_blank">00:23:05.800</a></span> | <span class="t">to meet you by baggage claim. We're ready to help you move your bags over to a private car. We got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1390" target="_blank">00:23:10.840</a></span> | <span class="t">in a town car. It was actually a suburban, drove us over to the private terminal and waited for maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1396" target="_blank">00:23:16.600</a></span> | <span class="t">one hour. We actually landed early and our Lanai Air flight was about two hours later and they were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1402" target="_blank">00:23:22.360</a></span> | <span class="t">able to move us to get on an earlier flight an hour earlier. And it really does feel like you're flying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1407" target="_blank">00:23:27.800</a></span> | <span class="t">private. I will say, unfortunately, they have these six passenger planes that look like they are truly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1413" target="_blank">00:23:33.960</a></span> | <span class="t">private that I thought would have been a fun experience. But would I rather have gotten to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1418" target="_blank">00:23:38.600</a></span> | <span class="t">hotel earlier and gotten on the 19 passenger, I think, flight that was leaving earlier? Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1424" target="_blank">00:23:44.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the only thing that felt a little less private like was the fact that it was a larger</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1429" target="_blank">00:23:49.640</a></span> | <span class="t">plane with more people. But you know, you get to the plane riding on a golf cart out to the tarmac.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1435" target="_blank">00:23:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It just was such a amazing experience to be included in the cost of your hotel room. So really, really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1442" target="_blank">00:24:02.440</a></span> | <span class="t">awesome. Obviously, no real service on the flight. It wasn't very long. I think, you know, maybe 30</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1448" target="_blank">00:24:08.840</a></span> | <span class="t">minutes landed, got picked up by the hotel and and headed off to the resort. For anyone not familiar,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1456" target="_blank">00:24:16.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Lanai is a very interesting island. It's about 140 square miles, about three or 4,000 people. But the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1464" target="_blank">00:24:24.120</a></span> | <span class="t">most interesting thing is that it is almost entirely owned by Larry Ellison, who founded Oracle. He owns</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1470" target="_blank">00:24:30.200</a></span> | <span class="t">about 98% of the island. It used to be a pineapple plantation, almost the entire island. And the family or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1475" target="_blank">00:24:35.880</a></span> | <span class="t">company that owned it, when the pineapple plantation shut down, they had to find a new owner, and he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1480" target="_blank">00:24:40.600</a></span> | <span class="t">bought the island effectively. He doesn't own 2% of it, which is kind of the downtown Lanai city where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1485" target="_blank">00:24:45.960</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of people live. There's two main hotels, there are two Four Seasons hotels, and there's one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1491" target="_blank">00:24:51.800</a></span> | <span class="t">smaller hotel downtown. One of the Four Seasons, we didn't experience it at all, is called Sensei,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1497" target="_blank">00:24:57.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and it's adults only. It's more in the middle, is a much more wellness-focused resort. It looks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1503" target="_blank">00:25:03.080</a></span> | <span class="t">amazing, but it's adults only, and we had our children, so it wasn't really a thing we were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1506" target="_blank">00:25:06.840</a></span> | <span class="t">going to experience. And as soon as we got to the resort, it was about a 20-minute drive. From that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1514" target="_blank">00:25:14.200</a></span> | <span class="t">point forward, it was everything you could ever want in a hotel. The staff was incredible. The room was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1521" target="_blank">00:25:21.080</a></span> | <span class="t">incredible.

I can't even explain how great it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1544" target="_blank">00:25:44.360</a></span> | <span class="t">was.

Every place you went</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1558" target="_blank">00:25:58.120</a></span> | <span class="t">had coloring mats and stuff. It was dialed in for kids, but it was so relaxing for adults. I think my wife</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1566" target="_blank">00:26:06.360</a></span> | <span class="t">said somehow they managed to like make an adult and kid experience magical for both sets. And it was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1573" target="_blank">00:26:13.800</a></span> | <span class="t">just, I haven't experienced that before.

We had an amazing time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1719" target="_blank">00:28:39.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I just can't say more about how great the property was shout out to the entire staff there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1723" target="_blank">00:28:43.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And this was not a comp to visit. We paid for this visit, uh, out of our pocket. So, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1729" target="_blank">00:28:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I wish it was, if anyone listening wants to comp our visit anytime we'd love to go back, but, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1733" target="_blank">00:28:53.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I think we would even pay for the trip again.

We grabbed a snack, hopped in a lift and went up to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1761" target="_blank">00:29:21.320</a></span> | <span class="t">the montage and also incredible property. This was a little bit of a different experience, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1767" target="_blank">00:29:27.720</a></span> | <span class="t">This time, one, my parents were already there. They got there about an hour before us and met us there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1771" target="_blank">00:29:31.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was a three bedroom condo at a resort property. And there's something interesting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1776" target="_blank">00:29:36.600</a></span> | <span class="t">about the montage in Maui is that my understanding is it used to be the Ritz vacation club. I didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1782" target="_blank">00:29:42.120</a></span> | <span class="t">fact check this, so I could be wrong, but because of that, it was historically a place where most</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1788" target="_blank">00:29:48.280</a></span> | <span class="t">people staying there were owners and a lot of the condos have kitchens. And so it kind of was missing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1795" target="_blank">00:29:55.320</a></span> | <span class="t">some of the kind of restaurant options you would see at a big resort like this. I think there's just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1800" target="_blank">00:30:00.280</a></span> | <span class="t">one restaurant and poolside dining. And so we did go to the restaurant one night. It was great. It was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1806" target="_blank">00:30:06.600</a></span> | <span class="t">expensive, like you would expect, but it was good food. The rooms were excellent. So we had this three</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1810" target="_blank">00:30:10.600</a></span> | <span class="t">bedroom place with ocean view. I love how at least exclusive resorts, I don't know if their villas are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1816" target="_blank">00:30:16.680</a></span> | <span class="t">different than others, but you know, every room has a Sonos, they have a full kitchen, they have laundry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1822" target="_blank">00:30:22.600</a></span> | <span class="t">It just was really dialed in. But because it was on the resort, you could still order room service if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1827" target="_blank">00:30:27.720</a></span> | <span class="t">needed to. You still had daily house cleaning. And so that was awesome. The experience of being</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1833" target="_blank">00:30:33.160</a></span> | <span class="t">able to have multiple bedrooms with kids and in our case with my parents, but also be at a resort where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1838" target="_blank">00:30:38.120</a></span> | <span class="t">you can just walk very close to massive pools and lounge chairs and get poolside service was really,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1844" target="_blank">00:30:44.360</a></span> | <span class="t">really great. The pools are awesome at the montage in Maui. I want to say there's four tiers of pools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1851" target="_blank">00:30:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's like the adult pool and then three tiers of kids pools with little waterfalls between them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1855" target="_blank">00:30:55.960</a></span> | <span class="t">with rocks that kids can jump off of, weird little water features and multiple hot tubs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1861" target="_blank">00:31:01.480</a></span> | <span class="t">shallow section for younger kids. It was definitely more of a family vibe than some hotels I've stayed at,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1869" target="_blank">00:31:09.160</a></span> | <span class="t">but we were there with our kids. So that was exactly what we were looking for. And this was also true at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1873" target="_blank">00:31:13.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the four seasons. But you never felt like there weren't chairs. At the montage, they told us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1878" target="_blank">00:31:18.120</a></span> | <span class="t">explicitly they had this policy. You could go down seven o'clock, you could sit in chairs. And if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1882" target="_blank">00:31:22.840</a></span> | <span class="t">don't use them by nine o'clock, you lose them. So I appreciated that they had a policy that was stated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1887" target="_blank">00:31:27.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So but because there were not so many people there when we were there, at least they had enough chairs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1894" target="_blank">00:31:34.680</a></span> | <span class="t">for people never felt like it was too crowded.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1897" target="_blank">00:31:37.400</a></span> | <span class="t">There were some cool other things to do. So I'd highly recommend if you go to the montage, there are these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1903" target="_blank">00:31:43.400</a></span> | <span class="t">tide pools that you can walk to not very far of a hike. And it was really awesome. It was like a little rock</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1909" target="_blank">00:31:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">scrambling down to some tide pools. That was great. The beach is right next to the property. All the beaches in Hawaii</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1915" target="_blank">00:31:55.640</a></span> | <span class="t">for anyone who hasn't been are public. So they don't operate quite the same as some of the beaches you might have been to at a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1921" target="_blank">00:32:01.560</a></span> | <span class="t">resort in Mexico, where the resort is kind of really operating the beach. And so in this case, I think the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1928" target="_blank">00:32:08.280</a></span> | <span class="t">montage, you could check in at the beach shack and you would get, you know, two chairs and an umbrella free for staying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1934" target="_blank">00:32:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">at the hotel. But they also had a place where you could rent snorkel gear and paddle boards or even wetsuits if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1940" target="_blank">00:32:20.760</a></span> | <span class="t">wanted them. Our girls do not love the ocean and are a little bit shy when it comes to big waves. However, in this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1949" target="_blank">00:32:29.880</a></span> | <span class="t">particular case, the waves were pretty calm here. The waves in Lanai were a little bit bigger. The waves</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1955" target="_blank">00:32:35.720</a></span> | <span class="t">in the montage were calm enough that we actually got our girls out a bit, but not nearly enough to go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1960" target="_blank">00:32:40.760</a></span> | <span class="t">snorkeling. It looks like there was some awesome snorkeling. Didn't get to do it on this trip. Hopefully,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1966" target="_blank">00:32:46.760</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe next time girls are more excited. The other cool thing about this location</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1970" target="_blank">00:32:50.600</a></span> | <span class="t">location is there's a restaurant called Merriman's. It's pretty well known. I think they have multiple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1975" target="_blank">00:32:55.960</a></span> | <span class="t">locations on different Hawaiian islands and excellent restaurant.

And if you walk a little bit further, there are a few other restaurants. And so really nice</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1988" target="_blank">00:33:08.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that you could walk to a great restaurant. Now, Merriman's is also so popular that it's very hard to get a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1993" target="_blank">00:33:13.740</a></span> | <span class="t">reservation. And we did not plan in advance and it's quite expensive, but they actually have an outdoor</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=1998" target="_blank">00:33:18.620</a></span> | <span class="t">part of the restaurant called On The Point, which is no reservations, walk-in only, and honestly, I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2004" target="_blank">00:33:24.760</a></span> | <span class="t">better views because you're out right on the water.

If you wanted to order some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2148" target="_blank">00:35:48.500</a></span> | <span class="t">lunch at the pool, it might take 20, 30 minutes for someone to stop by and another 30 or 40 minutes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2153" target="_blank">00:35:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">for your food to come.

Set my alarm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2169" target="_blank">00:36:09.260</a></span> | <span class="t">for 12am, wake up and quickly go look for is that Southwest flight still available? Can I switch? I could. So I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2177" target="_blank">00:36:17.500</a></span> | <span class="t">immediately switched all four seats. We're now on a direct flight back. That $800 flight we ended up getting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2182" target="_blank">00:36:22.820</a></span> | <span class="t">for 26,000 Southwest points, which is about, you know, three ish hundred dollars. So amazing savings. And then we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2189" target="_blank">00:36:29.620</a></span> | <span class="t">canceled our Hawaiian flights, because Alaska lets you cancel up to honestly, up until the time of boarding. And we got all those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2198" target="_blank">00:36:38.120</a></span> | <span class="t">points back. So to whoever was flying home on Hawaiian and thought they had no chance at an upgrade,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2202" target="_blank">00:36:42.860</a></span> | <span class="t">um, you know, morning of, we opened up four business class seats. So hopefully four people got really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2208" target="_blank">00:36:48.260</a></span> | <span class="t">lucky that day. That said, I would have loved to fly on that Hawaiian flight direct. The Hawaiian experience</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2214" target="_blank">00:36:54.020</a></span> | <span class="t">was fantastic. Everything, the flight attendants were amazing. Um, really big fan of Hawaiian, excited that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2219" target="_blank">00:36:59.740</a></span> | <span class="t">they're partnering with Alaska, excited that I now have a ton of Alaska points, uh, actually transferred in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2226" target="_blank">00:37:06.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the max, which was, I think either 990 or 999,000 Amex points. So I took a huge chunk of my Amex points</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2234" target="_blank">00:37:14.820</a></span> | <span class="t">and moved them all over to Alaska, primarily because we were booking this trip to Hawaii and we booked a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2241" target="_blank">00:37:21.160</a></span> | <span class="t">trip to Europe, um, for the summer that we may end up needing to cancel, but really flexible cancellation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2248" target="_blank">00:37:28.340</a></span> | <span class="t">policies. And so many partners, we've been really able to find a lot of opportunities to use Alaska points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2254" target="_blank">00:37:34.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So honestly, if we end up keeping the summer trip, I might move some more in the rumor is that a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2262" target="_blank">00:37:42.500</a></span> | <span class="t">of the things happening with Hawaiian and Alaska are going to be finalized after June 30th. So my guess,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2269" target="_blank">00:37:49.260</a></span> | <span class="t">and I have no inside information is that that Amex to Hawaiian transfer partner will probably end by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2276" target="_blank">00:37:56.020</a></span> | <span class="t">June 30th. That said, if you want to transfer points into Alaska, I would do it now. I wouldn't wait.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2281" target="_blank">00:38:01.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, I, I, I don't know how long it will last, but I do know that it will be gone at some point. And I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2287" target="_blank">00:38:07.020</a></span> | <span class="t">don't anticipate Alaska being a, uh, Amex transfer partner. So if you're interested in Alaska points,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2293" target="_blank">00:38:13.460</a></span> | <span class="t">I would do that. A few other ways to get them are, of course you get Alaska cards. There are two Hawaiian</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2298" target="_blank">00:38:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">credit cards right now with 60 to I think 75,000 point signup bonuses. Those are probably eventually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2304" target="_blank">00:38:24.620</a></span> | <span class="t">going to go away. They're issued by, uh, Barclays, but you can still get them now. So there's a way to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2310" target="_blank">00:38:30.780</a></span> | <span class="t">add a few extra Alaska points. If you want, they have pretty good earning relative to the minimum</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2316" target="_blank">00:38:36.100</a></span> | <span class="t">spend. And if you hold a Hawaiian card, you can actually transfer points between any other person</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2324" target="_blank">00:38:44.620</a></span> | <span class="t">for free. So honestly, I want one of them, either me or Amy to have just because we have a ton of Alaska</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2330" target="_blank">00:38:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">points in each of our accounts. I'd love to be able to move them freely between each other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2334" target="_blank">00:38:54.600</a></span> | <span class="t">There's also an Alaska premium card coming soon. My guess is it will probably launch around the same</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2340" target="_blank">00:39:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">time. They kick off all of the finalization of these mergers. So that was our trip to Hawaii.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2345" target="_blank">00:39:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I know that was a lot, but I think there are some tactics in there and some perspective in there and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2350" target="_blank">00:39:10.700</a></span> | <span class="t">some suggestions in there for, uh, that are super valuable. And I hope you agree next. I have a bunch</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2355" target="_blank">00:39:15.940</a></span> | <span class="t">of things to run through. So I'm just going to get through it. So first, um, a couple of weeks ago,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2359" target="_blank">00:39:19.820</a></span> | <span class="t">there was an episode on lounges and accessing them. Two things that people sent in that I didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2364" target="_blank">00:39:24.920</a></span> | <span class="t">mention. One, there is a card that you can't get directly called the Ritz Carlton card from Chase.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2372" target="_blank">00:39:32.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you do have one of the Bonvoy cards from Chase, you can change to it after a year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2377" target="_blank">00:39:37.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reason I brought it up now is that people reminded me that it gets free authorized users</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2383" target="_blank">00:39:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and every card holder has unlimited guests on priority pass. So that is a really cool lounge</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2388" target="_blank">00:39:48.860</a></span> | <span class="t">card we didn't talk about. And then the next thing is, I hope this isn't a trend, but it looks like a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2395" target="_blank">00:39:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">few of the priority pass lounges are starting to charge a fee on top of, you know, just having the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2401" target="_blank">00:40:01.300</a></span> | <span class="t">priority pass membership. I think the first one was the Virgin lounge at LAX, but I just hope that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2407" target="_blank">00:40:07.460</a></span> | <span class="t">not a trend. So that's a quick little follow up to the lounge episode. Next, um, big shout out to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2411" target="_blank">00:40:11.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Patrick, who heard me talking about VPNs and flights and wanted to put it to the test.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2417" target="_blank">00:40:17.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And I've often heard that using a VPN can be helpful for international flights, but he was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2422" target="_blank">00:40:22.520</a></span> | <span class="t">actually testing it domestically. And so he was looking for a nonstop flight from Washington, DC to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2427" target="_blank">00:40:27.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Houston, Texas. And he pulled up a VPN for each city, ran it once on in DC, ran it once in Texas,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2435" target="_blank">00:40:35.100</a></span> | <span class="t">and actually found that a United flight was about $30 cheaper booking it in Houston, the destination</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2443" target="_blank">00:40:43.560</a></span> | <span class="t">city than it was booking it in DC. Now he ran the search a few times for other cities and couldn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2448" target="_blank">00:40:48.760</a></span> | <span class="t">always replicate it. But really interesting that even sometimes domestic flights are priced differently</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2455" target="_blank">00:40:55.400</a></span> | <span class="t">based on where you are. So if you do have a VPN, um, I would suggest if you're about to buy a flight,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2461" target="_blank">00:41:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">at least quickly check whether that flight is cheaper, maybe open up an incognito window,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2466" target="_blank">00:41:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">check Google flights. If it is maybe worth buying, if it's not, you know, proceed as normal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2470" target="_blank">00:41:10.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, on the VPN front, uh, we don't have any sponsors that are VPNs, but, uh, we did in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2476" target="_blank">00:41:16.340</a></span> | <span class="t">past have Nord VPN. It's the VPN I use for things like this. I tried to get them to be a sponsor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2482" target="_blank">00:41:22.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Sounds like it wasn't, uh, it didn't perform as well for them as I had hoped. I still use it and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2487" target="_blank">00:41:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">pay for it myself. So if you need a suggestion, that's it. And I think there might be a deal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2491" target="_blank">00:41:31.040</a></span> | <span class="t">still that works from that. I'll put it in the show notes. So that was one thing. And then the other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2495" target="_blank">00:41:35.880</a></span> | <span class="t">thing was there's an article and I'll link to it where people found that searching for award inventory</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2501" target="_blank">00:41:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">on United in some areas, you actually saw more award tickets at lower prices in different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2509" target="_blank">00:41:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">countries. So if you go to the top of the site and say, I'm not in the U S speaking English, I'm in,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2513" target="_blank">00:41:53.780</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, France or Vietnam speaking English, you would actually see flights that weren't available</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2518" target="_blank">00:41:58.100</a></span> | <span class="t">on the U S site. I hope that's just a glitch, but maybe read the comments of the post. I'll include,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2524" target="_blank">00:42:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">but it's just goes to show that you never know what kinds of variables you tweak and you might</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2529" target="_blank">00:42:09.340</a></span> | <span class="t">end up finding better deals. So am I going to try that tip on United every time I search for flights?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2534" target="_blank">00:42:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Probably not.

Okay, next, Amex. Speaking of being on sites, I was on the Amex</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2707" target="_blank">00:45:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">site logged in, and I was looking at the Hilton cards. And I noticed that we'd currently downgraded</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2713" target="_blank">00:45:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">our Hilton Aspire card to a Surpass card. And there was some language saying, "Hey, do you want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2717" target="_blank">00:45:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to upgrade?" And similarly, we had another upgrade offer to go from the Amex Business Gold to the Amex</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2723" target="_blank">00:45:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Business Platinum. So one, make sure you're checking on the Amex site just to see if those offers exist when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2729" target="_blank">00:45:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">you're logged in. If not, you can also call in and ask. But we ended up getting a bonus for both upgrades.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2735" target="_blank">00:45:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So on the Amex Business Gold and the Amex Business Platinum, we got 120,000 Amex points after 10k</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2743" target="_blank">00:45:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">spend. And that's just on an upgrade. We didn't have to open a new card. And then on the Surpass to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2748" target="_blank">00:45:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Aspire, we were just doing that so that we got back to the Aspire to have diamond status on Hilton.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2754" target="_blank">00:45:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">We didn't even think there was an offer, except we did that. And we recently put some spend on that card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2761" target="_blank">00:46:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And all of a sudden, we ended up getting another Hilton free night certificate that was labeled</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2765" target="_blank">00:46:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">as the Amex upgrade certificate. So we didn't even know we were getting a bonus and we did.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2770" target="_blank">00:46:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So I would say recommendation to anyone, definitely with Amex.

So it's probably only within Bonvoy, only within</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2786" target="_blank">00:46:26.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Delta, only within Hilton, or within Amex's cards themselves. But definitely, if you're trying to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2791" target="_blank">00:46:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">change, see if there are any deals and they can be lucrative. A few other changes in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2796" target="_blank">00:46:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">airline points and miles world. So one, something weird is going on with Emirates.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2801" target="_blank">00:46:41.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Citi just recently said that transfers from Citi to Emirates are going down. Instead of transferring</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2808" target="_blank">00:46:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">one to one, you're going to get one to 0.8. So that's a bummer. I don't often use Emirates to book anything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2815" target="_blank">00:46:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">If I, in fact, I've never done it, but a few days later, Chase and Amex said from the end of May to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2820" target="_blank">00:47:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the end of June, transfers to Emirates won't even work. So I don't think anyone knows what's going on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2826" target="_blank">00:47:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">with Emirates and their award program, but something seems to be happening. And so expect some changes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2832" target="_blank">00:47:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">hopefully not bad, but the city change makes me think that it's probably not a good change.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2838" target="_blank">00:47:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, next, uh, there's some rumors that JetBlue has announced some big partnerships coming up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2844" target="_blank">00:47:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, rumors seem to be that it's going to be some kind of partnership with United by the time this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2849" target="_blank">00:47:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">episode comes out. Maybe that news is there, but, uh, that seems to be something coming. And then if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2854" target="_blank">00:47:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">use the point.me award search tool, they finally added alerts.

If this Maui to, you know, the Bay area flight opens up, it didn't, but I definitely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2874" target="_blank">00:47:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">set those alerts up. So love setting up alerts. And if you're already a subscriber to point me,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2878" target="_blank">00:47:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">um, they have alerts. The other big change in the points and miles world, we kind of knew this was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2883" target="_blank">00:48:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">coming, but a lot more details were shared about what's going on with Southwest and all the new changes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2889" target="_blank">00:48:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">coming because it's going to be a totally different experience. So starting May 28th,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2894" target="_blank">00:48:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">any new reservations, or if you have an existing reservation and you change it after May 28th,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2898" target="_blank">00:48:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">you're no longer going to have free check bags unless you're business extra. They're also launching</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2903" target="_blank">00:48:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">on that same day, the basic fair, which is effectively the want to get away fair rebranded,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2909" target="_blank">00:48:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">but you're no longer going to be able to make any changes or earn more than two X points on those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2914" target="_blank">00:48:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">fairs. So they're kind of adding their basic economy. They are not changing the cancel fees.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2918" target="_blank">00:48:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So even with that basic fare, you'll be able to cancel for a flight credit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2922" target="_blank">00:48:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">But remember Southwest flight credits now will be expiring within, I think a year. So that also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2929" target="_blank">00:48:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">sucks. So a lot of the things that we all maybe loved about Southwest are disappearing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2933" target="_blank">00:48:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">The other big changes they say are coming in Q3, but haven't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2938" target="_blank">00:48:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think flights starting in 2026 are going to have this whole different seating layout.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2946" target="_blank">00:49:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And so typically, if you've been on Southwest ever, you know that all the seats are kind of the same,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2950" target="_blank">00:49:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">except except exit rows. Starting next year, the first five rows in the front are going to be extra</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2956" target="_blank">00:49:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">leg room, as well as three rows around the exit row. And then everything between the extra leg room in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2962" target="_blank">00:49:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the front and the exit row is going to be preferred seats that are really the same as the rest of the plane,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2967" target="_blank">00:49:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">just in the front of the plane. And then everything behind the exit rows are standard seats.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2971" target="_blank">00:49:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you're going to have to, you know, pick those seats or pay for those seats or get them based on your fair class.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2978" target="_blank">00:49:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And, and so that's something that's coming. And so those, those preferred seats in the front</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2983" target="_blank">00:49:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">and those extra leg room seats, it looks like are going to be about five extra inches of leg room.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2987" target="_blank">00:49:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So kind of compared to main cabin extra or economy plus, they're going to be able to start booking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2992" target="_blank">00:49:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">flights where you're going to need those assigned seats in Q3 for flights beginning in 2026 in Q1.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=2999" target="_blank">00:49:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">A couple of the changes as far as who's going to be able to book them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3002" target="_blank">00:50:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, there are now the same four classes of service as always, except they're renaming all of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3008" target="_blank">00:50:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So want to get away becomes basic want to get away plus becomes choice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3012" target="_blank">00:50:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Anytime becomes choice preferred and business select becomes choice extra.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3016" target="_blank">00:50:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And depending on which one you book affects what kind of seats you can choose.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3019" target="_blank">00:50:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you choose basic, you only get standard and you don't get it till you check in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3023" target="_blank">00:50:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">If you book choice, you get standard and you can select it a booking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3026" target="_blank">00:50:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">If you choose choice preferred, you get a preferred seat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3029" target="_blank">00:50:29.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you choose choice extra, you get the extra leg room.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3032" target="_blank">00:50:32.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, you also don't get any checked bags unless you book that choice extra.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3037" target="_blank">00:50:37.500</a></span> | <span class="t">However, there are still two other ways to get free bags and even some free seating options.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3043" target="_blank">00:50:43.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and that's by either having status or by being a Southwest card holder.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3049" target="_blank">00:50:49.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you have a list, which is their base status, you get one bag free and you can select a standard</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3055" target="_blank">00:50:55.580</a></span> | <span class="t">or premium seat at booking on any of the fair classes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3058" target="_blank">00:50:58.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And then 48 hours out, you can pick an extra leg room seat if it's there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3061" target="_blank">00:51:01.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And then if you're a list preferred, you get two bags and you can pick any seat regardless</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3106" target="_blank">00:51:46.740</a></span> | <span class="t">But the short version is if you have a card or you have status, you still get a free checked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3111" target="_blank">00:51:51.540</a></span> | <span class="t">bag.</span></div><div

still.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3139" target="_blank">00:52:19.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So another pretty interesting

you have the Built Rewards card, which I do and I love, you can earn points for paying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3149"

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3158" target="_blank">00:52:38.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So anyone that has rent, I highly recommend the Built card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3161" target="_blank">00:52:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just if you're paying that rent, you might as well be earning points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3164" target="_blank">00:52:44.760</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:52:52.500</a></span> | <span class="t">But you don't actually need the Built card to use Built points program.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3175" target="_blank">00:52:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, you can join Built Rewards for free and start earning points through all the various</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3180" target="_blank">00:53:00.180</a></span> | <span class="t">other things they do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3180" target="_blank">00:53:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">They partner with tons of restaurants.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3183" target="_blank">00:53:03.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's a bunch of great restaurants in the Bay Area and I'm sure in almost every city</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3187" target="_blank">00:53:07.460</a></span> | <span class="t">where when you dine out at that restaurant using any credit card you have, you can end up earning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3192" target="_blank">00:53:12.380</a></span> | <span class="t">any plus 2, plus 3, plus 4 Built points on top of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3196" target="_blank">00:53:16.700</a></span> | <span class="t">They have a bunch of partnerships with places like SoulCycle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3200" target="_blank">00:53:20.180</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3203" target="_blank">00:53:23.740</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, if you refer someone who opens up a Built card, you get Built points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3208" target="_blank">00:53:28.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So there are a lot of reasons to join the Built Rewards program and I think it's pretty reasonable</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3213" target="_blank">00:53:33.560</a></span> | <span class="t">to rack up Built points without even having the Built card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3216" target="_blank">00:53:36.020</a></span> | <span class="t">But they've just launched another way to do it and that is paying rent not through the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3221" target="_blank">00:53:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Built card.</span></div><div

used any credit card to pay rent, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3227" target="_blank">00:53:47.140</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:53:49.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So it was kind of an expensive way to pay your rent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3232" target="_blank">00:53:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, they've added earning Built points on top of whatever you get from your credit card</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3236" target="_blank">00:53:56.620</a></span> | <span class="t">for that same

that's not an Amex to pay your rent, you'll pay a 3% fee.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3243" target="_blank">00:54:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">You'll still get all the credit card points from that transaction and you'll also get 1x Built</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

the Built card and you need to pay rent,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3255" target="_blank">00:54:15.960</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:54:20.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you think about it from the perspective of there are cards like the Capital One Venture</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3263" target="_blank">00:54:23.960</a></span> | <span class="t">or Venture X cards that earn 2x on everything, you're going to get an extra point from Built</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3267" target="_blank">00:54:27.740</a></span> | <span class="t">on paying your

points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3270" target="_blank">00:54:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">You're paying a 3%

target="_blank">00:54:41.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I'm not usually one to suggest paying a fee to use your credit card to earn points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

getting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3290" target="_blank">00:54:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">another set of

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3432" target="_blank">00:57:12.180</a></span> | <span class="t">there is a really lucrative business credit card deal that if you have a ton of spend,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3438" target="_blank">00:57:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">could be really valuable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3440" target="_blank">00:57:20.820</a></span> | <span class="t">But when I say a ton of spend, maybe the most I've ever seen in a signup bonus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3444" target="_blank">00:57:24.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So the VentureX business card is offering 350,000 points in the form of 150,000 points after spending $30,000 and then an additional 200,000 points after spending $200,000 all within the first six months.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3459" target="_blank">00:57:39.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, obviously, if you don't have $200,000 that you need to spend on a card in the next six months,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3465"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3467" target="_blank">00:57:47.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you run a business and you have tons of expenses that you're always putting on a credit card,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3471" target="_blank">00:57:51.860</a></span> | <span class="t">it works out to an

class="t">After that $200,000 of spend, you're getting 750,000 points, which is a pretty good return for that spend.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3484" target="_blank">00:58:04.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And there aren't a lot of other cards that can match, you know, 3.75% back on that much spend.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3491" target="_blank">00:58:11.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Finally, it is last call on the Chase Sapphire Preferred 100,000 point bonus offer after spending $5,000 in three months.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3498" target="_blank">00:58:18.140</a></span> | <span class="t">There is some nuance to how you're eligible for it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3502" target="_blank">00:58:22.280</a></span> | <span class="t">To be eligible, you can't currently hold a Chase Sapphire Preferred or Reserve card,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3505" target="_blank">00:58:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and you can't have gotten a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3700" target="_blank">01:01:40.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's another one that I think is a good suggestion.</span></div><div

7th, which is the deadline for real ID to be the requirement at TSA for traveling in the US.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3715"

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3721" target="_blank">01:02:01.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you don't have either a black or a gold star or, in California, a bear with a star in it, you probably don't have a real ID.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3729" target="_blank">01:02:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And you may not be able to board a flight or go through security without it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

acceptable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3741" target="_blank">01:02:21.800</a></span> | <span class="t">If you have your global

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3750" target="_blank">01:02:30.980</a></span> | <span class="t">But just know that, as of today, if you don't have a real ID, you need one to go through security.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3756" target="_blank">01:02:36.740</a></span> | <span class="t">This episode is

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3824" target="_blank">01:03:44.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Last thing I want to mention before I wrap, I got a few messages from listeners about last week's episode on oral health with Dr. Mark.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3833" target="_blank">01:03:53.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And they really came in two flavors and I just thought the nature of my personality and this show, I thought I'd address them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3839" target="_blank">01:03:59.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So one is about guests who pitch products and the other is about fluoride and his opinions of that and fears that the show was getting a little political.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3851" target="_blank">01:04:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, on guests pitching their own product, it seems like everyone has something to sell, whether it's their book, their blog, their Instagram, their toothpaste, their ideas.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3857" target="_blank">01:04:17.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's no escaping the fact that if I have a guest on, there's probably a thing they want to promote and that's kind of the currency in which they're willing to give up their time to come on the show.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3865" target="_blank">01:04:25.860</a></span> | <span class="t">But what I try incredibly hard to do is, first, pick guests that I want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3869" target="_blank">01:04:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not just looking at who emails me and having them on the show.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3872" target="_blank">01:04:32.780</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, when we wanted to find someone to come on for oral health, I asked my dentist for a recommendation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3877" target="_blank">01:04:37.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I cold messaged him and I tried to get him to join.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3880" target="_blank">01:04:40.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And then two, I ask all my guests not to spend their time pitching in the episode.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3885" target="_blank">01:04:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And if they do, I remove it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3887" target="_blank">01:04:47.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I give them time at the end to say, where can people find more about whatever you're talking about?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3891" target="_blank">01:04:51.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And I also try to make sure you all know if me or any of my guests have some kind of interest or bias in whatever is being discussed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3899" target="_blank">01:04:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So I did that for Dr. Mark last week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3902" target="_blank">01:05:02.180</a></span> | <span class="t">The funniest thing about Dr. Mark is that he didn't even mention the name of his toothpaste at all in the entire episode.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3907" target="_blank">01:05:07.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And we did a retake of the outro of the last question because I was like, you've talked about it, but you didn't mention what it's called in case someone wants to find it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3916" target="_blank">01:05:16.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So I hope you know that this show is not a platform for people to pitch and sell things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3920" target="_blank">01:05:20.440</a></span> | <span class="t">That's not the purpose of me having a guest on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3922" target="_blank">01:05:22.380</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't accept money from guests to come on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3924" target="_blank">01:05:24.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And almost every guest is because we sought them out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3927" target="_blank">01:05:27.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So I just wanted to clear that up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3928" target="_blank">01:05:28.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Second, I wanted to talk a little bit about fluoride.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3931" target="_blank">01:05:31.580</a></span> | <span class="t">I understand that for some people, this is a very controversial topic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3935" target="_blank">01:05:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know if I knew the extent to that going into this, but I did try my best given the limited knowledge I have to kind of push back in the interview and challenge some of those opinions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3945" target="_blank">01:05:45.240</a></span> | <span class="t">At the end of the day, from all my interactions with all of you, whether it's an email or in the real world, I know that you all are incredibly smart.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3952" target="_blank">01:05:52.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And I feel like I can trust you all to do your own thinking and research if you ever hear something you might not agree with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3958" target="_blank">01:05:58.540</a></span> | <span class="t">I also think it's healthy for all of us to hear things that challenge our own beliefs from time to time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3962" target="_blank">01:06:02.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And I get that that might mean that not everyone likes every guest or everything I say or everything a guest says.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3968" target="_blank">01:06:08.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But even if you disagree with Mark on fluoride, I would be shocked if there wasn't actually something in that episode that was a valuable takeaway for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3976" target="_blank">01:06:16.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Also, don't assume that if I bring a guest on and they say something you disagree with, that that's necessarily my position at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3982" target="_blank">01:06:22.540</a></span> | <span class="t">As for being political, I honestly did not think fluoride was a very politically charged topic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3987" target="_blank">01:06:27.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I could see where people who feel that way are coming from.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3991" target="_blank">01:06:31.400</a></span> | <span class="t">If you've listened to the show long enough, I think you know this show is about upgrading and optimizing your life, money, and travel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=3997" target="_blank">01:06:37.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And while we all have political thoughts and opinions that might be different, I don't think they're relevant to the purpose of this show.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=4003" target="_blank">01:06:43.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I do my best to avoid politics on this show.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=4005" target="_blank">01:06:45.720</a></span> | <span class="t">There are tons of places, apps, shows, social media, where you can go to have that conversation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=4010" target="_blank">01:06:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">This just is not a place where I'm trying to make it a part of the show.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=4013" target="_blank">01:06:53.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I hope that the episode with Mark, whether you agree or disagree with him, at least was interesting to hear and brought to light some things about oral health that I think are really valuable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=4022" target="_blank">01:07:02.940</a></span> | <span class="t">I know it was for me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=4023" target="_blank">01:07:03.800</a></span> | <span class="t">That's all for this episode.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyPN68zl1eU&t=4025" target="_blank">01:07:05.080</a></span> | <span
