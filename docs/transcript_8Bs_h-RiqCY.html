We long ago targeted the individual apartments of this Russian leadership with individual warheads. I mean, in the window at high noon, because they were very accurate now. And they're totally stealthy if you're thinking about cruise missiles. We can put one in someone's window and it's a nuclear warhead and not just a high explosive.</p><p>So they've known that for a long time. That doesn't give anybody time to get into the bomb shelter. I mean, this has gotten really very hairy, used to be pretty straightforward. Don't bomb us, we'll bomb you. Attack in some peripheral country and we won't bomb you because you might bomb us.</p><p>We'll lose that little war, but we'll come in somewhere else. All of these things, that's complicated enough. But now we're talking about this other level.</p></div></div></body></html>
