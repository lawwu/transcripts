But he said something along the lines of this. He said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=108" target="_blank">00:01:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">"Listen, I'm not going to sell. I'm a long-term investor. I know that sometimes you just need to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">hang on during these periods. I'm just really sick and tired of losing money." And this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=118" target="_blank">00:01:58.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the problem with prolonged bear markets, is they just slowly but surely beat you down. And sometimes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=123" target="_blank">00:02:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">you just have to be patient. So, I think especially with this, John, throw up the inflation chart.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">This is the last time the Fed put us into a recession. Inflation got to almost 15% in early</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">1980. And I looked back at the monthly inflation figures from then. So, it peaked at like 14.76%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=139" target="_blank">00:02:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">We're going out two decimal places, because that's what we do here. The next month, it came in at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">like 14.73%. Then the month after that, it was 14.4%. Then 14.4% again in June. So, four months</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">after the peak, inflation was still pretty high. And that's kind of where we are now. I think it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=155" target="_blank">00:02:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">been three or four months. And it seems like it's just going down dreadfully slow, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">It was 9.1%, and then it's like 8.6%, and 8.2%, and it's really, really slow. And eventually,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">in the '80s, inflation started falling in chunks, but it took a while. It didn't go below 4% for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">three years after the peak. So, it took a long time. So, I mean, it's possible we have to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">patient. The bear market right now is approaching 10 months, right? It peaked on the very first day</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">of the year. For many individual stocks, it's longer than that. There's this overly scientific</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">term called time dilation. And I think that applies here. It's just that your sense of time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">changes based on specific events. And I think when you have actual money at stake,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the time -- because if you look back at any historical market data or backtest,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.560</a></span> | <span class="t">like a three-year bear market looks like a blip. 1987 crash looks like a blip. All this stuff over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">50, 60, 70 years looks like a blip. But when you're living in it, 10 months can feel like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">10 years, right? So, I mean, patience is always a virtue for long-term investors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think that patience is seriously put to a test when you have a prolonged bear market.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, the March 2020 crash was bad, but it lasted a month. This one's going on month 10.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And the problem is, I am confident this one is going to come to an end. They all do. Every bear</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">market in history has come to an end. I just don't know when that will be, and that's the hard part</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">for long-term investors right now. You just don't want to get to the point where you just throw your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">hands up and say, "That's it. I'm done." And that's what happened to a lot of people in 2008.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">That was 18 months from peak to trough. And a lot of people who sold at or near the bottom</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.560</a></span> | <span class="t">in early 2009 just said, "I can't take it anymore. Day after day, month after month, I'm seeing..."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the S&P 500 was down for six quarters in a row. Right now, it's down for three in a row,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and that feels awful. So I think it's just easy to get ground down, unfortunately, in these markets,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and that's the thing you've got to watch for these days.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">If we were on financial television, we'd say that's capitulation, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Isn't that the word they always use?

I don't know what that actually looks like. I've never seen it before. There's no</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.040</a></span> | <span class="t">bell for that sort of thing, either. But that's the thing. People throw up their hands and say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">"Alright, that's it.

And I think maybe people have been trained that they just don't do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">that as much anymore. Not everyone. A lot of investors just stay the course. It's tough,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">though.

I think that's probably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=373" target="_blank">00:06:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">the one that has the highest probability of happening. So, there was this case study done,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=377" target="_blank">00:06:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it was like 2011. They looked at eight Israeli judges who granted parole to people who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=382" target="_blank">00:06:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">were in jail, convicted felons.

I think they did like a thousand cases of parole. And they said that two-thirds of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=391" target="_blank">00:06:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">all parole requests were granted in the morning. But then, as you got closer to lunch, it basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=396" target="_blank">00:06:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">fell to zero. And then, after lunch, it went back to two-thirds. And then, by the end of the day,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">it fell to zero again. And they're thinking, "Why did that happen?" Well, before lunch, they were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">hungry.

And then, after lunch -- and so,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=414" target="_blank">00:06:54.720</a></span> | <span class="t">there are things outside of our control that can impact our decisions.

Obviously, we're recording this on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=459" target="_blank">00:07:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Thursday morning.

The S&P peaked in early 2000. This is after the dot-com crash. It was down</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=514" target="_blank">00:08:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">almost 30%. This is right up until September 10th.

What if earnings</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=579" target="_blank">00:09:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">don't fall as much? What if the war abruptly comes to an end? So, I think all these things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=585" target="_blank">00:09:45.920</a></span> | <span class="t">could lead to better-than-expected outcomes.

So I think that's if you increase your dividend without fail for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=806" target="_blank">00:13:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">25 years in a row. So a company like Procter & Gamble has done this for like 66 years in a row.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=811" target="_blank">00:13:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">3M I think is 64.

So it's companies, and these companies are loathe to cut because they think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=822" target="_blank">00:13:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that that sends a wrong message to investors that, oh, the cashflow is not there in these businesses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=827" target="_blank">00:13:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think if you add in some price appreciation, that sounds like a pretty good deal. The problem</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=831" target="_blank">00:13:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">is, dividend stocks are still stocks. So when the stock market falls, these stocks tend to fall as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=837" target="_blank">00:13:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">well. So John, throw up the chart of dividends. I looked at the four biggest dividend funds, ETFs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=842" target="_blank">00:14:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and looked at where they stand in comparison to the S&P and the NASDAQ this year. So the NASDAQ</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=847" target="_blank">00:14:07.600</a></span> | <span class="t">is down 34%, S&P's down 24 or something. All these dividend funds are down less than the market.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=854" target="_blank">00:14:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">There's varying degrees because some of these strategies are different in how they orchestrate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=858" target="_blank">00:14:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">these. Some of them pick dividends that are growing. Some pick dividends that have been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=862" target="_blank">00:14:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">growing for a certain amount of years. Some of them pick certain yields. But they're all doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=864" target="_blank">00:14:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">better. So the good news is, a dividend strategy, if you're picking a basket of dividends, tends to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=869" target="_blank">00:14:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">fall less than the market when the market is going down. On the other hand, it goes up less than the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=874" target="_blank">00:14:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">market when the market is rising. So you'd expect to have the lower beta. That's what we call that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=878" target="_blank">00:14:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">in finance terms. So I just think it's important to remember that this is for a diversified</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=884" target="_blank">00:14:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">approach. If you pick any one stock, we've talked about GE here in the past, AT&T, a company like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=888" target="_blank">00:14:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Verizon. These are higher yielding stocks that have gotten hammered for the price and so it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=892" target="_blank">00:14:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">didn't matter what the dividends were. So I've, sure, I've seen many investors in recent years</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=896" target="_blank">00:14:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">use dividend as a go-between for stocks. So they may take 5 to 10% from stocks and 5 to 10% from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=901" target="_blank">00:15:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">bonds and have a 10 to 20% allocation to dividends. I just think you have to understand that the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=908" target="_blank">00:15:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">dividend stocks are still stocks. So while they have some characteristics they share with bonds,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=912" target="_blank">00:15:12.720</a></span> | <span class="t">there's still some risk there. I do think one of the best parts about a dividend strategy is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=916" target="_blank">00:15:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">it's just simple. It's easy to understand. These are big blue chip companies. They pay out dividends</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=920" target="_blank">00:15:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">on a regular basis. Those dividends could increase. You just have to remember that they're still</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=925" target="_blank">00:15:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">stocks. So yeah, I mean, if you can understand the pros and cons, I don't see why not, why you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=929" target="_blank">00:15:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">can't add an allocation to them. Yeah, I guess the aristocrat, the beauty of that is that they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=935" target="_blank">00:15:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">know they'll be dropped from some ETFs and things like that if they ever, if they cut or if they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=939" target="_blank">00:15:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">break that pattern. Yeah, these companies, they'll borrow to pay dividends so they don't have to cut</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=943" target="_blank">00:15:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">because that is, they could lose an investor base that relies on them to, and I think some people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=949" target="_blank">00:15:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">also say, "I'm just going to focus on the income from these companies because it's not going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=953" target="_blank">00:15:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">drop as much during a recession or if earnings drop."

I find myself</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=980" target="_blank">00:16:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">constantly checking mortgage rates and I just don't understand why they keep going up so much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=984" target="_blank">00:16:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Last time I checked, the 10-year was still below 4%, but the 30-year mortgage rate is above 7%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=990" target="_blank">00:16:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Why are mortgage rates so much higher than bond yields?" I think last week someone called</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=994" target="_blank">00:16:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">themselves an idiot for buying a house right now and this week someone says they hate themselves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=997" target="_blank">00:16:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, just remember, this is not your fault. The timing is just awful, unfortunately.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=1004" target="_blank">00:16:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I've been thinking about this one too, though. We were talking about this internally a couple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=1007" target="_blank">00:16:47.040</a></span> | <span class="t">weeks ago. So interest rates are up across the board, but it feels like mortgage rates have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=1011" target="_blank">00:16:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">gone up way faster and way higher than government bonds or anything else. So John, let's do a chart</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=1015" target="_blank">00:16:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">on, I looked back at 10-year treasury yields versus 30-year mortgage rates and these definitely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=1020" target="_blank">00:17:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">have a relationship. You can see they follow a pretty close pattern there. Mortgage rates are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=1024" target="_blank">00:17:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">higher than treasuries, there's a spread there, but it's a pretty strong relationship. So the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=1030" target="_blank">00:17:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">average spread over the past 50 years or so, this is going back to 1971, is 1.7%. So 30-year</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=1035" target="_blank">00:17:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">mortgages average 1.7% higher than 10-year treasury yields. So the 10-year right now is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=1041" target="_blank">00:17:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">right around 4%. So in an average environment, you would expect to see mortgage rates at 5.7%</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=1046" target="_blank">00:17:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">if we're tracking that long-term average. They're actually more than 7%. So they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=1052" target="_blank">00:17:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">way higher. We're talking like a 3% difference right now. So why is this the case? Why are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=1058" target="_blank">00:17:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">mortgage rates so much higher than treasury yields? We don't know for sure, but I have some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=1062" target="_blank">00:17:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">thoughts.

Well, it depends. The public schools</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=1638" target="_blank">00:27:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">are cheaper to begin with, so I would say the opposite. I would say when you look at those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=1646" target="_blank">00:27:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">private universities that have that ... No one pays the sticker price. They do that on purpose.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=1654" target="_blank">00:27:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like I said, it's a 50% discount. So, Duncan, let's do the next question that is kind of on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=1660" target="_blank">00:27:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the other end of the spectrum here. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=1661" target="_blank">00:27:41.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. Looks like that question was from Steve, by the way. This one's from Mark.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=1668" target="_blank">00:27:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">"My wife and I are about to have our first child, but we're starting later than most.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=1671" target="_blank">00:27:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll turn 40 and she'll turn 35 by the time our daughter arrives.

So, unfortunately, Mark's daughter is going to be born into a bear market. She's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=1699" target="_blank">00:28:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">never going to know what a bull market felt like. So, there's nowhere to go but up from here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=1704" target="_blank">00:28:24.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So, okay, Tony. So, the thing that I've always heard here is you put your oxygen mask on first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=1708" target="_blank">00:28:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">as a parent and you take care of yourself first. But I also know, as someone with kids, it's hard</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=1713" target="_blank">00:28:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to tell a parent that they shouldn't put their child first. So, how does this shake out for you?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=1718" target="_blank">00:28:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a lot of things you could do. First of all, you can go in the middle. Do a Roth IRA.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=1723" target="_blank">00:28:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Because, A, you can take money out of a Roth for college expenses. And if you don't need it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=1730" target="_blank">00:28:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">you could use it for your retirement. So, you can kind of say, "All right, this is like the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=1734" target="_blank">00:28:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">college fund, but it could also be my retirement fund if that doesn't work out." Secondly, there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=1739" target="_blank">00:28:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of states that offer tax breaks and offer credits and matching programs. So, like in New</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=1748" target="_blank">00:29:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">York, for instance, if you put in up to $10,000, you get a tax break from the state tax, which is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=1756" target="_blank">00:29:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">8%. So, it's kind of like you're getting an extra $800 to put into a college fund if you just do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=1761" target="_blank">00:29:21.280</a></span> | <span class="t">that. So, if your state is very favorable in the 529 they offer, that's another thing. And there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=1768" target="_blank">00:29:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">nothing wrong with doing both. You could maybe do like 80/20. "All right, 80% of my savings is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=1776" target="_blank">00:29:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">going to go to retirement and 20% is going to go to college." And to your point, planning for what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=1781" target="_blank">00:29:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">colleges breaks are going to be in the future is really hard. It's probably almost harder than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=1786" target="_blank">00:29:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">planning for retirement for people. So, the Roth gives you some wiggle room. Absolutely. And it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=1792" target="_blank">00:29:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">also could ease your conscience, right? You're kind of like, "Oh, I'm not being selfish because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=1797" target="_blank">00:29:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I could always take money from that Roth to give to my child." So, I think personally, that's the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=1803" target="_blank">00:30:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">best of both worlds. And it's funny because a lot of times I get this question. I'm always like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=1807" target="_blank">00:30:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">"Well, what happens if we don't use all the money in the 529?" It's like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=1811" target="_blank">00:30:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">"Is that your biggest problem in life?" I don't understand why people are like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=1814" target="_blank">00:30:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">"Oh, I'm going to have to." What are you talking about? I always get that question all the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=1821" target="_blank">00:30:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm like, "Come on."

So, that 9%. Because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=1846" target="_blank">00:30:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">they measure it on six-month inflation, because it's a six-month at a time, and inflation actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=1851" target="_blank">00:30:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">over the last six months has been a little bit lower.

So, get those IBON</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcByRsP7VE&t=1860" target="_blank">00:31:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">purchases in before then if you want that 9.6%.
