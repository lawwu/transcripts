So starting May 28th, any new reservations, or if you have an existing reservation and you change it after May 28th, you're no longer going to have free check bag unless you're business extra.</p><p>They're also launching on that same day, the basic fair, which is effectively the want to get away fair rebranded, but you're no longer going to be able to make any changes or earn more than 2x points on those fairs. So they're adding their basic economy. They are not changing the cancel fees.</p><p>So even with that basic fair, you'll be able to cancel for a flight credit. But remember, Southwest flight credits now will be expiring within, I think, a year. So that also sucks.</p></div></div></body></html>
