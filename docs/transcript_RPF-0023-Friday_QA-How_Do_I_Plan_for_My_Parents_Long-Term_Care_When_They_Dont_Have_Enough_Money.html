On today's show, how do I help my parents prepare for the prospect of needing long-term care services when they are not financially prepared? Also, what do I do about my 401k, which has high fees, limited options, and no clear fiduciary? Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast for today. Today being Friday, July 18, 2014. My name is Joshua Sheets. I'm your host here with you every day. And today is going to be a Friday Q&A. I'm going to be primarily handling two questions. The two questions I just mentioned. One about long-term care planning and the other about my 401k. And then if we have time, we'll get to some inspiring reading for the weekend. So these two questions today are going to be challenging. I don't expect them to be quick. But I do want to really give some good ideas to the people that have asked the questions. As you know, I'm a doctor. I'm a doctor. I'm putting out these Friday Q&A shows every week, and I think that next Friday will be a lot better. So over the weekend, I should be able to get up and add the application on the website to allow you to phone in your feedback, so that way we can have a nice audio message that we can play on the air. And I'm excited about that. It'll help us to get a better feel for you as a caller, as a questioner. It'll help us to get a little bit better of a feel and a little bit more personal instead of the more impersonal e-mails and Twitter questions and answers that I've been answering so far. So I should be able to get that up over the weekend, over the early next week, and then I will announce it on the show as soon as that is ready to go. And then I hope that you'll call them in. But today we've got two questions that we're going to deal with, and then depending on how long the show goes, I've got a variety of articles that I'd like to talk about. If we get to them, if not, we'll push them to Monday. And so those two questions are going to be a question about 401Ks and then a question about preparing for long-term care. And I've struggled with which one to start with because neither of them are easy questions. They're both pretty difficult. They're pretty difficult for me to work through. And I hope you'll see today kind of the real challenges of financial planning because these are both real people's situations. And I don't have enough information to really give a comprehensive, complete answer that's going to fully solve the listeners' questions. But I'll try to give some ideas and point you in the right direction. And I think we'll lead off with the long-term care question. I think we'll start with that, and then we'll go into the 401K question after that. And so the long-term care question comes in from a listener. And this listener asked that I not share his name. So we will keep this listener anonymous. And by the way, I'm always happy to do that. I will generally try, unless I goof up somewhere along the way and mention something. The Twitter question coming in, I'll mention your Twitter handle. But if you send me an email with a question, I'll never read your name except just maybe your first name. So feel free to lie about that if you don't want me to read that. Or feel free to say, please leave my name out of it. So this listener was writing into me about a challenging family circumstance. And it involves long-term care. And basically, I'll summarize the facts for you. Again, I don't have complete facts, but I was able to figure out some of the information. I'll summarize the facts for you. This listener says, you know, my dad just had a stroke. And he's in the hospital. He's getting out of the hospital. But he's not doing well. And he's 81 years old. And his mom is about 20 years younger. So I'm assuming 61. 61 years old, 62, somewhere in that range. And evidently, his health has not been good for a good number of years. He's actually been out of work for about 30 years due to some physical problems that he's faced. And now he's just had a stroke. And then the good thing about the stroke is that as part of being involved in the hospital and as part of being involved in the medical system, they diagnosed him as having some advanced degree of dementia, which really helped the listener to understand a little bit more about what was going on. His relationship with his father had been very challenging over the previous years. And now he understands a little bit better, ah, it was probably due partly to the dementia. And so that was really, in some ways, although it's not a pleasant diagnosis, in some ways, it's really helpful to at least understand that there's some chemical, there's some real chemical issue in the brain that would help to explain some of the off behavior. So, but the problem is, he said, what do we do? You know, we're not exactly sure what to do. Mom and dad live alone. They're together. Each of them, they're together with each other, but they don't live with any family. They're about an hour or so away from the son. So quite a ways, quite a ways away. The son, he says, you know, the listener says, I'm not able to financially, due to my situation, I'm not able to make a large contribution. And so I inquired about some of the numbers and he shared with me, you know, dad has, dad has about $800. He has about $800. $800 a month coming in and social security income. Mom works and makes about $18,000 a year doing various things. So if you add those numbers together, they give you an annual income of about $27,600. They have maybe about 5,000 bucks of savings and they have a paid off piece of property, about three acres of land out in the country, maybe worth about 50,000 bucks and then a mobile home on top of that that's, you know, falling into disrepair little by little. And so he's an only child and he says, you know, what do I do? My heart goes out to him because this is, long-term care planning is something that's near and dear to my heart. And, you know, I may have shared on a previous episode, my grandfather had long, had dementia for, I think it was five or six years, somewhere about the age of about 90 to 95. It's hard with dementia to always pinpoint, here's exactly the point where it, where it starts. If any of you have worked through it with a family member, dementia or Alzheimer's, it's hard to point and say this was the day that it happened. But about five years is my memory is correct. And it's just a steadily, a steadily progressing disease where it just steadily gets worse and worse and worse. But it's so tough to see a loved one that you know, a loved one that you know and love going down and you don't have any hope that they're going to get better. And it's especially tough to deal with as a disease because it doesn't necessarily affect the body. It doesn't necessarily affect the physical health of the person who has the disease. So my grandfather, for example, he retired when he was in his mid to late 80s. I think I get my dates confused just about every time. He was 84, I think is when he retired, something like that. But he was, he was hardy and healthy and full of vigor and full of life. Retirement kind of did him in a little bit. Once he retired and actually sat down, he started to get old quickly. But then he started to face dementia. And in working with dementia, I learned a lot kind of going through it as a young man, trying to work and help my parents out. And it's really challenging. And one of the biggest challenges of dementia is that it doesn't affect you. It doesn't affect you physically. So you don't, unlike some diseases where you maybe have a diagnosis of cancer and the physician may be able to estimate, well, this is your life expectancy. Or some other diseases where you can say, well, this isn't necessarily expected to affect your life expectancy. With dementia, it doesn't affect your physical health. It affects your mental health. So you may be healthy as anything. And so it's very unknown as far as how to plan for it. But yet it's extremely challenging and extremely draining to work through that from a care perspective. And so my heart went out to this listener. And since I heard of his situation, I've just been thinking about the question and thinking about the question, trying to figure out what the answer is. And it's tough because in some ways there is no answer. And I'll try to do better than that. I'll try to give some ideas. But in some ways there is no answer. And I'm going to say some things. And I know the listener is listening. And I just want to say, my heart is filled with compassion and empathy. And I wish that I had some good answers for you. I don't know of any good financial answer for the situation because there's not a lot to work with. And I'll give you ideas. I've got some ideas of some programs for you to research and just kind of walk you through how I would approach it. But at the end of the day, I don't have a good answer. But I want to bring a situation like this forward to encourage the rest of you to consider doing some planning up front. Because if you'll do some planning in advance for these things, it's not going to make them emotionally easier. But it may make them a little bit easier if there's some plans in place already. And this is essentially how I think about financial planning. I don't understand why people don't want to do financial planning. This has been one of those circuits in my head that has never made sense to me. Because I guess I always joke about, well, you're going to die. So make sure you die with a will and force. Chances are this could happen. And for some reason, that's never bothered me. But I know it's not going to happen. I know it really bothers some people to think about this planning. But I tell you, when you see somebody go through a tough situation, it really helps you to say, well, I've got to do some planning. And you've got to do what you can when you can. I don't think necessarily financial planning is the magic cure that's going to fix everything. Not everybody is poor and broke because there's something somehow wrong with them morally or that they're just somehow not smart. That's not the case at all. There is bad luck that happens. There are situations that are beyond people's control. People get beat down. There are things that can happen. And that's across the board, that things can happen to all of us. And so I don't think there's any amount of planning that can guarantee anything. But I do believe that no matter the situation, a little bit of planning and some ideas can make the situation better. We see this all the time in our culture. That's why there are stories that are constantly written about somebody who is sick. And look at how even though they were sick or even though they were an amputee, they still ran the marathon. I mean, bad luck can, if you're a soldier, bad luck, you walk over a bomb or an IED or a claymore or whatever they're called nowadays. You walk over a bomb and your legs are gone. That's bad luck. But once it's done, it's done. You got to make the best of it. So that's kind of how I think about financial planning. So I'm going to do my best to give this listener some ideas, some very practical ideas, some programs to research, but also some big picture ideas. But none of this is intended to be cruel. And it's a little hard when it's impersonal where maybe you can't do it. I can't sense my empathy or my compassion, but I want to give you some answers. But I also want to use it as a learning experience. First thing, this situation, the listener being an only child and having ailing, aging parents, and then this listener not being able to help his parents very much, this is the situation that we face generationally in this country. And right now, it's especially prominent. The term that goes forward is the sandwich generation. And I don't know if this listener has children or not, but it really doesn't matter. But especially... Well, it's especially more difficult with children. But what happens is that there are millions and millions of us throughout the country who are now finding ourselves in this position or who will find ourselves in the position in the future who will find ourselves in the position of needing to care for our aging parents and of caring for our own children at the same time. And this is incredibly challenging and incredibly stressful. And there are some demographic changes that have made this very challenging. And it comes down to the small number of children and the dispersion of families and the adjustments and changes in lifestyle. Now, I'm not going to make some values judgments on these things. You do what you want with them. But these are demographic realities, and they're facing all of us, which leads to the need for planning. But, you know, and I'm going to draw some generalizations. I recognize the generalizations, and they may not apply in every case. But I think it's important to understand and to think about because this question does not need only a financial... a financial answer. In the past, traditionally, how have we cared for our elderly and aged parents? Well, normally, in the past, traditionally, the family unit was a lot tighter, a lot bigger, and a lot closer together. So in the past, we've had a society... And again, I recognize I'm idealizing a little bit, but I still think it's valid to do so in this situation to draw the lesson. In the past, we've had a society where the family units were much closer together. So we look at... We look at the Norman Rockwell painting of traditional U.S. America, and we see the family sitting down for dinner every day. Does that happen all the time? No. Were their families broken apart? Yes. But more than there is now, the family unit was in many ways much tighter, much closer relationship. There was a much larger family unit, and the work among the family unit was generally more integrated. So in an agrarian society, it would be very normal that children would grow up working with their parents every day, working with their parents, spending time with their parents, helping in the family enterprise. Traditionally, in the traditional view, this would be an agrarian enterprise, a farm. So on a farm, the children are working with the parents every day and really building this close-knit family. And then it would be unusual for the children to grow up and move very far away. Traditionally, in agrarian societies, generally, people will live somewhat close to where they were born and where they were from. And usually, you would have a high number of children, a much higher number of children than we have now. So maybe an average of five to six to seven to eight children, depending on what part of the world that you're in. Well, if you fast-forward to today and look at how different our lifestyles are... Okay, so before I go there, then the parents, as the parents age, traditionally, a farmer would never retire. You know, I have a grandfather who was a farmer, the other grandfather, not the one who had dementia, although he also was a farmer-rancher earlier in his life. But I have a grandfather who was a farmer, and he never retired. He died at 93 years old, and he never retired. Now, he had to pull back. At the end of his life, he wasn't really able to go to the farm, but he was still working on paperwork. And so traditionally, as you aged, you were still part of the family, still part of the community, and you just simply took over some of the easier jobs that were less physically taxing. But you were still part and still very engaged. So I think people, because they felt engaged as part of society, in my opinion, I think people aged a little bit more gracefully, and the family was able to help. So if all of the work is centered around the family, and you have the farmhouse, you have the fields and everything relatively nearby, and if all of the work is centered on the home, you're always going to have many people there working. It's much simpler to have caretakers around to care for the aging parents. And so this makes, traditionally, people have cared for their parents themselves. They've been able to produce and be productive, even though they're not necessarily earning an income. A grandparent can care for a grandchild much more easily. A grandparent can still help out with certain things, less physically demanding tasks. And so this is kind of the historical view. Well, fast forward, and there's been this dramatic shift over a couple of generations. And the dramatic shift has encompassed a few things. Number one, instead of an agrarian society, you have an industrialized society. So instead of home-based employment, where the family unit is working together, we have out-of-the-home-based employment, where the family unit is split. And traditionally, okay, the male in this country may have been out of the house, and now it's more normal that both parents are out of the house. So this leads to a much more fragmented family. This leads to less time with the parents, spending time with the children. This leads to the need to hire people for the raising of children, which is where you have the public education system comes in. And whether it's aspects of education, which is usually how it's thought of, or whether it's aspects of child care, which I believe there's, if you go and study it, there would be some evidence to say that that wasn't necessarily ignored when the system was established in the way it is, is that to make the transition to an industrialized society and to incorporate both workers into the workforce so that you can reduce the cost of the workers by increasing the supply of labor, go research it. I'm not convinced of it, but certainly there is literature that would indicate that people were not surprised by that development. Then if you were to go and research this, you would find that we need something to care for the children. So therefore you have school that happens during work hours, and this provides for the child care. Well, this leads to a more fragmented family where children and parents have a less intimate relationship with each other. They're maybe very busy, less together. We're not working on a common family enterprise, but we're each working on our own enterprises. Father and mother each have their own jobs. Children are encouraged to have their own jobs, and it's unusual if you find a family that's working together. And then this leads to a geographic dispersion. So with the increase in monetary wealth, with the pool of jobs, it's very abnormal for people to stay close to where they are at home, and with the reduction of the number of children, you have a dramatic change where now you have one or two children. You have one child, in the case of this author, and this child has two parents instead of five children and two parents. And so you have this dramatic generational change. So two children, two parents, one child, two parents. And then when you take that into a spouse and you say, okay, we have a male spouse who has his parents, and a female spouse has her parents, and maybe there's one or two siblings among them, now we wind up in a situation where we may have four parents and two children to care for the four parents, or two, three, four children, I mean, depending on the numbers. And then in an age of changing family dynamics, it's more likely that it's possible that the parents are divorced and now we have parents and step-parents, and now you're in a situation where instead of it just being one couple with a total of four parents, there's all the other step-parents involved. And so it changes the dynamic. And this is the reality that's facing the social security system of the reduced number of workers that are working based upon the increased number of retirees. This is the challenge that's facing us demographically in this country. Well, it hits close to home when it comes to long-term care because that means that all of the responsibility for the care of the parents, should the child choose to assume that responsibility as a child, is placed upon one or two children. This can be very challenging. So with these demographic changes, it leads to a lot of change. It leads to a difficult situation. And I point it out because it leads to a need for a whole new area of planning. And it's simply, how do we care for ourselves as we age? In the past, it was simple. Family. That was the answer, is that the family will care for me so there's no problem. The family had the capacity. But how on earth do you have the capacity nowadays? How on earth do you have the capacity if you have children that are working, financially challenged, not able to necessarily do extremely well economically for them and now they are faced with the challenge of supporting and being responsible for their parents as their parents need to care as they get older. So then that leads to the natural growth of the government programs that are in place. That leads to those government programs being overly taxed, which is what has happened with the government programs for care. One of the things that I have observed in paying attention to it is that while the expansion of traditional health insurance benefits has been steady, over time, where those programs have been, the government has little by little increasingly picked up the expansion of those, expanded their care up to and including the Affordable Care Act and the changes that that has brought in the health insurance marketplace. It has been the exact, the quietly, over the last couple of decades, it has been the exact opposite in the areas of long-term care. And long-term care meaning ongoing custodial care for not for a critical illness, it's expected to get better, but ongoing custodial care for something that's not expected to get better. And so if you go back and you trace the history of the tax law, I won't do that today in a Q&A show, but if you go back and trace the history, little by little benefits have been removed consistently and steadily. Even to the point of one of the things that got very little news, except among the professional advisor community, was there was a component of the Affordable Care Act called the CLASS Act. And I think that CLASS, if my memory is correct, stood for Community Living Assistance something or other, something like that, Community Living Assistance Program. And it was basically a federally organized version of long-term care insurance. Well, the program was such a disaster, actuarially speaking, and everyone knew it was, and everyone said it was, that it was just quietly eliminated about, I think it was a year or so after it was passed, maybe a couple of years. The dates are fuzzy in my mind. So the benefits that are available, the government benefits facing this demographic problem, the government benefits have been steadily reduced, have been steadily drawn back, because there's no money available to pay for them. And so this is a big, big area of planning that we need to pay attention to, especially as we're responsible for guiding people. I'm not going to go deep into long-term care plan today, but I'll tell you the one that ticks me off is when people put an age in for long-term care. Well, you should start planning for long-term care at age 60. Guess what? You should start planning for long-term care as soon as you're around, but you need to figure out where you're going to be. You need to figure out where it comes in in your terms of financial priorities. And I'll cover that another time. But if you can ever prove to me, this one drives me nuts, if you can ever prove to me an age where all of a sudden it makes sense to plan for long-term care that age and it didn't before that and it doesn't after that, it's absolutely ridiculous to put an age on this. Plan for it when you can, and I promise we'll do extensive in-depth planning shows on long-term care. So we need to do planning, and this is going to be a very challenging situation for this listener. I don't know how challenging. You know, the listener's father may have, may be able, may be in excellent shape after he comes out of the hospital and may be able to care for himself. But then again, he may need full-time care on an ongoing basis. And so it's impossible for obviously me to know, and I've just had an email that I'm answering publicly here. But I hope that I can have some thoughts and some ideas. So where I want to start with this is anytime you're starting with long-term care planning, start with the non-financial stuff. Don't start with the numbers because no matter what the numbers are, you start with the non-financial stuff. And the biggest misconception about long-term care is that it's a financial planning situation. It is, and you can do some things with financial planning. But I say start with non-financial. And in this situation, I want to speak directly to this listener, you need to do some careful thinking and research on the impact that care has on your life. I want to speak directly to this listener, I want to speak directly to this listener, and I want to speak directly to this listener, and I want to speak directly to this listener, and caregiving has on family. It can be an incredible blessing to care for your aging parents. I consider myself very fortunate to have been able to serve and to honor and to love my grandparents as they aged. What a way to give back for those who have cared for you and provided for you. And my parents are in excellent health, but I am, should the opportunity arise to care for them, I will consider it an honor and a blessing to be able to serve them and a way to help them. It's a way to honor our parents. So it is an incredible blessing. It's also an incredible challenge. And I want to read you some statistics here. And these statistics I'm pulling from, this is a little bit old, a 2004 National Alliance for Caregiving survey. And there are a few different sources of this list of statistics that I'm going to read, but I think they hold valid. So first of all, the majority of care that is provided for people who are chronically ill is provided by informal caregivers. And informal caregivers simply means family members, unpaid caregivers. So this would be you caring for your parents and providing the physical daily care that they need. Many children are going to be expected to care for their parents. And the challenge is that caring for the chronically ill parent often makes the caregiver chronically ill. And this is an incredible challenge that most people just simply aren't familiar with. But I guarantee if you've been involved in the care of a parent or grandparent, you're nodding your head with me right now, is that it is a tremendous challenge and a tremendous burden on the family. It can be a joyful burden and an honor, like I said, but it's a burden. There's about 45 million informal caregivers in the United States, 21% of the adult population. So in 21% of households, there's an informal caregiver. 40% of the caregivers are women. 40% are men. Women still account for most of the caregiving hours per week, about 71%. Although it is estimated that the percentages of men giving care will increase substantially because future families will have fewer children. The median age of informal caregivers is 45 years old. 62% of informal caregivers are married. 41% have children under 18 at home. Informal caregivers contribute on an average $200 out of their own pockets per month to subsidize care. Such as simply contributing money out of pocket to pay for people to give them relief from the care. 67% reported providing care between 8 and 20 hours per week. On average, an informal caregiver provides care for four and a half years. Informal caregivers provided services that if they had been provided formally would have cost around $350 billion, about the same as Medicare's total spending. 22% of informal caregivers to the elderly are depressed. Around twice the rate in the population as a whole. 55% of caregivers living with dementia patients suffer clinical depression. I'm going to repeat that. 55% of caregivers living with dementia patients suffer clinical depression. It is incredibly challenging to care for somebody with dementia on an ongoing basis. And you need to be very, very careful. Very, very careful to make sure that you are providing the support for the caregiver. An elderly informal caregiver has a significant risk of death as a result of his or her sick spouse's hospitalization. The risk to spouses was highest when the hospitalization was for a chronic disabling illness like dementia. Quote, What this shows is that people are interconnected and their health is interconnected. And seeing a person that you love suffer, seeing them ill harms you, said study co-author Dr. Nicholas Christakis of the Harvard Medical School. Elderly informal caregivers run a 63% higher risk of dying from stress-related illnesses. Informal caregivers who responded that their health has gotten worse as a result of caregiving most commonly report a loss of energy and sleep, 87%. Stress or panic attacks, 70%. Aches or pain, 60%. Depression, 52%. Headaches, 41%. And weight gain or loss, 38%. In addition, they tend to spend less time with family or friends, 69%. And at work, 37%. Abuse of the elderly by family members has risen significantly. 73% of caregivers listed prayer as the best way to cope with the stress and sadness of providing care. Alzheimer's disease is a major cause of the need for long-term care. One in eight people 65 and older have the mind-destroying illness. Half of all people over 85 are affected. 10 million Americans are currently caring for a person with Alzheimer's disease and tend to be stressed to the breaking point financially, emotionally, and physically. The challenge is about distance between, the challenge is about distance from parents. This is a study from MetLife. 15% of caregivers leave at least one hour away from their parents. 33% provide care at least once a week. Respondents estimated that care and travel amounted to one full workday per week. 23% reported that they were the only caregivers their parents had. Nearly 50% stated they spent an additional 3.4 to 4 hours per week arranging or monitoring care. 40% reported providing direct assistance with the most difficult activities of daily living. Caregivers reported spending an average of $199 per month on travel, in addition to the $200 per month they spend to help their parents. And so one quote, one quote here from this book that I'm referencing here is a quote out of a PBS documentary entitled, And Thou Shalt Honored. And one woman, when being interviewed, replied, quote, When I got married, I never really understood the vow in sickness and in health. Now I do. His sickness, my health. For it to be easy for me, it would have to be over for my husband. That's unacceptable. I often wonder, will there be anything left of me when he passes away? Will there be anything left for me? It's probably a good place to stop. So I take a moment just to read those statistics because I had seen prior to my learning those statistics, and I learned that years ago. I was reading those statistics from a manual that I had, a financial planning manual for a certificate. I got years ago called the Certification in Long-Term Care Planning. And when I read those statistics, it was the first designation that I went out and pursued after becoming a financial planner because of my experience with it and also because it was kind of an easier designation to get. And when I read those statistics, I was just stunned. I had never had any idea. And that was, again, those are a little bit dated. I'm sure they're even more significant now. So I point them out to you just to be aware of them because, this makes a big difference. Now, if you're aware of something, you can put plans in place to avoid the major problems. So, for example, if you're aware of the fact that a tremendous percentage of parents, I forget the statistics. I'll have to check them some other time. But if you're aware of the fact that there is a tremendously high divorce rate among parents who have either lost a child to death or who are dealing with a child who's disabled, then if you lose a child to death or you have a child who's disabled, you can plan for that. And you can recognize, my marriage is in danger. I need to take extra special steps for this. Or if you're aware of the fact that the majority of lottery winners become broke or bankrupt soon after winning their lotteries, then if you win the lottery, then you can make plans and you can say, wait, I need some careful and special. This doesn't have to happen, but I need to do something very carefully to make sure that I avoid it. And I need to make sure that I avoid it. So I need to make plans in place to deal with that as best you can. It's going to be financial stress. Again, the average is $200 a month of contributions to pay a caregiver to give your parents some sort of extra help, plus $200 a month of living expenses, excuse me, of travel expenses, just to get there. And you can understand, if you live an hour away from your parents and you're going to travel there for one hour a week, excuse me, at least a day or two a week, that's going to bring a tremendous financial burden just on gasoline and wear and tear on a vehicle. So we need to make some plans that are going to help to improve this. Now, unfortunately, I don't have any good plans because you've got to look at the actual situation. You've got to say, well, what do my parents need? What do they have? Is there a way that we could somehow live together to diminish costs? Now, that may or may not be possible depending on the situation. Is there a way that I can contribute financially? Is there a way that... You know, you've got to find a plan. And I'm going to talk through some of the benefits that you need to research to see what's available to you as far as for extra help. But the big thing is not going to be any kind of benefits because, frankly, there are none. And I say that as a blanket statement. There are a few, but there's generally not much. And this is because it's an epidemic that we're facing in the country. And unless you've done prior planning, and unless you've saved money for this situation, unless you have money to pay for a caregiver, a formal caregiver, or unless you have something like a long-term care insurance policy that can fund it, then there's not a financial solution. There's not. You have to commit to providing the care and figuring it out as you go. Now, you shouldn't feel bad about not planning because the reality is that if you had started five years ago with this planning and you were sitting in my office and we said, okay, if your dad and mom were sitting there and your dad is 75 years old, and then considering some of the other health problems that you shared with me, I would have said, there's nothing you can do. It's too late. It's too late. After those health problems, after you have certain health problems, you can't buy insurance, and you don't have the money, and you're not working. So don't beat yourself up about not doing the planning in the past. Just recognize that it's going to be very much a non-financial answer, not so much a financial answer. So continuing on. Okay. I've got to pick up the pace here. So what do you need to do? Well, first of all, you need to spend a lot of time researching. There is no one place that I can send you to to say, here's the information. I'm going to give you some ideas of some things that I think you need to research and some programs to investigate and a broad brush stroke of how they work to see, to see what may or may not be available to you. But the key is you've got to become a researching hound to find the information that you need. It's not served up to you on a platter anywhere that I've ever been able to find. First of all, you said that your father was a Korean-American. This is good. Okay. Because there may be some veteran benefits, although it's usually unlikely. So first of all, what about veteran benefits of the traditional, you know, the health insurance benefits? You should know by this point what benefits your father is entitled to. And in general, the Veterans Administration will provide some long-term care benefits. And real quick, a quick thing you need to understand. Long-term care, when I use that word, what long-term care refers to is long-term care refers to something called a chronic illness. And a chronic illness is for something that's not expected to get better. So the example here would be Alzheimer's. Okay. Alzheimer's is not expected to get better. There's no cure that anyone that I'm aware of, anyone has found for Alzheimer's. There's not really any treatment that I know that can be expected to improve it, although maybe it could be slowed down through brain stimulation and physical exercise. I've read some of the studies on that. But I'm not aware of somebody saying we can improve the situation through this certain treatment. So something like Alzheimer's, once you're diagnosed with Alzheimer's, it's something you have. And you're not going to get any, it's not expected to get better. Now, that would be compared with falling and breaking your leg. Well, that's considered to be an acute illness. And it's something that is going to get better. So when I say long-term care, I'm talking about ongoing, what's called custodial care. Care with the activities of daily living. Care with bathing, dressing. Help assistance with toileting, with transferring between a bed and a chair. Those types of things. Those are all considered to be activities of daily living. And if you spend some time, so that's custodial care. So when I talk about long-term care, I'm talking about ongoing custodial care. Not, okay, you went into the hospital. Your father is covered under the veterans system and also under Medicare. So that's going to take care of some of the hospital benefits based upon what part Medicare is he in. Does he have a supplement plan or not? That's all, you should be familiar with that by this point. But the Veterans Administration provides a lot of information about what's going on in the military. And so they do it based upon priorities. And so as you should be familiar with by now, the veterans benefits are divided into eight tiers. So tiers one through eight with some sub tiers based upon whether or not a veteran has a service-related disability. And so a disability that was related to their service in the military. And so priority group one is veterans that have a service-related disability that is 50% or more disability-related. So that's the priority group one. And then priority group two is veterans who are determined by the VA to be unemployed due to service-related, service-connected conditions. So if you are extremely disabled because of some injury that you receive while being in military service, then you're in priority group one. And in this situation, there's a very high chance that you will qualify for long-term care benefits under the veterans system. Priority group two would be veterans with service-connected disabilities rated 30 or 40% disabling. Priority group three, veterans with service-connected disabilities rated 10 or 20% disabling. Veterans who were former prisoners of war. Veterans awarded the Purple Heart. Veterans whose discharge was for a disability that began in the line of duty. Veterans who were disabled because of VA treatment or participation in a VA vocational rehabilitation program. And it goes on down through the eight lists. And if you go down into groups six, seven, and eight, there's sub-priorities. So in group eight, for example, priority group eight, veterans who agree to pay a specified copayment with service-connected disabilities with income and or net worth above the VA means test threshold and the geographic means test threshold. Sub-priority A, non-compensable 0% service-connected veterans enrolled as of January, blah, blah, blah. So there's all these sub-priorities. Go Google it. You'll find it right on the Veterans Administration website, all this information. You want to find out what group your father is in and just see if there's any chance of getting benefits. I do not know how far down this list they are currently providing benefits. In the past, when I have researched it, it was only, the first few, and basically as the costs have gone up and as the budgets have gotten more thin, the VA has had to cut back on benefits. The best thing to do there is just become very close to the VA consultants that are at the VA and see if there's some program that they know of. Now, one thing that would not necessarily be connected to that priority system would be what's called the aid and attendance, the aid and attendance special pension. And so what this is, is the special pension that will pay for additional amounts of money for a veteran who is receiving care at home. So I will put a link in, I'll put a link in the show notes here. I'll put two links here, one from veteranaid.org and the other from benefits.va.gov. And so the veteranaid.org says, eligibility for the aid and attendance pension. Any wartime veteran with 90 days of active duty, one day beginning or ending during a period of war, is eligible to apply for the aid and attendance improved pension. A surviving spouse, marriage must have ended due to death of a veteran or of a wartime veteran, may also apply. The individual applying must qualify both medically and financially. To see the periods of war that have been qualified by Congress, follow this link. To qualify medically, a wartime veteran or surviving spouse must need the assistance of another person to perform daily tasks, such as eating, dressing, undressing, taking care of the needs of nature, etc. Being blind or in a nursing home for mental or physical incapacity, or residing in an assisted living facility, also qualifies. And it goes on and talks about how to get eligibility. So this is an additional pension benefit that you may be eligible of in addition to the other monthly pension benefits. So you would want to research this. You need to be housebound. And so this might be an option where even at housebound with in-home care, if your father needs in-home care, this may be something where you may be eligible for an additional pension. Now, depending on the income limits, you need to, you need to check out the income limits on this program and need to look at the eligibility limits. But this would be something that would be something to research and see if you would qualify or not. As far as any TRICARE benefits, TRICARE doesn't cover long-term care. Basically, that's the broad brush stroke because TRICARE is similar to health insurance. So let's just leave it there and not talk about any exceptions to any of that. So the next program, Medicare and Medicaid. So in broad strokes, Medicare will not provide any long-term care benefits. So now that I've said that, here's what they will provide. Long-term care, excuse me, Medicare will provide long-term care benefits if care is received in a nursing home following, I think it's a three-day hospital stay. And the way they do that is they will pay for the first 20 days of care that are needed in a nursing home after a hospital stay. They'll pay for the first 20 days each 100%. And then they will help pay for days 20 through 100 as long as you pay a daily copay. And I think that's a good thing. I think the current daily copay rate is in the vicinity of about $150 a day. So if your father is getting out of the hospital and he goes into a nursing home, Medicare, because he's in the hospital for a stroke, Medicare will pay for the first 20 days. And then for days 20 through 100, you'll pay $150 a day copay and Medicare will pick up the balance. After 100 days, there are no more Medicare benefits available. So after the first 100 days, there are no more Medicare benefits available. So in general, Medicare is not a solution for all of us. They're ongoing long-term care. That's why I say Medicare doesn't provide any long-term care benefits. Now, Medicaid, which is financial assistance for people for their health situations who are broke and who don't have any money and don't have any assets, Medicaid will provide long-term care benefits. In general, Medicaid will provide long-term care benefits primarily in nursing facilities, primarily in nursing homes. Now, there have been some changes in this situation over the last few years where Medicaid has been tested and there have been some changes in various programs in different states to try to provide more in-home health care. And there's something that's, this is a challenging area of government policy because when they try to provide in-home health care, that's cheaper. It's cheaper for the, it would be cheaper for the government to provide in-home health care for many people more so than providing for facility-based care such as a nursing home or an alternate living facility. So let's go with nursing home versus in-home health care to simplify our example. It's cheaper to provide in-home health care. Now, the concern is that if those benefits are too generous, then what will happen is that because the majority of people receiving care are currently, are currently doing it informally with no compensation, so this would be your mom caring for your dad at home, she's not going to get any compensation for that. Because, because they're currently receiving care informally, if Medicaid starts paying for people to receive in-home health care, the concern is that, you know, there's going to be caregivers coming all out from home health care from all over the place, coming out of the woodwork and saying, hey, pay us money, or just pay for me to keep my family member at home, and that way I can do less of the physical work of the care, and yet they can still be at home. They actually call this the woodwork principle, and it's a big deal in government policy to try to figure this out. Now, Medicaid is a state-run program, so each individual state will have their own benefits, and again, various programs are testing, various states are testing their programs. I don't know which state you live in. I live in Florida, so I'm somewhat familiar with Florida's Medicaid laws, but I'm not familiar with your state, and so I'm not going to make any comment about what your state will do. Just remember that as a big, broad brushstroke. In general, Medicaid will provide for care. Most of the care they'll provide is for a nursing home, and this is kind of the constant challenge because very few people want their family members to be in a nursing home. Most people would prefer their family members to be in the comfort of their own home where they're familiar with the surroundings and they're comfortable and have the things that they value around them. However, there are very few governments that are going to be able to provide for that. So you want to make sure that you are aware of that. If you feel that Medicaid is going to be a solution, if you check out your services and you check out the information on your state's Medicaid programs, you need to find out the qualification and how do you qualify it and what are the restrictions on qualifications. In order to qualify for Medicaid, you have to have income and assets under certain strict numbers, and then you have to qualify Medicaid. So you have to have income and assets under certain numbers. And with each state, it's a little bit different. But in general, there are three different categories of assets. There are what are called countable assets, which are called non-exempt or available assets in some states. There are non-countable assets or exempt assets, and then there are inaccessible assets. And so the key is to look at your parents' asset mix and figure out which of their assets under your state's Medicaid laws would be countable assets versus non-countable assets. So countable assets are any personal resources that are owned or controlled by an applicant for Medicaid benefits. So these must be spent on care before qualifying for Medicaid. Usually this would include stocks, bonds, cash, investments, pension plans, annuities, a primary residence, life insurance, vacation properties, investment properties, basically any assets. With a primary residence, there's almost always an exception for a spouse. Okay, so we'll talk about that in a second. Then you have the non-countable assets, which would be a small amount of money, usually a few thousand bucks, primary residence, especially if there's a spouse that is surviving a community-based spouse, maybe some life insurance, some term life insurance, or some kind of business assets and maybe an inexpensive car for personal use and then various personal items. In general, Medicaid, you're going to have to get rid of all of your assets except for those non-countable assets. And so as far as the primary residence, there may be a state, a cap on an amount of value that's set by your state. It's usually either about a half a million or $750,000. So under this scenario, your dad's house would be fine. And then also there's usually exceptions for the spouse. So the laws are generally written such that you're not going to be required to impoverish your mother in order to provide for your father. And so that's in general going to be the situation. Now, again, there are exceptions. So check your state's Medicaid laws to see what your actual situation would be. And then you're going to look at inaccessible assets. And so inaccessible assets would be anything that the government says this has to be provided for the care. And so they're trying to, maybe if this would be where you get into the situation where someone's trying to transfer assets to their children or transfer assets to a friend, and then the Medicaid administrator looks at it and says, well, this is a fraudulent transfer. Even though this asset isn't accessible to you, it has to be spent on your care before you're eligible for Medicaid. There is now a five-year look-back period for Medicaid eligibility. So what that means is that on the date that you go to apply for Medicaid, there is a five-year look-back period under which the Medicaid administrator can technically undo any financial transactions that you have done or count them towards your, your Medicaid bill. So for example, if you have a half a million dollars of cash and you transfer that to your son, and then you go and apply for Medicaid the next day, well, that transfer is going to, you're going to have to spend that half a million dollars. It's going to have to be spent on your care before Medicaid will provide you with the care that you need. So this is a much longer transfer period. So you would want to consider doing some Medicaid planning. Now in your situation, it's going to sound pretty simple. But once you research your estate's financial status, you're going to find that you're going to have to spend half a million dollars on your care. And that's going to be a lot of money. And if you're going to be spending half a million dollars on your care, you're going to have to spend half a million dollars on your care. And that's going to be a lot of money. And so you're going to have to spend half a million dollars on your care. And so you're going to have to spend half a million dollars on your care.
