My accountant said it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">was simple, right? You've had a big year, LinkedIn's going public. Think about how much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">you give to charity every year and multiply it by 10 and that's a good place to start for funding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">your account.

The biggest thing I advocate for people and recommend is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">just to have a goal.

There's two things that you do to make that. One is you actually figure out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">what your goal is and second, you automate it, right?

Like some people use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">percentages, some people use numbers, big numbers, small numbers. For some people, it's about where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.240</a></span> | <span class="t">they are in life and if they can afford to do it. But the thing that was universal is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.520</a></span> | <span class="t">actually almost everyone does have an opinion about it.

And then of course, we all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">know great ways to stick to goals once we set them. Yeah. Automation is great. Are there benchmarks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=329" target="_blank">00:05:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">even for people who are not sure what's even normal? You know, the data actually exists,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=333" target="_blank">00:05:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">right? So the IRS, I mean, publishes data every year based on zip code and a number of different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">factors about how much giving happens. There are also private institutions. I'm actually an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">investor in one private company called Windfall Data, which actually assesses this for nonprofits,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=348" target="_blank">00:05:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">et cetera. So the data's out there, but almost no one accesses it. It's not easy to come by.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, one of the features we put into our initial release is that it's a mobile app, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=358" target="_blank">00:05:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So based on the zip code, the city or state you're in, we tell you what the median household in your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=364" target="_blank">00:06:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">city gives to charity every year. Okay. It's a very natural question. I think most of us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">want to be good people. We want to do the right thing. I actually think one of the problems in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=374" target="_blank">00:06:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">philanthropy is that there isn't enough information available to people, right? Like, think about how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=379" target="_blank">00:06:19.360</a></span> | <span class="t">many calculators there are out there that help people figure out how much they should save for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=383" target="_blank">00:06:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">retirement or save for college or how much they need to do to buy a house. I mean, there's probably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">too many of those calculators out there, too many articles. But when it comes to giving,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=392" target="_blank">00:06:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">it's all amorphous.

Like, and you get the alumni booklet,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=400" target="_blank">00:06:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">you can see the tiers of who's giving and how much, but we really don't have a lot of information</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=405" target="_blank">00:06:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">about it. I think it makes us all a little uncomfortable. We feel a little guilty, I think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">because we don't know if we're doing enough or doing the right amount. And I think that most</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=417" target="_blank">00:06:57.120</a></span> | <span class="t">of us want to do the right thing. Well, it sounds like the best bar is if you're just doing it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=422" target="_blank">00:07:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that's great. And similar to saving, when I give people advice for saving, I say, "Well, first off,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=428" target="_blank">00:07:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">just start saving. And then if you're not sure what to do, start small. And if it feels like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=431" target="_blank">00:07:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">you could do more, increase your savings rate." And I assume you could just apply a similar metric</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=436" target="_blank">00:07:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">there if you're like, "I don't know how much I can afford to give, but I know I could give</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=439" target="_blank">00:07:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">$100 a month." It's like, "Great, do that." At the end of the year or at the end of six months,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=444" target="_blank">00:07:24.480</a></span> | <span class="t">does that feel low? Maybe try to increase the number if it does. If it feels like too much,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=448" target="_blank">00:07:28.560</a></span> | <span class="t">you can dial it back. But just starting somewhere and tracking it might give you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=453" target="_blank">00:07:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">some place to compare and contrast what changes you'd make in the future.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=458" target="_blank">00:07:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. I can't agree more. This is one of the things I love about this space is I think we've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=463" target="_blank">00:07:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">learned a lot in the last 10 or 20 years about how to help people save, how to help people invest,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=468" target="_blank">00:07:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">how to help people hit their financial goals. I'm really excited about this idea of applying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=472" target="_blank">00:07:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">all those lessons to philanthropy, to giving. And most of those lessons apply. So yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=476" target="_blank">00:07:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">just get started. How should I get started saving for retirement? Well, the first thing to do is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=482" target="_blank">00:08:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">actually to start saving for retirement. And the rest comes pretty naturally. And I think with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=487" target="_blank">00:08:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">giving, it's even better than saving or investing in a number of ways. I mean, I love saving and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=492" target="_blank">00:08:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">investing, let's be clear. I do. But when you give money and you feel that your money went</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=498" target="_blank">00:08:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">somewhere, had real impact on real people, on something you care about, it's a different kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=503" target="_blank">00:08:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">of reward. And so I actually agree with your advice. I think that you get started giving</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=510" target="_blank">00:08:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">to a cause, to an organization you care about, not just a checkbox on a window, something that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=515" target="_blank">00:08:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">you actually meaningfully care about. And no matter how much the amount is, it can be just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=520" target="_blank">00:08:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">a few dollars. In general, when you do it, it's a good experience. And most people want to do it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=526" target="_blank">00:08:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">again. And so yeah, getting started. Well, that's the right place to start. I remember I had given</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=535" target="_blank">00:08:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">to a charity water birthday thing, which was all the rage maybe 5-10 years ago. It seemed like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=541" target="_blank">00:09:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">everyone was doing a birthday event for that. And then they tracked you and said, "Hey, here's that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=545" target="_blank">00:09:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">well that your money a year or two ago contributed to opening." And maybe it was even a shorter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=551" target="_blank">00:09:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">window. I can't remember. And I remember, "Oh, wow, that felt really good." And that level of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=557" target="_blank">00:09:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">follow-through from the organization was really cool. One of the questions I think a lot of people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=561" target="_blank">00:09:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">have is how do you even decide whether an organization you might want to give to is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=566" target="_blank">00:09:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">responsible one, is going to follow through and use the money wisely? I know there's some sites</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=571" target="_blank">00:09:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">with ratings, but is that the best way to do it? Is there a way you recommend people do diligence</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=577" target="_blank">00:09:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">if they're thinking about where to give? Well, I think this is another problem that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=581" target="_blank">00:09:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">people have and talk about is while everyone wants to give, everyone has a little bit of an anxiety</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=586" target="_blank">00:09:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">of, "Well, how do I know that this organization is legitimate? How do I know if this organization</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=592" target="_blank">00:09:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is good? And then, of course, is it where my money will be best spent?" And there are a lot of sites.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=598" target="_blank">00:09:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a lot of information available. Once again, the IRS does publish a list of all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=604" target="_blank">00:10:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">valid registered charities for the most part in the U.S. But this gets back to a problem we have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=609" target="_blank">00:10:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">in the U.S. in general, which is that we're not comfortable talking about money with each other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=614" target="_blank">00:10:14.720</a></span> | <span class="t">We don't talk about giving as well. I mean, the reason those birthday campaigns are so effective</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=619" target="_blank">00:10:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">on Facebook and work is because actually it turns out it's not just social proof. It's that if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=625" target="_blank">00:10:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">know the person and they think that that charity is a good one, well, you've outsourced a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=630" target="_blank">00:10:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">bit of that validation, right? Their reputation, your relationship, you decide to say, "Well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=635" target="_blank">00:10:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">this is clearly a good enough organization for them and it's meaningful to them, and I will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=639" target="_blank">00:10:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">support them, and it also feels good to give." And so I do think that that is part of the process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=645" target="_blank">00:10:45.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I think people should be less afraid to ask each other what organizations and causes they support.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=651" target="_blank">00:10:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I think people should be less afraid to share the organizations that they personally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=655" target="_blank">00:10:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">support and why.

I even did matching campaigns where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=664" target="_blank">00:11:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I said, "Hey, everyone, for this month, if you give to this charity, I'll match it," type of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=670" target="_blank">00:11:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">thing, which you've probably seen on Twitter from a lot of celebrities and other folks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=673" target="_blank">00:11:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think there's a lot of value to that and elevating these charities. If you talk to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=677" target="_blank">00:11:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">folks who run these charities, they're desperate for people to talk more about what they do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=682" target="_blank">00:11:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">There's no amount of marketing they can do that really has the same impact of actual validation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=688" target="_blank">00:11:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and endorsement from people who believe in that charity, believe in that cause.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=693" target="_blank">00:11:33.280</a></span> | <span class="t">But yes, for people who want to look at the data, there are a number of sites that do good jobs of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=697" target="_blank">00:11:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">ratings and percentages.

I'd also encourage people to consider giving locally. Some great organizations are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=713" target="_blank">00:11:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">within a mile of where you live, of where you work. And it's not that hard to find local</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=720" target="_blank">00:12:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">organizations and certainly not that hard to check them out and validate them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=724" target="_blank">00:12:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But many people tend to just stick to the big names that they've heard of,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=729" target="_blank">00:12:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">names because they think that they're safer.

The U.S.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=768" target="_blank">00:12:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">is known in philanthropy circles as a very generous nation. And that's because if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=773" target="_blank">00:12:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">look at the percent of our economy that we actually give, it's very high. So in 2020,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=778" target="_blank">00:12:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">it was $471 billion in the U.S. That roughly worked out to be about 2.3% of GDP.

Is it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=797" target="_blank">00:13:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">about economics?

That was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=1290" target="_blank">00:21:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">just not something that last year or any previous year had come across my radar.

I played the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=1316" target="_blank">00:21:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">diversification game.

And I know that probably doesn't bode well for the recurring,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=1328" target="_blank">00:22:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">ongoing relationship.

And I was like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=1710" target="_blank">00:28:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">"This is just a different company."

The simple reason why it is true is that the existing industry, to offer a donor advised</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=1751" target="_blank">00:29:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">fund, you have to be a nonprofit. But nonprofits have trouble investing in technology and operations</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=1760" target="_blank">00:29:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and all the things that they need to do to run a donor advised fund. So they almost always partner</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=1764" target="_blank">00:29:24.240</a></span> | <span class="t">with a for-profit company that helps them operate and fund the development of the firm.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=1770" target="_blank">00:29:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And so Fidelity Charitable partners with Fidelity Investments, Schwab Charitable with Schwab,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=1776" target="_blank">00:29:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">of course, Vanguard Charitable partners with Vanguard.

Even</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=1825" target="_blank">00:30:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Vanguard does it, right? A percent of your fund. The problem there, though, is that because they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=1833" target="_blank">00:30:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">are charging a percent of assets, they really are only interested in very large accounts,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=1838" target="_blank">00:30:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">right? And so when you think about this, you might have a large account, say, for retirement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=1843" target="_blank">00:30:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">It's your whole retirement.

I mean, Vanguard, I love Vanguard. It's one of my favorite firms,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=1870" target="_blank">00:31:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">changed the industry, idolized.

And they charge 60 basis points all the way up to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=1882" target="_blank">00:31:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">$500,000. And so I think that's the other problem that you see that the reason they don't invest in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=1887" target="_blank">00:31:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">technology heavily there is they're not hitting a mass market audience.

The fees are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=1922" target="_blank">00:32:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">coming out of money that's not mine anymore.

And I've met lots of them. Yeah. That's an area that I flipped around on. If you had talked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=3370" target="_blank">00:56:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">to me 10 years ago, I probably mostly would have said there's some really unhealthy marketing push</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=3376" target="_blank">00:56:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that's across society and the industry that keeps pushing people towards rental real estate as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=3381" target="_blank">00:56:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">somehow the best path to financial freedom. That being said, the Federal Reserve, there was a paper</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=3387" target="_blank">00:56:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">that came out at the end of 2017, I shared in my class, et cetera, that kind of exposed the fact</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=3394" target="_blank">00:56:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that most of the data that historically had been aggregated about real estate did not include rental</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=3399" target="_blank">00:56:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">income, right? So most of the data you saw about real estate as an asset class covered the idea of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=3405" target="_blank">00:56:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the capital gains from it and not the income from it. And so they did a very good job of looking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=3410" target="_blank">00:56:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">across 20 different cities in the Europe and the US over a hundred years, all different timespans,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=3415" target="_blank">00:56:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">et cetera.

But when you do that sharp ratio, when you look at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=3429" target="_blank">00:57:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">the risk-adjusted return, rental income, rental properties are better than I think the industry</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=3436" target="_blank">00:57:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">gave them credit for.

I think there's a natural instinct from a lot of people, a dream of running their own</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=3455" target="_blank">00:57:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">business. And in many ways, owning rental properties sounds like a financial investment,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=3460" target="_blank">00:57:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">but really it's running a business, right? And I think there are a lot of people who like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=3464" target="_blank">00:57:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">running a business, and they like the idea of learning how that business makes money,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=3467" target="_blank">00:57:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and they like learning how to be successful at it.

It's a lifestyle. As much as owning a restaurant would be,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=3480" target="_blank">00:58:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">or for you and me, it might be a venture-backed software company. But I think that I've grown to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=3485" target="_blank">00:58:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">accept the fact that the reason it's so attractive is because people don't look at it purely as an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=3489" target="_blank">00:58:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">investment option.

Now, I think where people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=3494" target="_blank">00:58:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">go astray is, you actually even mentioned this, I think, briefly, considering rental properties</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERMZviCHx0&t=3498" target="_blank">00:58:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">some form of passive income, I think it's too idealistic.
