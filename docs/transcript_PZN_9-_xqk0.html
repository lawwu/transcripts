I kind of live my life in Discord nowadays. It's one of the most productive chat applications I've worked in over the last 30-plus years. Probably the best I've ever used was like 35 years ago, a usernet client called RN, but Discord maybe is my second most productive.</p><p>I have a lot of servers in Discord, as you can see, because kind of most AI happens in Discord nowadays. So how do I manage this efficiently? It's basically all about keyboard shortcuts. What I want to do each day is read the channels that I actually care about and ensure that if somebody needs my attention that they get it.</p><p>To read the channels that I care about, I can see on my screen that the ones marked with little blobs here are the ones that have unread messages. I don't want to miss any messages from the channels I care about, so I'm going to read all of them. So to make sure I just read all of them, I start at the very top and I hit Option + Shift + Down, or I guess on a Windows it would be Alt + Shift + Down, and it takes me directly, as you can see, to my next unread.</p><p>Read that, Alt + Shift + Down or Option + Shift + Down, next unread, Option + Shift + Down, next unread, and I'll just keep doing this. And you'll see it even jumps into threads as well, so it's showing these unread stuff inside threads. So I really make sure that I don't miss anything.</p><p>Now I'm at the end of this channel. Actually one thing, server, one thing I will mention is it's really important then to make sure that you don't see unread stuff in things you don't care about. So here's an example of something I don't care about, bot messages. So I've already gone in here and said Mute Channel.</p><p>To make sure I don't even see it, actually, I will go ahead and say Hide Muted Channels. So now I don't even see it at all. The other thing is that some servers have administrators who use @Everyone or @Here too often. So if that's the case, you can always just say Notification Settings, sorry, I go Notification Settings, I'm sorry, for the server, and you can say Suppress @Everyone and @Here, and also make sure it's set to only @Mentions.</p><p>That way you'll only get notified of stuff which is specifically sent to you. OK, so we've finished this server's channel, so if I press Option + Shift + Down again, it's now gone to the next server, which in this case is the HTMX server. And so I continue on, reading all of these, and you can see as I do each one, it gets marked as red.</p><p>OK, and I've finished that server, one more, and we're on to the next one. OK, so that's the key thing to know, is make sure that you mute any servers that you don't really need to know about. Also, you can mute categories and channels, so in fact, for example, I'm not in any study groups for Fast.ai, so I just went ahead and muted the whole category.</p><p>And then when you create messages, it's important to know that if you hit Shift + Enter, it doesn't send it, and that's the key thing to adding stuff like Python code. So just put back triple backticks, Python, triple backticks, and hit Shift + Enter after each line, and then when you're done, hit Enter.</p><p>And then the other thing that's useful to know about is that you can then hit this little button up here to create a thread and give it a message. And now we've got a thread going, that's a really good way to make sure that you can have a long conversation without getting confused.</p><p>Oh, and if you're worried why this is Jeremy with a U, this is actually a channel I share with my daughter, who told me that on Discord, when talking to her, it's necessary to always not have any Es in my name or messages. So everything has to be U.</p><p>Oh, I should have changed this to message U. Oh well, sorry Claire. So, other than that problem with too many Es, that's my quick introduction to being more productive with Discord. And this is my first little experiment of doing fast, short little videos about small things, so let me know if you find this helpful.</p></div></div></body></html>
