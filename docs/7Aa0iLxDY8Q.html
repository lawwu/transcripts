So what I think you do is yes I think the minute</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Aa0iLxDY8Q&t=843" target="_blank">00:14:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">you discover an algorithm like this you post it to GitHub because you know what's going to happen</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Aa0iLxDY8Q&t=846" target="_blank">00:14:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">if you don't? The feds are going to come to your door. They're going to take it. The worst people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Aa0iLxDY8Q&t=854" target="_blank">00:14:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">will get their hands on it if you try to keep it secret. Okay let's say okay we have a 10x system</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Aa0iLxDY8Q&t=860" target="_blank">00:14:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">or whatever but we hit the chimp level. We're going to get a 10x system. We're going to get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Aa0iLxDY8Q&t=861" target="_blank">00:14:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">a 10x level. We jump across the chimp general level or whatever right? And now you have a system</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Aa0iLxDY8Q&t=867" target="_blank">00:14:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">which is like John Von Neumann level or whatever right? And it runs on one tiny box and you get a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Aa0iLxDY8Q&t=871" target="_blank">00:14:31.520</a></span> | <span class="t">thousand of those. So it's very easy to scale up to a thousand x. So then maybe you have your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Aa0iLxDY8Q&t=877" target="_blank">00:14:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">thousand John Von Neumanns improve the efficiency by another two, five, ten x. Now we're already at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Aa0iLxDY8Q&t=882" target="_blank">00:14:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">ten thousand x or a hundred thousand x improvements right? So just from scaling up the amount of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Aa0iLxDY8Q&t=887" target="_blank">00:14:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">hardware including with them. I suspect to be honest we might have the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Aa0iLxDY8Q&t=891" target="_blank">00:14:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">answer to that question within a decade or certainly two. And many of those at OpenAI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Aa0iLxDY8Q&t=896" target="_blank">00:14:56.640</a></span> | <span class="t">are thinking of this question too. Here is Paul Cristiano the former head of alignment at OpenAI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Aa0iLxDY8Q&t=902" target="_blank">00:15:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">pushing back against Eliezer Yudkowsky. While Yudkowsky believes in extremely fast recursive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Aa0iLxDY8Q&t=908" target="_blank">00:15:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">self-improvement others like Jan Leiker and Paul Cristiano are banking on systems making superhuman</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Aa0iLxDY8Q&t=915" target="_blank">00:15:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">contributions to domains like alignment research before they get that far. In other words using</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Aa0iLxDY8Q&t=920" target="_blank">00:15:20.560</a></span> | <span class="t">models that are as efficient as they are as a result of the research that they do. So let's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Aa0iLxDY8Q&t=921" target="_blank">00:15:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">end now with Amaday's thoughts on AI consciousness and happiness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Aa0iLxDY8Q&t=933" target="_blank">00:15:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you think that cloud has conscious experience? How likely do you think that is?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Aa0iLxDY8Q&t=937" target="_blank">00:15:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">This is another of these questions that just seems very unsettled and uncertain. One thing I'll tell</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Aa0iLxDY8Q&t=941" target="_blank">00:15:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">you is I used to think that we didn't have to worry about this at all until models were kind of like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Aa0iLxDY8Q&t=947" target="_blank">00:15:47.120</a></span> | <span class="t">operating in rich environments. Like not necessarily embodied but they needed like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Aa0iLxDY8Q&t=951" target="_blank">00:15:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">have a reward function and like have kind of long-lived experience. So I still think that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Aa0iLxDY8Q&t=956" target="_blank">00:15:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">might be the case but the more we've looked at kind of these language models and particularly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Aa0iLxDY8Q&t=961" target="_blank">00:16:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">looked inside them to see things like induction heads a lot of the cognitive machinery that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Aa0iLxDY8Q&t=965" target="_blank">00:16:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">would need for active agents seems kind of already present in the base language models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Aa0iLxDY8Q&t=970" target="_blank">00:16:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm not quite as sure as I was before that we're missing the things that you know that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Aa0iLxDY8Q&t=976" target="_blank">00:16:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">we're missing enough of the things that you would need. I think today's models just probably aren't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Aa0iLxDY8Q&t=981" target="_blank">00:16:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">smart enough that we should worry about this too much but I'm not 100% sure about this and I do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Aa0iLxDY8Q&t=987" target="_blank">00:16:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">think the models will get in a year or two like this might be a very real concern.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Aa0iLxDY8Q&t=991" target="_blank">00:16:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">What would change if you found out that they are conscious?
