House hacking. I've done it many, many times. It's where you buy like a small multifamily property. Let's call it like a triplex, like three separate units, right? And they're all over the country, all over the world. Every country's got them. And you live in one of the units and then you rent the other ones out.</p><p>Now you don't even have to be the property manager. You can even hire management so you don't deal with the tenants. But the benefit is one, you can get into these deals for very low money down, like 3%, 4%, 5% down when you're willing to live in the property for at least a year.</p><p>So let's just say you're somebody you've, you've saved up 20 grand. Well, what's 20 grand really going to do for you, right? You throw it into the stock market and you make yourself 10% on your 20 grand. Okay, good. You're now making $2,000 a year. It's not life-changing money, but that same 20 grand, if you were to buy that duplex or triplex, you could be living for free and saving what you'd be paying on rent somewhere else.</p><p>You can be saving a thousand, 2000, $3,000 a month and building equity at the same time.</p></div></div></body></html>
