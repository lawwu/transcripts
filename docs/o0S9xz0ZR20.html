One, how is sex between a husband and a wife a practical example of Christ and His church?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=42" target="_blank">00:00:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Number two, why is this truth something so many are so uncomfortable with?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=48" target="_blank">00:00:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I am not blushing, and I'm excited. I like this question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=52" target="_blank">00:00:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, in answer to the second question, "Why is this truth something many are uncomfortable with?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=61" target="_blank">00:01:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">My guess is there are at least three reasons. There are probably more, but here are my three.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=65" target="_blank">00:01:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Number one is that we don't have a robust enough vision of the beauty and depth and sacredness of the actual event of sexual intercourse as God designed it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=77" target="_blank">00:01:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Number two, our own experience of sexuality is so tainted with selfishness and pornographic corruption, either in our head or in the media, that we can scarcely have a thought about sex without the presence of those corruptions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And to be fair, there's a third factor that creates discomfort.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=99" target="_blank">00:01:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Very often, when this comes up, there may be children present. I'm thinking of a worship service, for example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Or a sensitive older person who's just not at all comfortable with saying some of the things I'm going to say in this answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=114" target="_blank">00:01:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Or single people or divorced people or somebody else who just, for various reasons, might be really put in an awkward position by explicit talk about what happens in the marriage bed and its relationship to the relationship of Christ in His church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So for those three reasons, our theology of marital intercourse is lame, our experience of sex is tainted, and our situations in which we speak about this often have audiences that make it awkward for them to hear, if not for us to speak.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I want us to have some patience, you know, and mercy upon pastors who might appear like they're awkward. Maybe they're not awkward for valid, I mean, deep reasons, but maybe for more audience-oriented reasons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, before I say anything about the answer to the first question, like, what is the real analogy here?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Let me draw the text out that Hannah is referring to so we get at least some of it on the table because I'm sure some listeners are just not familiar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's the Bible portion that she's talking about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her, that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the Word, so that he might present the church to himself."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So he's going after a bride. "In splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and without blemish."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In other words, Christ is after a beautiful, splendid, spotless, wrinkle-free, holy, blemish-free, gorgeous wife.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, verses 31 and 32, "Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's in the sexual act of intercourse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Verse 32, "This mystery," this union, this leaving, cleaving, and sexual union, "This mystery is profound. I am saying it refers to Christ and the church."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, there it is. There it is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The one-flesh union of man and wife are Christ and the church in emblem, in metaphor, in foretaste.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, let's just make it as explicit as we can, you could stir in here the Song of Solomon,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">where the sexual pleasures of the man and his wife are described with such remarkable graphicness, we have to blink and say, "Is this the Bible?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">For example, chapter 7, verse 7, he says to her, "Your stature is like a palm tree, and your breasts are like its clusters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I say I will climb the palm tree and lay hold of its fruit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, may your breasts be like clusters of the vine, and the scent of your breath like apples."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so that is the whole Bible portrayal of the marriage bed that Christ and the church are being pointed to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=328" target="_blank">00:05:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, for those familiar with the Bible, not to mention ordinary experience of married couples,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">we cannot escape the truth that Jesus is not ashamed to describe his relationship to the church in terms of a marriage,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">including its one-flesh union in the sexual act of the marriage bed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, Hannah asks, here's the first question, "How is sex between a husband and a wife a practical example of Christ and his church?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'll mention three things, and I do not doubt that these are the lowlands of the Himalayas of glory that better people than I could climb into and explain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=379" target="_blank">00:06:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Number one, very prominent in Ephesians 5 is the asymmetry, lack of symmetry, between the roles of husband and wife.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=391" target="_blank">00:06:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">She is to submit to his Christlike, loving, sacrificial headship.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=398" target="_blank">00:06:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But there is, just as clearly, a mutuality and reciprocity in seeking to bless and satisfy the other as leadership and submission find their way toward maximum mutual pleasure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=417" target="_blank">00:06:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In 1 Corinthians 7, Christ says that the man does not have authority over his body, but the woman does, and the woman does not have authority over her body, but the man does,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=430" target="_blank">00:07:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">which creates, if you're a logic chopper, a total stalemate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=435" target="_blank">00:07:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But Paul clearly doesn't mean for there to be a stalemate in the marriage bed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=440" target="_blank">00:07:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The point is that the wife often desires, has desires, and the husband in love should want to satisfy them and labor to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=454" target="_blank">00:07:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the husband often has desires, and the wife in love should want to satisfy them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=463" target="_blank">00:07:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But as they proceed, the way the man pursues the satisfying of his wife is in the capacity of a head and the initiative taker.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=474" target="_blank">00:07:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this doesn't rule out her own particular kinds of initiatives, but it does set the tone and establish a context in which he is felt to be the strong, caring, loving, creative leader in this event,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=492" target="_blank">00:08:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">which is what Christ and the Church are about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=496" target="_blank">00:08:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so my first answer is that in the act of sexual relations in marriage, the beauty and the complexity and the mystery of headship and submission in their most satisfying expressions are being realized.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=514" target="_blank">00:08:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Number two, the second thing I would say is that the reason the rare and extraordinary pleasure of simultaneous orgasm is as great as it is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=533" target="_blank">00:08:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is not only to point us to the ecstasies of knowing Christ, but also to give us a very taste of those ecstasies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=545" target="_blank">00:09:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When Jesus says that he is the bread of life, he means for us to taste something of his life in our favorite bread.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=556" target="_blank">00:09:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Some good German bakery.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=560" target="_blank">00:09:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The pleasure of the emblem, when it is consecrated to God, becomes a foretaste and a pleasure of the thing itself, Christ in the bread.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=574" target="_blank">00:09:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it is with the pleasures of the marriage bed as an emblem of Christ and the Church in fellowship.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=581" target="_blank">00:09:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When a couple loves each other and brings that love to climax in sexual consummation and lie there still restful, thankful at the end,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=595" target="_blank">00:09:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">their hearts should be brimming with how wonderful Jesus Christ is, that he would give them such pleasures and that he would show them in those pleasures what he is like and how precious is the Church's relationship to her husband.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=619" target="_blank">00:10:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Number three, I would say that the metaphors in general are always lesser realities than what they are metaphors of.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=632" target="_blank">00:10:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So a wedding ring is precious. I still have mine on. I think I've only had it off two days because of surgery and something else in 46 years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=642" target="_blank">00:10:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So my wedding ring is precious to me. A wedding ring is precious, but it's not as precious as the marriage and the pleasures of the marriage that it signifies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=652" target="_blank">00:10:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And sexual pleasure in marriage is precious, but not as precious as what it signifies in relation to Jesus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=661" target="_blank">00:11:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Jesus said that in the age to come there will be no marriage or giving in marriage. Now that may seem like a colossal disappointment for those of us who have enjoyed the pleasures of the marriage bed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=681" target="_blank">00:11:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But what if someone said, "In the future, I'm going to take away your wedding ring, and all you're going to have is heightened ecstasies that it stood for."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S9xz0ZR20&t=695" target="_blank">00:11:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Would you be disappointed?
