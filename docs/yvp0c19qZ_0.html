here briefly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=22" target="_blank">00:00:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">There's some music blaring, I would say, from the restaurant below.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=28" target="_blank">00:00:28.760</a></span> | <span

just had an audio engineer out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=50" target="_blank">00:00:50.180</a></span> | <span class="t">here last week helping us get rid of this ringing that was picking up in the equipment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=57" target="_blank">00:00:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And it turned out that the building itself has a faulty ground.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=64" target="_blank">00:01:04.280</a></span> | <span class="t">If you don't properly ground the electrical system in a building, the wires become antennas.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=70" target="_blank">00:01:10.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So this entire building is basically RF emitting antennas or RF gathering antennas.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=76" target="_blank">00:01:16.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, Joe was able to take a, what do you call it, impedance booster and plug it onto</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=81" target="_blank">00:01:21.820</a></span> | <span class="t">our mic cable and we could hear AM radio in our headsets because the wire on the mic was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=87" target="_blank">00:01:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">acting as an antenna and the sound was coming in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have our whole building is an antenna and there's techno music playing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the third fun thing is, as it took Jesse a while to get used to this, weird smell</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Fridays.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=104" target="_blank">00:01:44.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Like every once in a while, just weird smells come from the kitchen below and fill the studio.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Like I don't think in good conscience we could have former president Barack Obama come be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.220</a></span> | <span class="t">interviewed in here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">This would be my concern.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=117" target="_blank">00:01:57.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I was going to suggest he might need to get a cleaning lady, but then I realized it wasn't,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.560</a></span> | <span class="t">it was from coming from downstairs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=123" target="_blank">00:02:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know if that's better or worse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So anyways, it's, we, we love the HQ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=129" target="_blank">00:02:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">It's an odd HQ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.720</a></span> | <span class="t">We've made some progress on the ringing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Joe the engineer did some stuff that I think got rid of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=138" target="_blank">00:02:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think we're, I think we're okay, but he felt very tentative about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">You could tell someone at his caliber of audio engineering was very uncomfortable about the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">idea of trying to record anything high end in this location.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it made him physically uncomfortable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Well you should explain to the audience about, cause you do everything in one take and how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you were hearing this ringing in the back of your mic or headphones while you were recording.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So I could hear it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So we do things one take.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So I could hear it going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">But then once the podcasts were going out, podcast listeners weren't hearing it so much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And I, and I think it's because there's so much of the high end frequencies are cut off</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.760</a></span> | <span class="t">in the compression for the podcast apps and then going through the wireless connection</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.280</a></span> | <span class="t">to earbuds that like most people listening didn't really hear it.</span></div><div

YouTube on computers and I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the sound is less compressed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">They could hear it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And we started hearing from people, Hey, what's that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What's that ringing?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What's that?</span></div><div

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't understand it.</span></div><div class="c"><span

think Jesse, the only answer is we have to build a building somewhere.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think the power company is going to come out or the power company could fix the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">power in this room.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.040</a></span> | <span class="t">But I like our second option of we build the building built from the ground up with like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.200</a></span> | <span class="t">a beautiful power supply and a

target="_blank">00:03:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And if we do that, we have to get Joe the engineer somehow we have to steal him away</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

things like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=358" target="_blank">00:05:58.360</a></span> | <span class="t">structure and what caught my attention among other things when I was reading it is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=361"

the 60s, so he had a long period</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=375" target="_blank">00:06:15.320</a></span> | <span class="t">before

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So he would go through the notebooks and type up on his typewriter—remember, pre-computer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=428" target="_blank">00:07:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">era—type up on his

<span class="t">Then he would go to those tapes, and he would transcribe everything that was recorded on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=439" target="_blank">00:07:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">those tapes, all of the interviews and conversations on those tapes.</span></div><div

target="_blank">00:07:30.520</a></span> | <span class="t">enough that you could keep up when you're typing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=452" target="_blank">00:07:32.440</a></span> | <span class="t">This used to be real common back when dictation was used.</span></div><div

blocks of notes would be separated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=461" target="_blank">00:07:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">with multiple blank lines.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=464" target="_blank">00:07:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So okay, here's some notes from one conversation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=466" target="_blank">00:07:46.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Now here's some notes about something else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=468" target="_blank">00:07:48.280</a></span> | <span

reason why he would do that is that after he had laboriously typed up all of this—and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=473" target="_blank">00:07:53.800</a></span> | <span class="t">we're talking weeks and weeks of work—he would Xerox copy every one of those pages,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=479" target="_blank">00:07:59.120</a></span> | <span class="t">take the Xerox copies, and cut out each of those blocks.</span></div><div

would cut out strips from these pages</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=489" target="_blank">00:08:09.200</a></span> | <span

| <span class="t">So he would just have endless slips of paper, each piece of paper with a separate piece</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=497" target="_blank">00:08:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">of conversation or observation or note that he had took.</span></div><div

put them all into a folder dedicated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=504" target="_blank">00:08:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">to that topic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=505" target="_blank">00:08:25.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So now he would have, after weeks of work, dozens of folders, each dedicated to a particular</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=511"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=515" target="_blank">00:08:35.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And the folder would be full of all of his notes he had taken anywhere relevant to that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=521" target="_blank">00:08:41.880</a></span> | <span class="t">topic.</span></div><div

be an index card, he didn't specify—and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=527" target="_blank">00:08:47.520</a></span> | <span

there's a semantic issue that we often have on the show, let's get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=1349" target="_blank">00:22:29.380</a></span> | <span class="t">back to, which is what exactly do we mean by deep work?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=1354" target="_blank">00:22:34.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Because again, I talk about this all the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span

to originally apply.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=1364" target="_blank">00:22:44.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So really, the intention behind the phrase deep work is very focused.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=1368" target="_blank">00:22:48.300</a></span> | <span class="t">It is when you're doing a specific type of cognitive heavy work, it is a mode of doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=1374" target="_blank">00:22:54.980</a></span> | <span class="t">that work in which you minimize back and forth context switching.</span></div><div

being that if you have a hard cognitive task to do, giving that sustained</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=1389" target="_blank">00:23:09.020</a></span> | <span class="t">attention without context shifting is going to be more effective than trying to work on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=1392" target="_blank">00:23:12.700</a></span> | <span class="t">that task while also switching your attention back and forth.</span></div><div

is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=1398" target="_blank">00:23:18.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the larger hypothesis in the book Deep Work is that this is broadly valuable</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=1406" target="_blank">00:23:26.180</a></span> | <span class="t">in a lot of knowledge work fields, and it's becoming more valuable in a lot of knowledge</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=1410" target="_blank">00:23:30.020</a></span> | <span class="t">work fields, especially in the American context.</span></div><div class="c"><span

effect of requiring</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=1420" target="_blank">00:23:40.540</a></span> | <span class="t">lots of context switching, requiring lots of time fragmenting, make it very difficult</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=1425" target="_blank">00:23:45.260</a></span> | <span class="t">to actually work on cognitive tasks in this manner.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=1427" target="_blank">00:23:47.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So we execute those tasks worse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=1429" target="_blank">00:23:49.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the argument is we should actually prioritize in that work context, giving people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=1436" target="_blank">00:23:56.220</a></span> | <span class="t">unbroken time to work without

relevance if you're asking about, I'm at home, I'm at home</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=1447"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvp0c19qZ_0&t=1452" target="_blank">00:24:12.740</a></span> | <span class="t">of very specific cognitively demanding work tasks.</span></div><div class="c"><span
