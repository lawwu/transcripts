But does one of them seem a different category than the other to you? Or is it basically is that all included in the venture stuff you're interested in?</p><p>It's a little bit like saying should I should we fund a Thomas Edison or Beethoven get push comes to shove, and we can only find one of them, we probably should find Edison and not Beethoven, right? Like indoor lighting is probably more important than like music. I don't want to live without Beethoven, right?</p><p>This actually I think is a very important point, the point of the world, right? There's lots and lots of people trying to figure out the point of human existence, religions and philosophies and so forth. But what they all have in common is right other than maybe Marxism, what they all have in common is we're not just here to get up in the morning, work in a factory all day, go home at night, be depressed and sad, go to bed, like we're not, it's not we don't, we're not just material, right?</p><p>Whatever this is all about, like it's not just about materiality. There are higher aspirations and higher goals, right? And we create art, we create literature, we create paintings, we create sculptures, we create like aesthetics, We create fashion.</p></div></div></body></html>
