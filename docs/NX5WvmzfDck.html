Yeah. That's a short answer. Great. Yeah, yeah. So I'll put some parameters around it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=42" target="_blank">00:00:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">right?

If we look at intermittent fasting where you're holding the fast up till noon or you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=69" target="_blank">00:01:09.560</a></span> | <span class="t">having days of really low calorie restriction, we see in active women it's very detrimental</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=75" target="_blank">00:01:15.720</a></span> | <span class="t">unless you have PCOS or you have some other subclinical issue. And the reason for that is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.360</a></span> | <span class="t">we as women have more oxidative fibers. So we hear about all the things about fasting to improve our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.200</a></span> | <span class="t">metabolic flexibility, to improve telomere length, to improve parasympathetic activation. But by the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">nature of women having more oxidative fibers, we are already metabolically more flexible than men.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Interesting. I didn't know that. Could you elaborate on more oxidative fibers, what that is and how it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.040</a></span> | <span class="t">relates to metabolic flexibility?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Sure, sure. So oxidative fibers are muscle fibers that are more aerobic capacity. So those are the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=118" target="_blank">00:01:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">ones that you can go long and slow for a very long period of time because it uses a lot of free fatty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=124" target="_blank">00:02:04.640</a></span> | <span class="t">acids. You need a little bit of glucose in order to activate those free fatty acids. So when we look,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.220</a></span> | <span class="t">when a woman starts to exercise, she goes through blood glucose first and then gets into free fatty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.700</a></span> | <span class="t">acid use, she doesn't tap so much into liver muscle glycogen, which is, I think, another misconception</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=139" target="_blank">00:02:19.860</a></span> | <span class="t">that happens. So when we're talking about fasting or fasted workouts, trying to improve that metabolic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.300</a></span> | <span class="t">flexibility, it increases stress on the woman. And so when we're talking about overall stress, we're talking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">about cortisol increase and they can't hit intensities high enough with no fuel to be able to invoke the post-exercise</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.120</a></span> | <span class="t">responses of growth hormone and testosterone, which then drop cortisol. So from an overall stress perspective, that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">fasted workout and holding that fast for a long period of time increases cortisol. But then when we look from like a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.460</a></span> | <span class="t">hypothalamic point of view and we're looking at how the brain reads it, we know that there's one area of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.300</a></span> | <span class="t">kispeptin neurons in the brain for men, but there are two for women. So the two areas are distinct where one controls</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.340</a></span> | <span class="t">appetite and luteinizing hormone and the other one is looking at estrogen and thyroid. So if you start having an exercise</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.480</a></span> | <span class="t">stress or a daily stress of getting up and going on with your day without fuel, you perturb those kispeptin neurons and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.900</a></span> | <span class="t">downregulate them. And so when you start downregulating them, we see that after four days, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.780</a></span> | <span class="t">have a dysregulation of thyroid. We have a change in our luteinizing hormone pulse, which is really important</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.040</a></span> | <span class="t">to maintain endocrine function. And we'll hear this, oh, I've been fasting for so many years and it does</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.140</a></span> | <span class="t">great for me. But the other side of the question is, well, how much better would you be if you were to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">actually pay attention to your circadian rhythm and fuel according to the stress at hand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.260</a></span> | <span class="t">and knowing that you're going to garner less stress that way? And if we're really tying in nutrition</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.720</a></span> | <span class="t">according to that profile, instead of following a fast, we see better brain improvements as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.220</a></span> | <span class="t">We see more cognitive function. We see less thyroid dysfunction. And overall, a woman does much better</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">when we're not in that fasted state. Then when you look at population research that's coming out now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.260</a></span> | <span class="t">they're showing in both men and women who hold their fast till noon and then have an eating window from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.900</a></span> | <span class="t">noon to maybe 6pm have more obesogenic outcomes than people who break their fast at 8 and finished</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.080</a></span> | <span class="t">their eating window by 4 or 5pm. So it's coming back to the chronobiology of we need to eat when our body</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.660</a></span> | <span class="t">is under stress and needs it. Unless we have a specific issue like obesity, inactivity, PCOS,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.820</a></span> | <span class="t">or other metabolic conditions, then we can look at using fasting as a strategic intervention to help</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.720</a></span> | <span class="t">with those modalities. Super interesting. Two questions. Is there a protective effect of starting the eating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=302" target="_blank">00:05:02.040</a></span> | <span class="t">window, and here I'm asking for both men and women, starting the eating window at say 11am or noon and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.980</a></span> | <span class="t">ending it a little bit later? So not a six hour eating window or seven hour eating window, but extending</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.260</a></span> | <span class="t">that to 8 or 9pm. Under those conditions, do you still see the obesogenic effect?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=319" target="_blank">00:05:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, because we're looking at the way cortisol responds. We know cortisol has lots of fluctuations</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.020</a></span> | <span class="t">throughout the day, and it peaks about half an hour after you wake up, right? So if you're having that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.460</a></span> | <span class="t">cortisol peak half an hour after you wake up, but you're not eating, then that is that higher baseline</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">sympathetic drive for women. For men, it's not the same. So when we're looking at that obesogenic outcome,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.860</a></span> | <span class="t">the actual timing hasn't been tested yet to see how can we expand or contract that eating window for men.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But for women, because of that cortisol peak, that right after waking up, women tend to be already</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.620</a></span> | <span class="t">sympathetically driven. So then they walk around more tired, but wired, and have a really, really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.420</a></span> | <span class="t">difficult time accessing any kind of parasympathetic responses down the way. Where if you have something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=371" target="_blank">00:06:11.320</a></span> | <span class="t">really small, where you're bringing blood sugar up, then it's signaling to the hypothalamus, hey, yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=375" target="_blank">00:06:15.540</a></span> | <span class="t">there's some nutrition on board, then we can start our day.

Exactly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=434" target="_blank">00:07:14.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And I have to imagine that if she also is drinking caffeine in order to do that training, because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=443" target="_blank">00:07:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">caffeine is a stimulant of the sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system, that it will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=448" target="_blank">00:07:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">further exacerbate all these issues. So this is an eye-opener for me, because I've had female</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=456" target="_blank">00:07:36.340</a></span> | <span class="t">training partners for years. I don't eat until 11 a.m. I like to hydrate and caffeinate before I train</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=462" target="_blank">00:07:42.740</a></span> | <span class="t">in the morning, and then I like to eat starting around noon. Several of them have hopped on that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=468" target="_blank">00:07:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">schedule with me. Some of them eat breakfast first, some of them don't. They do as they choose,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=472" target="_blank">00:07:52.680</a></span> | <span class="t">of course. But now I'm thinking that's probably the worst way to go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=479" target="_blank">00:07:59.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And it gets worse as you get older, because if we're seeing as women are getting into perimenopause,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=484" target="_blank">00:08:04.220</a></span> | <span class="t">which is in their 40s, and we have more fluctuation of those hormones and an increase in baseline</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=490" target="_blank">00:08:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">cortisol anyway, then when you look at fasted training, it increases that cortisol drive and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=497" target="_blank">00:08:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">that sympathetic drive. And because it's a point where you really need to polarize your training</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=503" target="_blank">00:08:23.740</a></span> | <span class="t">to get any kind of body composition change, not having any fuel before high intensity workout puts</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=510" target="_blank">00:08:30.140</a></span> | <span class="t">them in moderate intensity.

So you have two reps</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX5WvmzfDck&t=526" target="_blank">00:08:46.140</a></span> | <span class="t">in reserve and a sessional RPE of an eight.
