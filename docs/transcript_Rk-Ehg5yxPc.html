But as I was reading the comments on Doctor of Credit, I noticed that everyone in the comments said, this is a terrible deal. Yes, AllTrails might normally be $50. Yes, it's on sale for $20.</p><p>But don't forget that their pricing is country specific. So if you're currently traveling in India, you could get AllTrails for much less than $20. I think it was something like $5 or $6. And also, did you know that you can use a VPN to see that? And it just got me thinking, should I be using a VPN to basically not just sometimes price shop flights, which I've done in the past, but also to go and price shop anything I'm buying to see if the price is better?</p><p>That's something I'm going to add to my routine of all of the things I do before I'm shopping online, because I thought it was pretty cool.</p></div></div></body></html>
