in order to understand it and unpack it, I think it's important to explain exactly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEee7dAk25c&t=460"

every venture capitalist started telling or I would say the overwhelming majority</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEee7dAk25c&t=503"

that they owe their liabilities, which is what they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEee7dAk25c&t=565" target="_blank">00:09:25.040</a></span> |

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEee7dAk25c&t=571" target="_blank">00:09:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So that sits as a liability.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEee7dAk25c&t=573" target="_blank">00:09:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And then they had some other debt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEee7dAk25c&t=574" target="_blank">00:09:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So in total, Silicon Valley Bank at the end of the year had about $195 billion in liabilities,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEee7dAk25c&t=580" target="_blank">00:09:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">173 billion of customer

target="_blank">00:09:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And then they take those customer deposits and they invest it in a number of securities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEee7dAk25c&t=590" target="_blank">00:09:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And the way that a balance sheet business like this bank would operate is, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEee7dAk25c&t=594" target="_blank">00:09:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the customers have access to their cash anytime they want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEee7dAk25c&t=598" target="_blank">00:09:58.720</a></span> | <span class="t">But in order for the bank to make money, they make longer duration investments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEee7dAk25c&t=602" target="_blank">00:10:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And those longer duration investments give them the ability to earn money on those longer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEee7dAk25c&t=606" target="_blank">00:10:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">duration investments, more than they're paying the customers for the

duration investments, they had about $208 billion</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEee7dAk25c&t=614" target="_blank">00:10:14.880</a></span> | <span

<span class="t">So compare that to the 195 billion that they owe customers and other debt holders.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEee7dAk25c&t=624" target="_blank">00:10:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, the difference here between 208 and 195 is about $13
