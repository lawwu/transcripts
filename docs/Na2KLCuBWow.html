This one is hard because I feel like this is a daily constant war for me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2KLCuBWow&t=66" target="_blank">00:01:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I think when I got married and when I had children, the war got harder. And that's not to say that in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2KLCuBWow&t=74" target="_blank">00:01:14.240</a></span> | <span class="t">singleness is not, but I feel like I had more meaningful distractions. And what I mean by that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2KLCuBWow&t=81" target="_blank">00:01:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">is when I was single, I kind of just, you know, I just had work, you know, I just woke up kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2KLCuBWow&t=88" target="_blank">00:01:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">when I wanted to wake up because I was self-employed. You know, I could spend the time of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2KLCuBWow&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the world for like an hour if I chose to. Now it's if I need to, if I want to spend uninterrupted time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2KLCuBWow&t=100" target="_blank">00:01:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">with God, I need to wake up before my children do. And so stuff like that. So I think the war is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2KLCuBWow&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.600</a></span> | <span class="t">man, do I make time for God or do I try to fit God into the time that I feel like I already don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2KLCuBWow&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">have? And so when I wake up, it's a daily decision. And I think one of my mistakes is, I know this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2KLCuBWow&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.120</a></span> | <span class="t">personally, is that I sleep with my phone. I know for a fact, if I got rid of my phone, my distractions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2KLCuBWow&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">would be not as close or nearby. And so I think what's at stake ultimately is my love of the Lord.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2KLCuBWow&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I was thinking about this yesterday at church when our pastor, he caught on to Beatitudes and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2KLCuBWow&t=139" target="_blank">00:02:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">he talked about how, you know, blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness. And he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2KLCuBWow&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">was, he was rooting his text and our love for God and our love for the word. And the thought that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2KLCuBWow&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">came to my mind is if I'm not delighting in the word of God, then most likely I'm not delighting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2KLCuBWow&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">in God himself. And so I think that's ultimately is at stake is my affections. What are my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2KLCuBWow&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">affections in? If my affections are in my sleep, then I'm going to treasure sleep over the word.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2KLCuBWow&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">If my affections are in my emails, then I'm going to treasure my emails over the word. If my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2KLCuBWow&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">affections are in my time, then my time is going to be preeminent over the preeminent one. And so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2KLCuBWow&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I think identifying what really is my joy, is it God? Is it my stuff? Is it my peace or what I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2KLCuBWow&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">is peace? Because I'm able to sit up and watch Netflix when I could be reading Psalms. I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2KLCuBWow&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">identifying those things that are really legitimately good things and opportunities</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2KLCuBWow&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">for leisure that I've made an idol in many ways. And so, yeah, what's at stake is me and Jesus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2KLCuBWow&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">being good. What's the impulse online that you feel? How does it manifest in your life?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2KLCuBWow&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's, I love information. And so before I go to bed, one of my things before I go to bed is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2KLCuBWow&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I tend to just Wikipedia random things. So it's like...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2KLCuBWow&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, give us an example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2KLCuBWow&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So for example, there was this show, I think it's called Genius on National Geographic,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2KLCuBWow&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and it was about Picasso. I was like, "Huh, I wonder, I just want to know his name. I want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2KLCuBWow&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">to know where he's from. I want to know when he started painting." And then I realized he had</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2KLCuBWow&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">13 names in his name. And so I just go on this rabbit trail where I'm Wikipedian facts about,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2KLCuBWow&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Wikipedian, whatever. I'm on Wikipedia learning about people. So when I wake up, that information,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2KLCuBWow&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">that desire for information is still there. It just tends to lean towards wanting information</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2KLCuBWow&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.120</a></span> | <span class="t">from secular sources. And so what does Twitter have to say today? What's the news? Oh, LeBron</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2KLCuBWow&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">got signed to LA. I wonder how much he made. Like my mind is just wondering about everything that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2KLCuBWow&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">happened while I was asleep instead of waking up to wonder about the glory of God and his</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2KLCuBWow&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">scriptures. And so I think that's something that I need to consistently, have to consistently kill,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2KLCuBWow&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is this desire to esteem the new information over the lasting information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2KLCuBWow&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">This is good. So what else can we learn from Jackie Hill Perry about social media in this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2KLCuBWow&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">fight in the mornings?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2KLCuBWow&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Man, you wrote a great book about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2KLCuBWow&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think it's our hearts. I actually asked a friend of mine from church. She is nearing her</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2KLCuBWow&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">forties. And I wanted to know, I said, like in your, when, like in the eighties and stuff like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2KLCuBWow&t=302" target="_blank">00:05:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that, when you were around, I know that distractions haven't necessarily, distractions aren't a new</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2KLCuBWow&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">thing. They just transform and they, you know, do that. I was like, so what was the distraction for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2KLCuBWow&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">you guys? She was like TV. She was like, there was this, there was this influx of sitcoms and VHS</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2KLCuBWow&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">tapes and all of this type of stuff that we were just consuming on a daily basis. And I was like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2KLCuBWow&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">huh. And so I think ultimately we have to learn how to navigate this world that we're in with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2KLCuBWow&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">distractions as a whole, and just see that like, man, this will, this will subtly take our attention</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2KLCuBWow&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">away from God if we let it. But I think as we, as we learn to love God more, it really becomes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2KLCuBWow&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">easier to resist. I think it's as simple as that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2KLCuBWow&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So true. Yeah. I'm thinking of the parable of the four soils. I mean, the desire for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2KLCuBWow&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">riches has always been a distraction to the gospel. I mean, since the dawn of time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2KLCuBWow&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">even before the media age. That's real true.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na2KLCuBWow&t=356" target="_blank">00:05:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Jackie, this has been a short, but wonderful week with you.
