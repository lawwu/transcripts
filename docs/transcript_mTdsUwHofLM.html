He was a communist empathizer, right? He had been during the 1930s, but less for the theory, if you will, than for the practical business of helping Jews escape from Nazi Germany.</p><p>One of the loves of his life, who was busy working on extracting Jews from Europe during the '30s as well, was a member of the Communist Party, Jean Tadlock. And she, I think, encouraged him to come to meetings. But I don't think there's any possibility whatsoever that he either shared information or was in any way affiliated.</p><p>In fact, he said he read Marx on a train trip, people traveled by train in those days, between Berkeley and Washington one time and thought it was a bunch of hooey. Just ridiculous. He was a very smart man and he read the book with an eye to its logic and he didn't think there was much there.</p><p>So I think you have to see him as, you know, he really didn't know anything about human beings and their struggles. He was born into considerable wealth. There were Impressionist paintings all over his family apartments in New York City. His father had made a great deal of money cornering the market, so to speak, on uniform linings for military uniforms during and before the First World War.</p><p>So there was a lot of wealth. I think his income, if I remember and if I'm right in this, when he was during the war years and before, was somewhere around $100,000 a month. And that's a lot of money in the 1930s. So he just lived in his head for most of his early, early years until he got to Berkeley and discovered that prime students of his were living on cat food.</p><p>I mean, you know, cans of god-awful cat food because they couldn't afford anything else. And once he understood that there was great suffering in the world, he jumped in on it as he always did when he became interested in something. So all of those things come together. I do think his brother, well, there's no question that his brother, Frank, was a member of the party, as was Frank's wife.</p><p>And the whole question of Oppenheimers lying to the security people during the Second World War, which he did, about who approached him and who was maybe trying to get him to sign on to some espionage, I think was primarily an effort to cover up his brother's involvement. Not that his brothers gave away any secrets.</p><p>I don't think he did. But if the Army security had really understood Frank Oppenheimer's involvement, he probably would have been shipped off to the Aleutians or some other distant place for the duration of the war. And Oppenheimer, quite correctly, wanted Frank around. He was someone he trusted. you</p></div></div></body></html>
