And then forces a separate group of people to have those conversations and asks them what was that like? And it turns out that we vastly and systematically underestimate the value of all sorts of deep conversations.</p><p>Again, confiding, opening up, sharing information. People imagine that those conversations will be cringe and awkward and unproductive, maybe even damaging. I happen to be a runner and I often do not want to go on a run. I just don't want to do it. But then afterwards I'm glowing. I'm so glad that I did it.</p><p>And what I try to do is with my pre-run inertia to remind myself of what my future self will think. I think we should do that much more with our connections and conversations with each other as well because we are systematically underestimating their value.</p></div></div></body></html>
