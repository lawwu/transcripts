In 1989, Peter Bernstein, the legendary investor</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt0i_0pyM7U&t=787" target="_blank">00:13:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">who wrote Against the Gods, which is an amazing book on risk, laid out this idea in some investment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt0i_0pyM7U&t=792" target="_blank">00:13:12.360</a></span> | <span class="t">research journal type of periodical. He said, "What's the difference between a 60/40 portfolio</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt0i_0pyM7U&t=797" target="_blank">00:13:17.260</a></span> | <span class="t">of stocks and bonds versus 75% in stocks and 25% in cash?" And he said, "Although cash</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt0i_0pyM7U&t=801" target="_blank">00:13:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">tends to have lower expected returns in bonds, we have seen that cash can hold its own against</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt0i_0pyM7U&t=805" target="_blank">00:13:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">bonds 30% of the time or more when bond prices are positive, and cash will always win out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt0i_0pyM7U&t=809" target="_blank">00:13:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">over bonds when bond returns are negative." And that's now, right? So, that's why people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt0i_0pyM7U&t=814" target="_blank">00:13:34.360</a></span> | <span class="t">are probably more comfortable investing in cash right now. So, now, John, you can put</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt0i_0pyM7U&t=816" target="_blank">00:13:36.760</a></span> | <span class="t">this table that shows a 60/40 versus 75/25. And you can see -- so, I did that from 1928</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt0i_0pyM7U&t=823" target="_blank">00:13:43.160</a></span> | <span class="t">to 1921. You can see it's pretty similar. A little bit higher volatility in 75/25, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt0i_0pyM7U&t=827" target="_blank">00:13:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">higher returns as well. And then I also looked at the period of 1950 to 1981 to show, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt0i_0pyM7U&t=832" target="_blank">00:13:52.120</a></span> | <span class="t">what about a rising rate environment?

And you can see the 75/25 portfolio actually outperformed because cash outperformed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt0i_0pyM7U&t=841" target="_blank">00:14:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">bonds back then. Because you get the -- because short-term rates rise and you get to reinvest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt0i_0pyM7U&t=845" target="_blank">00:14:05.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and bonds have this interest rate risk. So, you get a little bit higher volatility having</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt0i_0pyM7U&t=850" target="_blank">00:14:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">more stocks, but then you have this piece in cash that you know is not going to fall</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt0i_0pyM7U&t=854" target="_blank">00:14:14.780</a></span> | <span class="t">on a nominal basis, right? In cash, in this instance, I used three-month T-bills, which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt0i_0pyM7U&t=858" target="_blank">00:14:18.920</a></span> | <span class="t">is basically like a savings account or money market. It is worth noting, Peter Bernstein</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt0i_0pyM7U&t=863" target="_blank">00:14:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">wrote this piece in 1989. Yields were much higher. 10-year yield averaged 8.5% in 1989.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt0i_0pyM7U&t=869" target="_blank">00:14:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Three-month T-bills sported an average yield of 8.4%. So, things were a tad easier from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt0i_0pyM7U&t=873" target="_blank">00:14:33.480</a></span> | <span class="t">an income perspective back then. Right now, three-month T-bills yield about .9% or 90</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt0i_0pyM7U&t=878" target="_blank">00:14:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">basis points, if we're talking finance-speak.

And again, that's not necessarily just because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt0i_0pyM7U&t=1359" target="_blank">00:22:39.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Jay Powell said, "We're going up 50 bps." It's just what the market is determining.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt0i_0pyM7U&t=1362" target="_blank">00:22:42.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Got to remember, though, he said we're not going to raise it by 75 bps next time.

I will say, in terms of what to invest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt0i_0pyM7U&t=1375" target="_blank">00:22:55.020</a></span> | <span class="t">in, a lot of this depends on, are you still going to use this for a down payment? So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt0i_0pyM7U&t=1379" target="_blank">00:22:59.060</a></span> | <span class="t">let's say you just extend it and you say, "Okay, we're not going to buy a house today,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt0i_0pyM7U&t=1381" target="_blank">00:23:01.660</a></span> | <span class="t">but maybe in three years or five years." So, I think you have to tie that time horizon</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt0i_0pyM7U&t=1384" target="_blank">00:23:04.380</a></span> | <span class="t">to this to figure out what you want to put it into. And that means something that's probably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt0i_0pyM7U&t=1388" target="_blank">00:23:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">relatively safe, even three to five years. As we've seen this year, we're four months</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt0i_0pyM7U&t=1392" target="_blank">00:23:12.340</a></span> | <span class="t">into the year and the stock market's down, I don't know, 14 or 15 percent. Some other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt0i_0pyM7U&t=1396" target="_blank">00:23:16.300</a></span> | <span class="t">stock market's down much more.
