All right. Final question is from Amy. She asked, how can I reset my ambitions after burning out? She's talking about how she's overwhelmed with her career, and she's trying to improve at that and she's fresh off of burnout and is lost on where to start.</p><p>It's a good question, because I don't think we, we don't get into this enough. Burnout and the sources of burnout, we don't get into that enough when we talk about optimistic, forward-looking discussions of productivity and planning, organization, et cetera. So let's, let's be clear here. You need to do, you know, your lifestyle-centric career planning.</p><p>That's the theme of this episode. Lifestyle-centric career planning is a great way. It's a theme of block two, at least. Know your vision, work backwards to figure out what to do with your career. Here's the key. Keep the sources of your burnout in mind when you construct that vision.</p><p>It should be your vision of an ideal life should keep in mind the things that really tax you, the things that tend to accumulate and lead to burnout. Your ideal life should be a life in which you're free from burnout. That has to be part of the vision. I think too often what people do is they invalidate the burnout and the things that lead to burnout.</p><p>Like that's malformed and successful people don't have that. And so my vision of what I'm trying to do with my life has to be one that ignores that. And it might be a vision that has all of the stressors, all of the anxiety triggers, all of the things that really don't match well with you and lead to burnout in it.</p><p>And that's not going to work. So build an ideal vision of a life should be a life without burnout, which means the things that cause the burnout should be largely absent from it. I do this. I do this with my own planning, my vision with which I think about my life because my body has this really clear, I talk about this a bunch on the show.</p><p>It has this really clear feedback mechanism on don't like where you're going, the workload, the type of work and it's insomnia. I have trouble sleeping when things get out of whack. That feedback mechanism, and that's my burnout. And that feedback mechanism has a huge impact on the vision of my life that I build.</p><p>I steer away from visions, especially the professional part of my life that are getting after it busy where it's a startup and it's like, let's go and we're going to just get after it and have all these different things going on and calls and meetings and we're going to move and we're going to build this thing big and make $20 million off of it.</p><p>I have to steer away from that because if I have too much going on and then I might start getting insomnia, it'd be very hard to keep up those hard schedules. It's a governor. So my vision doesn't involve that. Think about the visions that you see playing out of my own life.</p><p>They're all slow productivity related. It's all based on things that no particular single day matters. What matters is that over time, you're coming back again and again to work on this book. Over time, you're thinking deep thoughts. Hey, tomorrow, if you're tired, who cares? But this month, you spent a lot of days thinking about this paper.</p><p>You spent a lot of days working on this book. So I've constructed ideal vision that keeps explicitly in mind the specific things that lead to my sources of burnout, my particular definition of burnout. I think that's really important. If you get drained when you're not feeding off other people, you're very social, your family and friends are important, you better have a vision of your life in which you're not working 80 hours a week.</p><p>It's got to be a vision of your life where you live near family, where you spend a lot of time with community and friends. I'm going to give a specific example here. There's a writer whose book I read, and I feel bad because I forgot the name of it.</p><p>I think it's Donald Miller is his name. He had a self-help advice book. But anyways, the thing that I remember from that book is they bought a bunch of land outside of Nashville and built it. They wanted to be like a retreat center and a place where writers and musicians and artists they know could always be coming through and having retreats and working.</p><p>They could be outside a lot, work on the land a lot, have a lot of people they found really interesting there. It was a vision of success for this person in the world of business that really focused on what he needed. Probably this would be someone where 90 hours in their office at McKinsey, where you're not seeing anybody and you're just cut off and you and your spreadsheet would be immiserating.</p><p>Your vision is what I'm trying to say here, has to keep your sources of burnout in mind because your vision needs to be one in which burnout is infrequent and unexpected when it does happen. That's what I'm saying. I mean, so update your vision and it might require radical change.</p><p>If the source of your burnout is going to be unavoidable, you're in an academic department where there's acrimony through the roof and it just stresses you out and you can't get more than a semester or two without just it wearing you down, you might have to do something radically different.</p><p>You need a vision of your life in which that doesn't happen. I want to validate your burnout and say, use that in your planning.</p></div></div></body></html>
