diagnosis,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=302" target="_blank">00:05:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">partly because there isn't

unusual.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=322" target="_blank">00:05:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, with ADHD, they're all usual behaviors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just to an unusual extent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So the diagnosis comes under a lot of stigma and questioning, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.400</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:05:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So you mentioned that there can be a lot of environmental dependence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">One thing that I and I know a lot of people wonder about is with the advent of more people working</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=348" target="_blank">00:05:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">at home and certainly during lockdowns, kids were at home for school as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But is it the case that when somebody with ADHD is in their home environment where they're typically,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, more options of things to do that the symptoms get worse as opposed to when they go to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=370" target="_blank">00:06:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">say, a restaurant or to school or to play a sport or to work, where sure, there are multiple things you can do in those environments,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">but they're more constrained in terms of the different sides of oneself, the different activities that one tends to engage in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=387" target="_blank">00:06:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Is that common?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So back up a little bit that like all of our other mental health or psychiatric conditions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">there's clearly both a biological component to ADHD and clearly a social environment or the nature and nurture question isn't which is it, it's always both.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So with ADHD, we know there's a very strong genetic component.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=407" target="_blank">00:06:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">The heritability factor is around 0.8, which is about as strong as the heritability factor for height or for schizophrenia.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=415" target="_blank">00:06:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So does that mean that if you're an identical twin and your twin has ADHD,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=421" target="_blank">00:07:01.040</a></span> | <span class="t">that there's a sort of essentially a 0.8 probability that you'll have it as well?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=425" target="_blank">00:07:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Or is this through the-</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=426" target="_blank">00:07:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I mean, heritability is a little more technically sophisticated and it's about the variance due to-</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=433" target="_blank">00:07:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Sure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=433" target="_blank">00:07:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's high likelihood.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=435" target="_blank">00:07:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So this tends to run in families.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=438" target="_blank">00:07:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But again, it has a social, it's, you're not just a brain in the world, you're a brain interacting with the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=445" target="_blank">00:07:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And with ADHD, we like to frame it as both structure is important and demands are important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=452" target="_blank">00:07:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So one of the aspects of ADHD, separate from the official, how we categorize it in terms or diagnose it in terms of symptoms,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=460" target="_blank">00:07:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">we most often are understanding at this day and age as a problem with executive functions of the brain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=467" target="_blank">00:07:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">How the brain's working memory works, how selective attention works or doesn't work,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=472" target="_blank">00:07:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">how emotional regulation is working or not, how impulse control is working.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=477" target="_blank">00:07:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And essentially, the ADHD brain is less able to provide the structure it needs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=484" target="_blank">00:08:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's more reliant on an optimal structure in the outside world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=488" target="_blank">00:08:08.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So getting the home versus working in a work office environment, part of the problem is if you're in a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=497" target="_blank">00:08:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">traditional office environment, you know, you're starting a specific

into that, but I think there's an ADHD reason why it didn't go up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=624" target="_blank">00:10:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Nobody that I heard was mentioning that ADHD would go up, and part of it is because partly to hold on to its legitimacy as a real psychiatric diagnosis, both many patients and many researchers in the field, hold so strongly to, this is a biological condition.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=643" target="_blank">00:10:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Why would it change, you know, I mean, we can understand why PTSD, more people are

up, but there was no prediction, again, mostly because I think that the defensiveness of the ADHD community and not wanting to acknowledge as much that there's a real nurture component and not just a nature component.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=685" target="_blank">00:11:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And yet what we've seen just looking at prescriptions and, you know, the media has jumped all over this, not only have ADHD diagnosis gone up considerably, but also prescription stimulants have shot up dramatically in the last few years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=702" target="_blank">00:11:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I'd like to take a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=711" target="_blank">00:11:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I've spoken before on this podcast about the critical need for us to get adequate amounts of quality sleep each night.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=716" target="_blank">00:11:56.800</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=722" target="_blank">00:12:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep, your body temperature actually has to drop by about one to three degrees.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=729" target="_blank">00:12:09.120</a></span> |

target="_blank">00:14:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I realize it's very difficult to throw out kind of pan statements about what sorts of work and professions are going to be best for people

observation, can you perhaps point us to kind of clusters of professions where people with ADHD tend to gravitate toward because they have sufficient or even hyper proficiency there?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=906" target="_blank">00:15:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Like would we say like the creative arts where, you

target="_blank">00:15:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm using extreme kind of almost silly examples, but those are professions indeed versus a job where people have quote unquote bankers hours

with this, but I think it's one of the most insightful quips about ADHD is that non ADHD brains are importance driven.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=967" target="_blank">00:16:07.800</a></span> | <span class="t">The ADHD brain, in contrast, is an interest driven brain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=971" target="_blank">00:16:11.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So they know, yeah, yeah, yeah, I should be doing my

target="_blank">00:16:23.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So regarding career work, I think the most important thing is that it's interesting to you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=990" target="_blank">00:16:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So we can talk about realms of work or certain career paths, but if it's not compelling to you, if it's not interesting to you, it's going to be hard to work at it, even if it's structurally maybe a better support for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1008" target="_blank">00:16:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Does that carry over to other domains of life?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1011" target="_blank">00:16:51.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You see, for instance, that people with ADHD are, have a harder time with parenting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1017" target="_blank">00:16:57.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Not that kids aren't super interesting, but, you know, some of their activities might be less interesting to parents than others versus people who are just, I think of this word importance driven as just kind of like really dutiful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1030" target="_blank">00:17:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Like it's, it's, it, you do it because you're supposed to do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1034" target="_blank">00:17:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And part of how the field like actually in the nineties started becoming aware that adults could have ADHD is that all these clinicians who were having ADHD clinics for kids were starting to notice, wait a minute, this parent is showing up 20 minutes late to pick up his kid.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1052" target="_blank">00:17:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Wait a minute.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1053" target="_blank">00:17:33.800</a></span> | <span class="t">The parent didn't fill the prescription.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1056" target="_blank">00:17:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So the kid went for two weeks without the medication.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1059" target="_blank">00:17:39.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And they started becoming more aware of ADHD in adults by seeing that the adults who were parents of these kids, and again, there's a strong genetic connection, had ADHD.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1070" target="_blank">00:17:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So there are certainly wonderful, loving, supportive, nurturing parents with ADHD, but studies that have looked at, you know, trying to find some objective measures are things more likely to be forgotten, misplaced, mislaid, go off track with an ADHD family.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1091" target="_blank">00:18:11.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Absolutely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1092" target="_blank">00:18:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Absolutely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1093" target="_blank">00:18:13.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of the more powerful sets of interventions for kids with ADHD separate from medications is family-based training that helps get the whole family, one, to understand how the kid's brain is working differently, but actually it might not be that differently.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1107" target="_blank">00:18:27.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It might be exactly how dad or mom's brain is working, but to help them function as more consistent parents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1116" target="_blank">00:18:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So the other bias I'd say again before identifying specific careers is that as a society we've long cherished or valued, the guy who worked 50 years for Eastman Kodak Company and got the gold watch at the end was sort of the epitome of what you should strive for in a career.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1137" target="_blank">00:18:57.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you're interest-driven and your interests change, so for many people with ADHD, the best career is actually not one 50-year career, it's 10, five-year careers or five, 10-year careers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1152" target="_blank">00:19:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And part of it is the whole work world has become more fragmented and upheaval is the name of the game and break things quickly is the motto of Silicon Valley.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1164" target="_blank">00:19:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I didn't phrase that quite right, but the message I think is still there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1169" target="_blank">00:19:29.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I think we're accepting more that many career trajectories are going to look not like just one beautiful arc, but I think there's a sort of a normocentric bias to that is what you should strive for, and if you are changing careers, that's a bad thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1187" target="_blank">00:19:47.800</a></span> | <span class="t">We've got lots of people who do worthwhile things in life, and often because of their more varied experience, they're bringing more to what they're doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1196" target="_blank">00:19:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think we need to value that and embrace that as an option and accept that maybe for some people that is an optimal career path.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1206" target="_blank">00:20:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I can relate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1207" target="_blank">00:20:07.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, I spent 20-plus years training to become a bench scientist and run a lab, and then now I still teach and hold my appointment, still involved in a bit of research.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1216" target="_blank">00:20:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But I'm in a second career now-ish, and I imagine there'll be a third.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1223"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1226" target="_blank">00:20:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I certainly consume a lot of caffeine, and we'll come back to the idea of the relationship between levels of caffeine consumption and possible ADHD.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1236" target="_blank">00:20:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">We're seeding the discussion for later on that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1239" target="_blank">00:20:39.800</a></span> | <span class="t">We hear pretty often that social media and scrolling X or scrolling Instagram or TikTok is "giving people ADHD."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1250" target="_blank">00:20:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Are there any data, either clinical or otherwise, that suggests that the mere practice of looking at 10,000 different contexts, or even 15 videos for a minute while standing at the bus stop,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1266" target="_blank">00:21:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">is somehow creating more distractibility in other domains of life?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1273" target="_blank">00:21:13.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1274" target="_blank">00:21:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'd say there's a lot of good neuroscience research or neuropsychological data that the more time you spend immersed in social media, and it's the constant, it's the barrage of information and not just the volume of information, but that you are constantly being interrupted, and that most of these interruptions are intentionally designed to attract your attention.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1302" target="_blank">00:21:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And that the more people practice thinking that way or being in the world that way, yes, it's harder to sustain attention for long periods of time, that you train yourself to overreact to any new distractions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1320" target="_blank">00:22:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So the core elements of some of the executive functions that are impaired in ADHD, we are all becoming more ADHD-like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1329" target="_blank">00:22:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's the thesis of the book that I've been working on that's still several months from going anywhere.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1335" target="_blank">00:22:15.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But I call it attention deficit world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1338" target="_blank">00:22:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of the things that's been frustrating is that there's been this huge disconnect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1342" target="_blank">00:22:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">There have been people writing about, you know, the question you're asking, that the neuroscience, our brains getting more distracted, are we becoming, you know, it's not just distracted.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1352" target="_blank">00:22:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, immersion in this media world or social media, cell phone, however you want to break it down, it's not all bad.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1359" target="_blank">00:22:39.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not just that concentration's worse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1361" target="_blank">00:22:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, detecting visual items in the environment, there's some things that people become more adept at.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1370" target="_blank">00:22:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Whether that's actually a good thing to be more adept at, people do multitask more quickly or switch in and out of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1378" target="_blank">00:22:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">They're still not doing as well on that task if they had no distractions and just focus solely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1383" target="_blank">00:23:03.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But they're multitasking better than people who don't immerse themselves a lot in the internet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1388" target="_blank">00:23:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's a whole literature and popular books and attention.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1392" target="_blank">00:23:12.800</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:23:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But all the books that talk about that say, well, this is just sort of everyday stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1401" target="_blank">00:23:21.800</a></span> | <span class="t">This has nothing to do with ADHD.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1403" target="_blank">00:23:23.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's lots of wonderful ADHD books out there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1406" target="_blank">00:23:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And they'd say ADHD is this discreet condition, even if they acknowledge it's on a spectrum of severity,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1413" target="_blank">00:23:33.800</a></span> | <span

class="t">And we don't, you know, just because you forgot your homework or you left your car keys</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1423" target="_blank">00:23:43.800</a></span> | <span class="t">or you can't remember where you parked your car, everyone does that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1427" target="_blank">00:23:47.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And we want to make sure that you respect that ADHD is a serious and potentially disruptive condition.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1434" target="_blank">00:23:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And when I say serious, and I'm going to go on this tangent for a little bit,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1439" target="_blank">00:23:59.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the caricatures of ADHD is, you know, oh, there's the squirrel.</span></div><div

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1445" target="_blank">00:24:05.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It's people are distracted, ditzy, late, doing things that we make fun of in society.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1452" target="_blank">00:24:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And we ignore that many of these things can have a more serious repercussions inside.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1458" target="_blank">00:24:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So a kid who has ADHD, their life expectancy is about 10 years shorter than their non-ADHD peers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1466" target="_blank">00:24:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">That is the same extent of cutting off life as having diabetes or having major depression.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1472" target="_blank">00:24:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Is that because of accidents, addiction, injury?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1476" target="_blank">00:24:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Almost all of it is two factors and they're almost equally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1480" target="_blank">00:24:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">One is accidents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1481" target="_blank">00:24:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So motor vehicle accidents, you know, if you're driving distracted, you're more likely to be involved in accidents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1488" target="_blank">00:24:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's also, you know, the kid who's probably being more daring with the tractor on the farm or daring the bull.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1496" target="_blank">00:24:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, all sorts of accidents, not just motor vehicle accidents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1500" target="_blank">00:25:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And the other is suicide.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1503" target="_blank">00:25:03.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And some of the suicide is because there is an overlap with depression and anxiety and other factors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1510" target="_blank">00:25:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But I'm convinced and not many people are looking at this angle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1514" target="_blank">00:25:14.800</a></span> | <span

focus so much on the despair, the misery that someone hates their life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1520" target="_blank">00:25:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, but there's lots and lots of depressed people who don't kill themselves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1524" target="_blank">00:25:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">The other really important element to suicide is impulsivity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1530" target="_blank">00:25:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Is lots of people feel really bad, but we know having guns in households increases the rate of likelihood someone's going to shoot them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1540" target="_blank">00:25:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">There's accessibility to tools that you can quickly use to kill yourself, which shows if you slow down the thinking process, if you give people more time, if they are less impulsive, they are less likely to kill them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1554" target="_blank">00:25:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">They still might be miserable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1556" target="_blank">00:25:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's my explanation for why, even though during COVID lockdowns, we did see increases in depression, we did see increases of PTSD, we did see increases in domestic abuse and battering, and we saw actually a decrease in suicide during that time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1575" target="_blank">00:26:15.800</a></span> | <span class="t">How does that make any sense?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1577" target="_blank">00:26:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And it wasn't huge, but since suicide's been going up every year prior to that, it's pretty clear and blatant in the data and remarkable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1586" target="_blank">00:26:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And my claim is so many more people were at home, you know, your kid's not around to play with the gun or find the gun or, you know, you know what's going on or poison or hanging themselves from the door or whatever else they might do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1600" target="_blank">00:26:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Very interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1602" target="_blank">00:26:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I didn't realize that ADHD carried this lifespan liability.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1608" target="_blank">00:26:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And 10 years is certainly significant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1611" target="_blank">00:26:51.800</a></span> | <span class="t">There's also the middle ground.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1612" target="_blank">00:26:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So I sort of mentioned that the caricature is sort of the silliness and the trivial of being late for your friends at the restaurant or forgetting your car keys.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1620" target="_blank">00:27:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And the extreme is death.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1623" target="_blank">00:27:03.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But in between, we know ADHD measurably derails education, disrupts social relationships, impacts your likelihood of your earning potential.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1634" target="_blank">00:27:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, ADHD isn't just an academic cognitive problem.</span></div><div

get through school.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1641" target="_blank">00:27:21.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It isn't just

target="_blank">00:27:27.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It's also having social implications.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1649" target="_blank">00:27:29.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And in all of those areas, it's having measurable, detrimental, significant impacts on people's lives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1657" target="_blank">00:27:37.800</a></span> | <span class="t">My understanding, and you'll see how this weaves into the previous question in a moment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1664" target="_blank">00:27:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">My understanding is that people with ADHD have the ability to focus quite intensely on things that really capture their interest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

educational system at a time when there were no smartphones.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1686" target="_blank">00:28:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm really grateful for that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1687" target="_blank">00:28:07.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I actually used to unplug the phone in the laboratory where I was a PhD student so that I could just do experiments from 5:00 PM on, because that was the only way people could reach me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1695" target="_blank">00:28:15.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And I certainly am familiar with the, it's almost a drug-like effect of dropping into an activity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1704" target="_blank">00:28:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes people call it flow, but for me, it just is dropping into an activity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1708" target="_blank">00:28:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Did some early morning writing this morning, and gosh, the feeling of pleasure just everywhere from head to toe after doing 20 minutes of focused work or 30 minutes of focused work is so striking to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1721" target="_blank">00:28:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And yet I like, I think most people find it difficult sometimes to just get rid of all the distractions unless there's a deadline, which is one of the reasons I love deadlines.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1730" target="_blank">00:28:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So the question is this, is it true that people with ADHD can in fact focus, but that somehow whatever neural or neurochemical thresholds are there to allow them to drop into focus, they're just much higher thresholds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1745" target="_blank">00:29:05.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It just takes more fear of a deadline or fear of a consequence or excitement about the activity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1751" target="_blank">00:29:11.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Is that true?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1753" target="_blank">00:29:13.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so I'll back up a little bit, and I maybe should have said this when we were talking about diagnosis and what is ADHD.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1759" target="_blank">00:29:19.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And many people think it's a horrible title because it focuses on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1766" target="_blank">00:29:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's very clear as you're enumerating here, it's not a deficit of attention.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1771" target="_blank">00:29:31.800</a></span> | <span class="t">If it's a deficit at all, it's a deficit of control over attention.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1775" target="_blank">00:29:35.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And with attention, there's at least three different realms where we're controlling it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1780" target="_blank">00:29:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, one is we direct attention.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1782" target="_blank">00:29:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So if something's important going on over there, there, so we have to be able to shift it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1786" target="_blank">00:29:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Two, you have to be able to sustain it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1789" target="_blank">00:29:49.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So if it's a situation that's appropriate to be sustaining it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1793" target="_blank">00:29:53.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And three is you need to shift out of it if it's inappropriate to stay in it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1799" target="_blank">00:29:59.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And in all three of those realms, people with ADHD have less volitional control over their attention.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1808" target="_blank">00:30:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So many people in the ADHD who experience it describe hyperfocus as one of their superpowers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1814" target="_blank">00:30:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And that is where they're getting so absorbed in their work that they are so busy coding that actually everyone else in the office has left.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1823" target="_blank">00:30:23.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's only when the janitor is coming and emptying the garbage cans at 11:00 p.m.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1827" target="_blank">00:30:27.800</a></span> | <span class="t">that they say, "Oh my God, where is everyone? I'm still here."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1831" target="_blank">00:30:31.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Because I was so intently working on the project.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1834" target="_blank">00:30:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Some people strongly resist the idea that flow, and I'm going to butcher the Csiksumaha.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1841" target="_blank">00:30:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Csiksumaha.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1842"

target="_blank">00:30:43.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, no one can pronounce his name.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1844" target="_blank">00:30:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Even fewer can spell it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1845" target="_blank">00:30:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1846" target="_blank">00:30:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1847" target="_blank">00:30:47.800</a></span> | <span class="t">My reading of when I sort of delved into this, I think hyperfocus is exactly a flow state.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1853" target="_blank">00:30:53.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Because people are describing the same lack of awareness of time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1858" target="_blank">00:30:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's always, I mean, it's a task that's somewhat challenging and engaging and interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1864" target="_blank">00:31:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not just that, you know, if it were just about enjoyment or bliss, you could hyperfocus looking at a beautiful flower.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1873" target="_blank">00:31:13.800</a></span> | <span class="t">People don't describe that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1875" target="_blank">00:31:15.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So it needs the right amount of challenge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1878" target="_blank">00:31:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It can't be too easy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1879" target="_blank">00:31:19.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It can't be too hard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1880" target="_blank">00:31:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It has to be something important and interesting to you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1884" target="_blank">00:31:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It involves, you know, oblivion, not just to time, but also to lots of space going around you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1892" target="_blank">00:31:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think they are pretty close, if not the same phenomena, flow and hyperfocus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1900" target="_blank">00:31:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And some people with ADHD, and I think some are ones who learn what situational factors or what internal factors can help get them into that state.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1911" target="_blank">00:31:51.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But many of them still struggle with showing up when they don't want to be hyperfocus on something or have trouble engaging it when it would be useful to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1922" target="_blank">00:32:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I sometimes use the absent-minded professor excuse, but only half jokingly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1928" target="_blank">00:32:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a photograph that I love of the great Oliver Sacks, the neurologist turned writer, man who mistook his wife for his hat, awakenings and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1938" target="_blank">00:32:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">People may be familiar with Oliver's work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1940" target="_blank">00:32:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's a photograph of Oliver at a train station, lots of bodies moving around him, some blurry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1948" target="_blank">00:32:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's motion there and he's standing there with, I think he's got his pipe in his mouth and he's writing outside the train station.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1958" target="_blank">00:32:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">His bag has fallen to the floor, some items are coming out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1961" target="_blank">00:32:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And he was a known and self-professed methamphetamine addict for a great portion of his medical and writing career.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1970" target="_blank">00:32:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, sort of alluded to the idea that he had these tendencies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1976" target="_blank">00:32:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And I raise this as an example because I see that photo and I see somebody who's in hyper focus in a very busy environment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1984" target="_blank">00:33:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But he wrote, I've spent a lot of time with his work and his autobiography, et cetera, and talked to people who knew him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=1991" target="_blank">00:33:11.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And it seemed that he was constantly seeking novel environments where there was a lot of stimulation and somehow that allowed him to drop into these tunnels of focus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2001" target="_blank">00:33:21.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Whereas when he spent a lot of time alone, there were bouts of focus, but the quiet actually became a distraction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2009" target="_blank">00:33:29.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It was as if somebody in here were speculating about diagnoses, but that there's something about external anchors and internal anchors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2017" target="_blank">00:33:37.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And that finding that sweet spot is really about knowing ourselves and where we work best at particular times.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2023" target="_blank">00:33:43.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is something I'd like to transition into here is talking about the fact that there isn't just one environment that works for somebody.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2032" target="_blank">00:33:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It seems like it's often the case that it's certain environments for morning, certain environments for afternoon, certain environments having returned from vacation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2040" target="_blank">00:34:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can probably see where I'm going with this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2043" target="_blank">00:34:03.800</a></span> | <span class="t">What are your thoughts on people trying to with ADHD or not trying to identify sort of best conditions for them?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2052" target="_blank">00:34:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And how important is circadian time here?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2055" target="_blank">00:34:15.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I know you have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2056" target="_blank">00:34:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And of course, I mentioned in the introduction that you have a lot of background in circadian biology, which I think brings in a really additional and unique dynamic to your understanding of ADHD.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2066" target="_blank">00:34:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So many people come to me as a psychiatrist for ADHD are primarily focused on medications.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2073" target="_blank">00:34:33.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And we still know that the stimulants are the single most powerful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2078" target="_blank">00:34:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, in terms of extent of symptom reduction overall, and in terms of the percentage of people they help, they're our most potent tool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2086" target="_blank">00:34:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, the medicine is not going to change everything and you need to be focusing on your life as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2091" target="_blank">00:34:51.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And I always start with scheduling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2093" target="_blank">00:34:53.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And many people with ADHD find scheduling anathema.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2098" target="_blank">00:34:58.800</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2106" target="_blank">00:35:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And what I tell them is that the part of you that's going to help make the schedule that works for you isn't some evil taskmaster trying to make you do what you don't want to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2118" target="_blank">00:35:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It's actually the wisest, smartest, nicest, kindest part of you that's identified.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2125" target="_blank">00:35:25.800</a></span> | <span class="t">What are your bigger goals?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2126" target="_blank">00:35:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">How are we going to match what you're doing in the minute to line up with those bigger goals?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2131" target="_blank">00:35:31.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So, and this analogy isn't perfect, but the best one I've come up with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2134" target="_blank">00:35:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So rather than the guy on the Viking ship, the person, you, the part of you that's making your schedule is a mother hen who's sort of counting all the chicks and making things aligned and nestling down and hunkering around you and taking care of you and nurturing you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2152" target="_blank">00:35:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And with scheduling, what I tell people is before you slide in your work or your homework or your school or externally derived tasks, I tell people you need to have the four basics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2167" target="_blank">00:36:07.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And sleep is far and away the biggest basic, particularly for it's essential for all of us, but it's particularly critical for ADHD and there's particular reasons why it's a particular challenge for people with ADHD.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2182" target="_blank">00:36:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But I'm trying to think if I can imagine a counter example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2186" target="_blank">00:36:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I would say all the successful people I know with ADHD have found some way to try to regularize their sleep compared to what it would be if they were just, so the four essentials I say are sleep, eating, exercise or some amount of movement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2200" target="_blank">00:36:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Because again, with the hyperactivity, there's, there's people who can sit at a desk for 12 hours, not even getting up to, for a bathroom break or to eat or anything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2209" target="_blank">00:36:49.800</a></span> | <span class="t">That's not just bad.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2212" target="_blank">00:36:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, that's bad for your brain, bad for your body.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2214" target="_blank">00:36:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the fourth thing I put in is a miscellaneous category of me time, relaxation, meditation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2222" target="_blank">00:37:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I put all those in the same slot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2224" target="_blank">00:37:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe they shouldn't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2225" target="_blank">00:37:05.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And all those need to be in place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2227" target="_blank">00:37:07.800</a></span> | <span class="t">We can talk more about sleep, but I'll just say a little bit more about the eating component.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2233" target="_blank">00:37:13.800</a></span> | <span class="t">One of my, so we have our diagnostic criteria for ADHD, but I had over the years, two different real life tests.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2242" target="_blank">00:37:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">The office I had was an old Victorian home.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2245" target="_blank">00:37:25.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So it was a home office.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2246" target="_blank">00:37:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">The office itself was at the entrance was at the end of a short, but very steep driveway.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2251" target="_blank">00:37:31.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So it was a separate door.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2254" target="_blank">00:37:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And I would always explain to every new patient the exact same thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2259" target="_blank">00:37:39.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, there's a house at 45 Hartford.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2262" target="_blank">00:37:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">The office is at 45A.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2264" target="_blank">00:37:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">The entrance is at the end of the driveway.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2266" target="_blank">00:37:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And I actually did the data on it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2272" target="_blank">00:37:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">The only people who ever showed up at the front door, the home door, were the people with ADHD.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2278" target="_blank">00:37:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Now everyone, it wasn't, it was specific for ADHD.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2282" target="_blank">00:38:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It wasn't completely sensitive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2283" target="_blank">00:38:03.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So some of the ADHD people got it right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2286" target="_blank">00:38:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But never did anyone who was coming in for OCD or depression or PTSD show up at the front door.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2292" target="_blank">00:38:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And I gave the instructions at the same time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2294" target="_blank">00:38:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And sometimes I didn't know beforehand that the person was coming in for ADHD because they didn't know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2300" target="_blank">00:38:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But if they showed up at the front door, that always made me, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2304" target="_blank">00:38:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">"Uh-oh, I better make sure I ask specific detailed questions about the ADHD possible component."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2311" target="_blank">00:38:31.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So the other sort of real life diagnostic test I had, if someone during the evaluation would say something like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2319" target="_blank">00:38:39.800</a></span> | <span class="t">"Oh, it was four o'clock yesterday and I just realized I hadn't eaten all day."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2325" target="_blank">00:38:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2327" target="_blank">00:38:47.800</a></span> | <span class="t">That's, I mean, I have people who diet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2329" target="_blank">00:38:49.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I have people who have, you know, fasting regimens or others, but they're not forgetting to eat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2335" target="_blank">00:38:55.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's not that everyone at the ADHD does that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2338" target="_blank">00:38:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But either either not getting the right inter-receptive cues from your body or not paying attention to them is something that's been measurable in people with ADHD.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2350" target="_blank">00:39:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So having a regular meal schedule.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2352" target="_blank">00:39:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So having a regular meal schedule.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2354" target="_blank">00:39:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, getting back to the COVID in workplace.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2356" target="_blank">00:39:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're, you know, I had lots of people in tech who really lamented, now I have to work for home.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2362" target="_blank">00:39:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">They were giving me lunch, a healthy, nice lunch each day at work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2366" target="_blank">00:39:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">They're scrambling to even use the home, you know, meal delivery systems because getting that organized and set up is just too overwhelming for them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2376" target="_blank">00:39:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, these are bright people who are succeeding in most parts of their life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2382" target="_blank">00:39:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Are these people with ADHD sometimes also starting a meal, taking a few bites and then going back to work?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2388" target="_blank">00:39:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And then like the meal never really ends?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2391" target="_blank">00:39:51.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It just sort of fragments into the rest of the day?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2394" target="_blank">00:39:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, that can be one variation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2396" target="_blank">00:39:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's often just completely forgetting or being oblivious to it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2401" target="_blank">00:40:01.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, the other ways ADHD can play a role is I was meaning to have breakfast before I left the house.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2408" target="_blank">00:40:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But always when it's time to leave the house, you forget that you hadn't done this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2414" target="_blank">00:40:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And the kids' shoes need to be tied.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2416" target="_blank">00:40:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And, oh, do I need a new toothbrush?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2419" target="_blank">00:40:19.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I better go check upstairs before I go out because I'm going to the CVS store.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2424" target="_blank">00:40:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, time management is a problem with ADHD, an executive function problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2430" target="_blank">00:40:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Interestingly, it's not one of the 18 symptoms in our official checklist.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2435" target="_blank">00:40:35.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So our official checklist is sort of a crude clinical attempt to map out a lot of the aspects of ADHD, but it misses a lot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2445" target="_blank">00:40:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's emotional regulation problems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2448" target="_blank">00:40:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">We know something like 60% of people with ADHD acknowledge that emotions explode or come up bigger or stronger and are harder to regulate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2459" target="_blank">00:40:59.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's nowhere acknowledged in our official diagnostic symptomatology.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2464" target="_blank">00:41:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I'd like to take a quick break and thank our sponsor, AG1.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2468" target="_blank">00:41:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">AG1 is an all-in-one vitamin mineral probiotic drink with adaptogens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2473" target="_blank">00:41:13.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I've been taking AG1 daily since 2012, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring this podcast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2478" target="_blank">00:41:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">The reason I started taking AG1 and the reason I still take AG1 is because it is the highest quality and most complete foundational nutritional supplement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2486" target="_blank">00:41:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">What that means is that AG1 ensures that you're getting all the necessary vitamins, minerals, and other micronutrients to form a strong foundation for your daily health.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2495" target="_blank">00:41:35.800</a></span> | <span class="t">AG1 also has probiotics and prebiotics that support a healthy gut microbiome.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2500" target="_blank">00:41:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Your gut microbiome consists of trillions of microorganisms that line your digestive tract and impact things such as your immune system status, your metabolic health, your hormone health, and much more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2510" target="_blank">00:41:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So I've consistently found that when I take AG1 daily, my digestion is improved, my immune system is more robust, and my mood and mental focus are at their best.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2519" target="_blank">00:41:59.800</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, if I could take just one supplement, that supplement would be AG1.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2523" target="_blank">00:42:03.800</a></span>

<span class="t">So, we've got sleep, eating, exercise, or movement, and relaxation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2546" target="_blank">00:42:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe before we start talking about some medications and some other factors that modulate ADHD, if we could maybe step through each of those and you could share with us some of your favorite tools that you give your patients and that you teach online.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2562" target="_blank">00:42:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Realizing, of course, that each one of those is a vast topic that we have done entire podcasts on, but I'm curious about your favorite go-to tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2574" target="_blank">00:42:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">We were talking about a few of these before we started.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2576" target="_blank">00:42:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So, sleep, regular to bed and wake-up times?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2580" target="_blank">00:43:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Matthew Walker, in his great book on sleep, one of my favorite things about it is he really emphasizes this point that quality sleep isn't just about eight hours.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2591" target="_blank">00:43:11.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It isn't just duration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2592" target="_blank">00:43:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It's getting quality sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2594" target="_blank">00:43:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And the timing of your sleep is every bit as important as the duration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2598" target="_blank">00:43:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So, if you're used to sleeping midnight to 8:00 a.m. and you're staying up dancing or partying until 4:00 a.m.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2605" target="_blank">00:43:25.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And you say, "Oh, it's a weekend. I can sleep until noon."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2608" target="_blank">00:43:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You may still get those eight hours, but they're not restorative to the same extent as if you had slept at your regular time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2615" target="_blank">00:43:35.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, my PhD research was on circadian rhythms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2620" target="_blank">00:43:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">We had realms of data back then.</span></div><div class="c"><span

night owls,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2646" target="_blank">00:44:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">to have a different

target="_blank">00:44:13.800</a></span> | <span class="t">For many years now, we've actually known that this is strongly genetically controlled.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2659" target="_blank">00:44:19.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we do have, you know, there are genetic markers affecting sleep timing that are overrepresented strongly in the ADHD community.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2667" target="_blank">00:44:27.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So, some of it is you are pushed that way, but some of it is the nature of ADHD.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2672" target="_blank">00:44:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">That if you, you know, procrastinating is part of ADHD.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2675" target="_blank">00:44:35.800</a></span> | <span class="t">If you procrastinate, you're going to push things off until the end of the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2679" target="_blank">00:44:39.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Some people, the end of the day is a better time to work because there's fewer distractions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2685" target="_blank">00:44:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, if everyone else is asleep finally, no one's going to come in and interrupt your work or ask what your thoughts on this project are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2692" target="_blank">00:44:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But again, getting regular sleep and regular and sufficient doesn't mean it has to be what I'd say normal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2701" target="_blank">00:45:01.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, if it works for you, if you can build your career and your social life around sleeping from 2 a.m. till 10 a.m. every day,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2709" target="_blank">00:45:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I'd say go for it if you can be

things that help with getting regular sleep?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2717" target="_blank">00:45:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">One thing paradoxically for many people is actually being on stimulant medications.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2722" target="_blank">00:45:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So stimulants do have, as a side effect, some people have insomnia, some people stay up later.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2729" target="_blank">00:45:29.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But more people with ADHD tend to, either because the drug is wearing off at the end of the day and there's some crash in alertness or energy,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2739" target="_blank">00:45:39.800</a></span> | <span class="t">or because they're being more productively expending energy and are more tired at the end of the day,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2744" target="_blank">00:45:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">or it's just helping synchronize circadian clocks by getting a consistent start early in the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2749" target="_blank">00:45:49.800</a></span> | <span class="t">We don't know the mechanism by which it works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2753" target="_blank">00:45:53.800</a></span> | <span class="t">There's lots of plausible and overlapping ones.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2755" target="_blank">00:45:55.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But again, daytime alertness medications can help.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2759" target="_blank">00:45:59.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Can I run something by you in that context before we jump back?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2764" target="_blank">00:46:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't consistently take stimulants except caffeine, and I limit my caffeine intake to prior to 2 p.m.,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2770" target="_blank">00:46:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and I stack it pretty heavy in the early part of the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2774" target="_blank">00:46:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But on occasion, I'll take 25 to 50 milligrams of Welbutrin,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2781" target="_blank">00:46:21.800</a></span> | <span class="t">which, as you know better than I, is slightly dopaminergic but certainly triggers noradrenergic release.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2789" target="_blank">00:46:29.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So epinephrine, norepinephrine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2791" target="_blank">00:46:31.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a stimulant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2793" target="_blank">00:46:33.800</a></span> | <span class="t">On the days when I take that, which again is very rare, and I track my sleep every night,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2800" target="_blank">00:46:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I notice a significant improvement in my sleep and significant increase in my rapid eye movement sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2807" target="_blank">00:46:47.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It's extremely consistent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2809" target="_blank">00:46:49.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So from that, I sort of reverse engineered the major effect being norepinephrine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2815" target="_blank">00:46:55.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Epinephrine, I decided, well, I would do something else that I know raises epinephrine,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2820" target="_blank">00:47:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">which is I'll do a cold plunge first thing in the morning of one to three minutes long.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2825" target="_blank">00:47:05.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And the effect isn't quite as strong, but on those same days when I do that clearly adrenaline-raising activity,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2832" target="_blank">00:47:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I also see a, for me, a significant increase in my rapid eye movement sleep and the quality of sleep later that night.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2840" target="_blank">00:47:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think there really is something to this epinephrine, obviously going, you know, hand in hand with stimulants,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2847" target="_blank">00:47:27.800</a></span> | <span class="t">epinephrine spike early and throughout the day with better rapid eye movement sleep at night.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2854" target="_blank">00:47:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Does that logically hold for you?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2856" target="_blank">00:47:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just a story.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2857" target="_blank">00:47:37.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I was going to say, but those have some science background.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2861" target="_blank">00:47:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'd say, I'm glad it works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2864" target="_blank">00:47:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And what's hard to sorting out is why it's working is one is, you know, potential placebo effect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2870" target="_blank">00:47:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You're doing it because you're thinking or hoping it works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2873" target="_blank">00:47:53.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2874" target="_blank">00:47:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And two, I'd say maybe even more importantly than the placebo effect is the days that you're deciding to do this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2880" target="_blank">00:48:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">there's something different about those days to begin with because you're not doing it every day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2884" target="_blank">00:48:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So those potential issues aside, I'll jump into insomnia and Matthew Walker talks about some of this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2897" target="_blank">00:48:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">To me, maybe the biggest finding in insomnia sleep medicine of the last 20 years</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2902" target="_blank">00:48:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">is that almost everyone who has a problem with insomnia doesn't have a problem with sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2908"

target="_blank">00:48:29.800</a></span> | <span class="t">What?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2910" target="_blank">00:48:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Do I sound like I'm contradicting myself?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2912" target="_blank">00:48:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">What I mean is the sleep system's intact.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2915" target="_blank">00:48:35.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It's there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2916" target="_blank">00:48:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It's waiting to arrive and put you to sleep each night.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2919" target="_blank">00:48:39.800</a></span> | <span class="t">What the problem, and this is from the sleep researchers, with at least 90% or probably more of people who have insomnia problems,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2927" target="_blank">00:48:47.800</a></span> | <span class="t">is the failure of the daytime arousal system to shut off properly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2931" target="_blank">00:48:51.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So normally we have these two mutually inhibitory systems, a wakefulness arousal system and a sleep sedation system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2941" target="_blank">00:49:01.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And usually when one turns on, the other turns off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2944" target="_blank">00:49:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And with most people's problem with insomnia, it isn't that sleep is weak or insufficient or not there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2950" target="_blank">00:49:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It's sitting, it's waiting there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2952" target="_blank">00:49:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It just can't land on the landing pad because you're too aroused or too awake.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2956" target="_blank">00:49:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, maybe that helps the arousal system to turn off better at the end of the day if it's gotten more fully engaged during the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2965" target="_blank">00:49:25.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2966" target="_blank">00:49:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But it feeds back more into some of the non-medication approaches to helping with sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2971" target="_blank">00:49:31.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And that is doing everything you can.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2974" target="_blank">00:49:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, not just to force sleep or push it because that doesn't work very well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2978" target="_blank">00:49:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It's getting rid of arousal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2980" target="_blank">00:49:40.800</a></span> | <span

for people with ADHD, one is, you know, deciding on what's a reasonable bedtime.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=2987"

exert their power over you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3065" target="_blank">00:51:05.800</a></span> | <span class="t">rather

now?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3082" target="_blank">00:51:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">That can be

a little bit before, one of my favorite tools for falling asleep is actually cyclic sighing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3107"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3111" target="_blank">00:51:51.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So we know cyclic sighing engages the parasympathetic nervous system, our rest and digest system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3118" target="_blank">00:51:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, one of the things that happens normally in the transition every night when you fall asleep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3123"

that our bladders get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3193" target="_blank">00:53:13.800</a></span> | <span class="t">smaller as we

a day of cyclic sighing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3264" target="_blank">00:54:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And I

getting it in until bedtime, which is that I slept really well until I was around 40</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3277" target="_blank">00:54:37.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and not so well the next 20 years, mostly with the trouble of falling asleep,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3282" target="_blank">00:54:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">even though I knew of relaxation techniques and others.</span></div><div

for the general health.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3290" target="_blank">00:54:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And I do have slightly elevated blood pressure and relaxation and to see what effect it would have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3296" target="_blank">00:54:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was clear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3297" target="_blank">00:54:57.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So I do about five minutes and much more than five minutes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3302" target="_blank">00:55:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I tell people, and I might be doing it a little slower than most, count out about 20 or 25 reps of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3309" target="_blank">00:55:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you lose

to the lowest number.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3315" target="_blank">00:55:15.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Because, again, everything we're trying to do is decrease arousal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3318" target="_blank">00:55:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">If you have a timer on it and you do it for five minutes and then you're woken up, you're reversing or mitigating some of the benefit of doing it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3326" target="_blank">00:55:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So my recommendation is do it for five minutes, about, but do it by counting reps and don't focus or, you know, if it's six minutes, if it's four.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3338" target="_blank">00:55:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, there's so many aspects of this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3341" target="_blank">00:55:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And we know the exhalation has to be longer.</span></div><div class="c"><span

a four-second exhalation better than 10 versus six?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3351" target="_blank">00:55:51.800</a></span> |

target="_blank">00:55:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, there's lots of variables that we can play with to see what's optimal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3358" target="_blank">00:55:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think we know at all what's optimal, but we know what's good enough to work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3363" target="_blank">00:56:03.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm delighted to hear that it's

looking at acute aerobic exercise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3448" target="_blank">00:57:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Part of it is that it's hard to study people when they're exercising during many exercises.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3453" target="_blank">00:57:33.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, you're not going to wire someone up when they're swimming, for example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3458" target="_blank">00:57:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's not a lot of studies in any one approach and there's so much diversity that often it just gets lumped together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3465" target="_blank">00:57:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So there do seem to be some acute effects of measurably improving some of the executive functions associated with better attention from acute exercise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3474" target="_blank">00:57:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And there seem to be some more general or longer term benefits from people who are consistently actively exercising, having, you know, being able to concentrate longer, being able to switch attention more appropriately or effectively.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3491" target="_blank">00:58:11.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's a huge body of sort of clinical literature of patients reporting, you know, I know I feel much more alert the day I get my workout in the gym or I feel better or the week I took off from that was a big mistake.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3506" target="_blank">00:58:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I would say identifying at what's the most valuable or what's the best duration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3512" target="_blank">00:58:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I ran through the data about a year or two ago and it's I could say that we can't make any conclusions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3518" target="_blank">00:58:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And I would say at some level, try it and see what works for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3522" target="_blank">00:58:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's what's important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3525" target="_blank">00:58:45.800</a></span> | <span

class="t">Is there a relationship between ADHD and addiction because of the impulsivity component?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3534" target="_blank">00:58:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, and so the answer is, and these are really rough statistics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3539" target="_blank">00:58:59.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I actually, one of my pet peeves is people who quote, oh, the rate of this is 27.43%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3545" target="_blank">00:59:05.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, it might have been in that study, but that's looking at one population at one set.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3551" target="_blank">00:59:11.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So I use ballpark figures.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3553" target="_blank">00:59:13.800</a></span> | <span class="t">The ballpark figure is Americans in the last 20 years, more than that, about 20% of Americans run into some addiction, substance addiction problems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3563" target="_blank">00:59:23.800</a></span> | <span class="t">They're not either alcohol or drugs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3566" target="_blank">00:59:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">People with ADHD have a rate that's almost double that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3569" target="_blank">00:59:29.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's higher in men than in women.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3572" target="_blank">00:59:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Double?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3573" target="_blank">00:59:33.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Almost double.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3574" target="_blank">00:59:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Almost 40% risk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3575" target="_blank">00:59:35.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's for substance abuse and not behavioral addictions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3579" target="_blank">00:59:39.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, that's substance abuse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3580" target="_blank">00:59:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's looking at abuse and we can get into the related topic of what's misuse and versus abuse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3586" target="_blank">00:59:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And I have pet peeves there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3588" target="_blank">00:59:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">However, kids who are put on stimulant medications when they're young, and I should say the stimulants themselves do have a small potential for addiction, but putting kids on stimulants pretty much normalizes the rate of addiction problems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3606" target="_blank">01:00:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So it protects them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3607" target="_blank">01:00:07.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It protects them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3608" target="_blank">01:00:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It protects them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3609" target="_blank">01:00:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a really important point that I think maybe we just hover on for a second because I think many people, including myself, assume that, well, if you were putting these kids on amphetamines, of which many of the medications for ADHD are, that we're creating kids that are addicted to amphetamines or to a hyperstimulation period.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3631" target="_blank">01:00:31.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But you're telling me it's actually protective to put kids with real ADHD on medication for ADHD.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3638" target="_blank">01:00:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3639" target="_blank">01:00:39.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I can say not absolutely every study has found this, but several large meta-analyses have gone back and most of them have found this fairly dramatic benefit to being on stimulants as a kid in terms of specifically reducing substance abuse risk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3656" target="_blank">01:00:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And some of them that have looked at this, when I said it was a yes and, it seems to be that it's not just the impulsivity traits, but some of the inattentive ones too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3666" target="_blank">01:01:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">If your teacher's lecturing about the risks of alcohol or this and this, and you're zoning out the window and looking at the plane flying by, you have less pertinent information on the topics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3677" target="_blank">01:01:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You may be less attentive to the negative effects that other kids are seeing among the classmates who are stoners at this age or X, Y, or Z.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3686" target="_blank">01:01:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So it seems that both inattentive sets of ADHD symptoms and the impulsive, you know, thrill-seeking, not weighing the consequences as heavily are all contributing to this heightened risk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3701" target="_blank">01:01:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I have this model in my head that is perhaps completely wrong, maybe partially wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3708" target="_blank">01:01:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And it goes something like this, that we know that the neural circuits involved in executive control and directing attention and maintaining attention and avoiding distraction, this kind of thing, use dopamine and epinephrine and norepinephrine, at least to some extent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3728" target="_blank">01:02:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And we know that people with ADHD are capable of focus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3733" target="_blank">01:02:13.800</a></span> | <span class="t">As you said, it's a failure to direct that focus, maintain, et cetera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3737" target="_blank">01:02:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So I've heard from you before this discussion that, you know, people that, you know, tend to drink lots and lots of caffeine or who can drop into an activity but have a lot of distractibility that, you know, they might have ADHD.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3751" target="_blank">01:02:31.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So what I'm imagining here is that the threshold to get dopamine, epinephrine and norepinephrine released is either much higher or more complicated for people with ADHD.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3762" target="_blank">01:02:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what they're seeking is these catecholamines, these three chemicals, dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3769" target="_blank">01:02:49.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And that if they're given a medication that puts them in that range where they're getting it, then they're good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3775" target="_blank">01:02:55.800</a></span> | <span class="t">They can stop seeking it, so to speak.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3778" target="_blank">01:02:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm raising this now because we're talking about addiction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3781" target="_blank">01:03:01.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Addiction is a, you know, a pursuit of things essentially.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3785" target="_blank">01:03:05.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And I guess what I'm saying is it seems to me that the model of ADHD that we hear about is that, you know, people can't focus, you know, their dopamine circuits are all out of whack.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3798" target="_blank">01:03:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you put them on this dopaminergic drug and, you know, basically you get them addicted to that tunnel vision or something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3804" target="_blank">01:03:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But I have this model in mind now that what we are all seeking is to have portions of our day where we are directing our focus towards meaningful build, the things that are, you know, generative in our life, work, school, relationships, etc.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3818" target="_blank">01:03:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And that whether or not it's pharmacology or exercise or what have you, that it's just about getting into this plane of consciousness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3827" target="_blank">01:03:47.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And I say that in no woo or abstract terms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3830" target="_blank">01:03:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Is that right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3831" target="_blank">01:03:51.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, are we really talking about here is a failure to access enough of these neuromodulators and these medications, which we're about to talk about, are really about putting us in the realm where those neuromodulators are just more accessible?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3843" target="_blank">01:04:03.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll just say I can go with that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3845" target="_blank">01:04:05.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3846" target="_blank">01:04:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, you're the expert.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3847" target="_blank">01:04:07.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, I'm putting this together based on kind of what we're talking about, like getting enough sleep to me is a way of being able to have enough arousal during the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3855" target="_blank">01:04:15.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, exercise or these medications, just different ways of being able to access arousal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3862" target="_blank">01:04:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Like if you don't sleep, you can't access arousal during the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3864" target="_blank">01:04:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So, okay, well, I'm going to hold that model in mind and I'm going to keep testing it to try and destroy it as we go forward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3870" target="_blank">01:04:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's talk about the medications since you raised those.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3876" target="_blank">01:04:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, the first one I ever heard about was Ritalin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3881" target="_blank">01:04:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's start with Ritalin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3883" target="_blank">01:04:43.800</a></span> | <span class="t">How often is Ritalin used nowadays and what is Ritalin doing neurochemically?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3890" target="_blank">01:04:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And what are your thoughts on Ritalin as a useful drug for childhood and adult ADHD?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3895" target="_blank">01:04:55.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm happy to repeat those questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3897" target="_blank">01:04:57.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So Ritalin is, or generic methylphenidate, and there's dozens now of slow-release versions and there's even a patch, a skin patch instead of an oral version.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3910" target="_blank">01:05:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Our definition of what a stimulant is, is really squishy and vague.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3915" target="_blank">01:05:15.800</a></span> | <span class="t">In its broadest sense, it's any drug that has an effect in the body, like the sympathetic nervous system, which is a norepinephrine-driven fight-or-flight arousal system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3926" target="_blank">01:05:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So by the loosest criteria, caffeine's a stimulant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3931" target="_blank">01:05:31.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Wellbutrin's a stimulant, even though we classify it as an antidepressant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3935" target="_blank">01:05:35.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Some of the decongestants are stimulants.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3940" target="_blank">01:05:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But more often when we're talking ADHD medicines, we're using stimulant more specifically for amphetamine-based products like Adderall and Vyvanse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3948" target="_blank">01:05:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, there's a host now of newer branded extended-release forms and methylphenidate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3953" target="_blank">01:05:53.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And we lump the two together, probably most ADHD experts agree with, and this is where I'm going to be disagreeing with most of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3962" target="_blank">01:06:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't consider Ritalin a full stimulant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3965" target="_blank">01:06:05.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So the neuropharmacologists differ a little bit, but amphetamine is a strong dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake blocker.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3974" target="_blank">01:06:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So it prevents what's already been released from being taken back up, so more is available longer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3980" target="_blank">01:06:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But in addition to that, amphetamine is a pretty potent, let's just say, vesicle manipulator.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3986" target="_blank">01:06:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's actually forcing a bigger release from the vesicles when they're synaptically released.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3992" target="_blank">01:06:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's not just that the signal lasts longer and is stronger because of that, it's a bigger signal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=3998" target="_blank">01:06:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Depending on what study you look at, most of the studies suggest that methylphenidate is actually a pretty weak vesicular manipulator.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4007" target="_blank">01:06:47.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And some studies don't find any impact there at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4010" target="_blank">01:06:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Which means if methylphenidate is basically a norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor, that's what Welbutrin is, that's one of the components.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4022" target="_blank">01:07:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And so why I would further say, if you look at the efficacy data, how well do these work in resolving ADHD symptoms?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4034" target="_blank">01:07:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">All the meta-analyses lump Adderall products, amphetamine, and methylphenidate products here and say, you know, they're here because they work better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4045" target="_blank">01:07:25.800</a></span> | <span class="t">This is, you know, success in reducing ADHD symptoms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4048" target="_blank">01:07:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And all of our stratera, adalmoxetine, Welbutrin, I use Cymbalta a lot, modafinil, guanfacine, all these other things are down here as less effective.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4059" target="_blank">01:07:39.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you actually look at any of the plots that I've looked at and separate out, methylphenidate is actually closer to the pack below.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4068" target="_blank">01:07:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It's the amphetamine products are head and shoulders above everything else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4072" target="_blank">01:07:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Methylphenidate is usually at the top of the rest of the crowd.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4075" target="_blank">01:07:55.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you're just looking at the data objectively, there's a clear decision point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4081" target="_blank">01:08:01.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So in terms of efficacy, amphetamine products are stronger.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4086" target="_blank">01:08:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But in terms of some of the side, you know, the side effect that I worry most about, it's not at all common, but it's one of the horrible ones, is amphetamine-induced psychosis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4098" target="_blank">01:08:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Now that we're finally looking at that a little more closely, because for years, ADHD experts have said, yeah, it's really rare, let's not look at it at all, let's not pay attention, move along, you know, don't look.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4110" target="_blank">01:08:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">With amphetamine adderall products, and that's probably dose-dependent, but it's close to one out of 500 people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4123" target="_blank">01:08:43.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And what's, I mean, I'm going off on a tangent here, but I'll keep following it because it's an important tangent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4125" target="_blank">01:08:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It's only one out of 500 people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4127" target="_blank">01:08:47.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It's uncommon, but this is a really bad condition, because amphetamine-induced psychosis is a schizophrenic-like picture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4135" target="_blank">01:08:55.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Usually someone is really paranoid, really worried that their friends are manipulating them or the police are spying on them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4142" target="_blank">01:09:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, if you drink too much alcohol, you can be batshit crazy, that's a highly technical term there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4148" target="_blank">01:09:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You can be out of touch with reality, you can be hallucinating, you can be saying all sorts of nasty things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4155" target="_blank">01:09:15.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But if it's alcohol-induced, you fall asleep at the end of that night, you wake up the next morning, you may feel horrible at the hangover, you're not hallucinating, you're not psychotic anymore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4165" target="_blank">01:09:25.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Hopefully you're regretting what you did, probably not remembering much of what you did.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4169" target="_blank">01:09:29.800</a></span> | <span class="t">People will let you know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4171" target="_blank">01:09:31.800</a></span> | <span class="t">With amphetamine-induced psychosis, on the other hand, classically and characteristically and what I've seen clinically,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4180" target="_blank">01:09:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">it continues for days, weeks, or months after stopping the medication, which means we've changed someone's brain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4190" target="_blank">01:09:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And we don't have lots and lots of data and it's actually only come to us because people are concerned about marijuana causing a similar picture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4198" target="_blank">01:09:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So now we're studying this a little more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4200" target="_blank">01:10:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But with amphetamine-induced psychosis, about, and these are again rounding from different studies, about 20%, if you look 20 years out,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4209" target="_blank">01:10:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">about 20% of those people are in a permanent psychotic state still.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4213" target="_blank">01:10:13.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, it's uncommon, but it's such a bad outcome that we really should be alerting people to it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4222" target="_blank">01:10:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And I've been, I saw a much higher risk of this for, I can get into it if we need a reasons in my population in San Francisco.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4231" target="_blank">01:10:31.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But I've had people coming from all the most prominent ADHD clinics over the years who just moved to the area.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4237" target="_blank">01:10:37.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And when I'd say this, give this as my introduction to, you know, I'm happy to continue on this, but are you aware?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4243" target="_blank">01:10:43.800</a></span> | <span class="t">To a person they said, no one ever told me that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4246" target="_blank">01:10:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Now maybe they have ADHD and weren't listening, but it's so uniformly consistent that they didn't hear or know that that was a side effect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4254" target="_blank">01:10:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And one in 500 isn't a trivially small number?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4257" target="_blank">01:10:57.800</a></span> | <span class="t">No, it's not trivial.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4258" target="_blank">01:10:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And I mean, why I got alerted to it is my rate in San Francisco is actually higher than one out of a hundred.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4265" target="_blank">01:11:05.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I'll go into, I think, a couple of different reasons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4270" target="_blank">01:11:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">One is I worked with a lot of HIV positive men and we know HIV, particularly in the days before we had effective antivirals, is a virus that goes to the brain and affect, you know, there's a HIV induced dementia.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4287" target="_blank">01:11:27.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So probably some of these people had brains that were compromised because of that, more vulnerable to a high incidence of methamphetamine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4297" target="_blank">01:11:37.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So methamphetamine street speed is a chemically different molecule than amphetamine as an extra methyl group.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4304" target="_blank">01:11:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And an extra methyl group can mean a lot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4306" target="_blank">01:11:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's a cousin, but methamphetamine we know has higher rates of psychosis, higher rates of addiction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4312" target="_blank">01:11:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">This tends to be more rewarding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4315" target="_blank">01:11:55.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But again, in that population, and many of them would hide that history from me, but I think that the very first person I had with amphetamine induced psychosis,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4324" target="_blank">01:12:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">a guy in his 40s, HIV positive for years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4328" target="_blank">01:12:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">This was back in early, mid-90s.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4331" target="_blank">01:12:11.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Was able to finish school in his mid-40s, get a good paying job in two years on stimulants,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4339" target="_blank">01:12:19.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and then had a full-blown psychotic episode where his dad had died of a heart attack 10 years earlier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4346" target="_blank">01:12:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">He was threatening his mom because he believed his mom had poisoned her.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4350" target="_blank">01:12:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">He flew over to Rhode Island where she was living.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4353" target="_blank">01:12:33.800</a></span> | <span class="t">He was making threats from a pay phone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4355" target="_blank">01:12:35.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And because Rhode Island is so small, he was actually calling from out of state.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4358" target="_blank">01:12:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So it was a federal crime.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4360" target="_blank">01:12:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">He got thrown in federal prison for this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4362" target="_blank">01:12:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And he stayed psychotic for months after he wasn't using anything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4367" target="_blank">01:12:47.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But it later turned out he had had a psychotic episode 10 years earlier on street meth,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4374" target="_blank">01:12:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">which he lied about when I did the evaluation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4377" target="_blank">01:12:57.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So the other high-risk group I had was I was known in San Francisco as someone who worked with adults with ADHD at the early stages of recognizing ADHD.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4386" target="_blank">01:13:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So, and I was comfortable with the broader range of stimulant dosages than many providers are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4395" target="_blank">01:13:15.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So I had people who had, and they were all young white males, straight males, who had history,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4402" target="_blank">01:13:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and I don't know how many of those demographics are relevant, but who had histories of taking stimulants, having a psychotic episode,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4411" target="_blank">01:13:31.800</a></span> | <span class="t">again, being really paranoid all, and again, the numbers aren't huge, but at least five people with this general profile.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4419" target="_blank">01:13:39.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But even though they were paranoid, even though they were severely impaired enough that each of them wound up in a psychiatric inpatient hospital,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4428" target="_blank">01:13:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">which is pretty hard to get into in this day and age, or even 20 years ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4433" target="_blank">01:13:53.800</a></span> | <span class="t">They all liked something about the experience enough that they all wanted to get back on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4438" target="_blank">01:13:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And all of them knew enough to lie about this past.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4441" target="_blank">01:14:01.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So they didn't tell me about, you know, they presented, all of them also had ADHD.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4447" target="_blank">01:14:07.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, they presented with ADHD, they'd say, "I'd been on stimulants before, and, you know, I'm not working with that doctor</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4453" target="_blank">01:14:13.800</a></span> | <span class="t">because my insurance changed or they had moved to the area."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4457" target="_blank">01:14:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">They gave plausible histories, and most of those within a month or two of restarting it wound up back in the psychiatric hospital.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4466" target="_blank">01:14:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I had one guy, bright computer programmer, late 20s, calling me from inside the psychiatric hospital to try to get me to prescribe more Adderall to him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4480" target="_blank">01:14:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And not only that, he had convinced his inpatient psychiatrist that this was a good idea, that this was important to treating his ADHD and helping him retain his job.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4491" target="_blank">01:14:51.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Wow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4492" target="_blank">01:14:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So these are, as you said, straight white males who have psychotic episodes on their ADHD meds and continue to seek those meds because they, quote unquote, like the experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=4508" target="_blank">01:15:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It feels like a manic high, the high dopaminergic state.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

more severely afflicted population, which, again, you would think would be a better match for the more powerful drugs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5063" target="_blank">01:24:23.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But even the cardiology associations have said, that seems to be a waste of resources.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5069" target="_blank">01:24:29.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Absolutely do a thorough history.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5071" target="_blank">01:24:31.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Absolutely do a thorough family history.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5074" target="_blank">01:24:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">If there's anything of concern, or if the patient's anxious about it, get an EKG.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5079" target="_blank">01:24:39.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But other than that, these should be generally safe for most people's hearts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5084" target="_blank">01:24:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So there was a meta-analysis that came out earlier this year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5089" target="_blank">01:24:49.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So most of the studies looking at more serious, other than just mild hypertension or mild elevation of heart rate, haven't found much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5098" target="_blank">01:24:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But most of them only look, you know, a year out or a year of treatment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5102" target="_blank">01:25:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Do we see rates of heart attacks?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5104" target="_blank">01:25:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Do we see rates of strokes?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5105" target="_blank">01:25:05.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Do we see rates of dangerous arrhythmias?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5108" target="_blank">01:25:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And in general, they're looking at a young population where these events are really uncommon anyway.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5115" target="_blank">01:25:15.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And most of them didn't find any evidence of problems in a year or two out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5120" target="_blank">01:25:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">The more recent study looked as long as 14 years out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5124" target="_blank">01:25:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And from there, they found measurable, statistically significant increase in risk that increased during the first three years of being on a stimulant and increased at a much lower rate for the next 10 years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5137" target="_blank">01:25:37.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Sort of plateaued out, but still measurably higher than people with ADHD who weren't on a stimulant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5144" target="_blank">01:25:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But the absolute rate is still really, really low.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5149" target="_blank">01:25:49.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So for most people, it's not a risk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5151" target="_blank">01:25:51.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, on the other hand, if you start these medicines when you're 10 or 20 and maybe on them for 60 years, we don't know whether potentially more people are getting into more trouble.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5163" target="_blank">01:26:03.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So if somebody presents as having ADHD as an adult and they've never touched stimulants, would you start them on Ritalin, Wellbutrin, or something in the Adderall Vyvanse cloud?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5178" target="_blank">01:26:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So thanks for bringing me back to your question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5181" target="_blank">01:26:21.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Sure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5182" target="_blank">01:26:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm going to jump through in the sort of qualifying phrase, never been on any stimulant in their life or tried it or something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5190" target="_blank">01:26:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">At least not consistently.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5191" target="_blank">01:26:31.800</a></span> | <span class="t">What I would say is these drugs are fairly common in our society, both illicitly and licitly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5200" target="_blank">01:26:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, we know lots of kids, lots of adults with ADHD share their medication.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5205" target="_blank">01:26:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Lots of people have tried these things, even if it's just once or twice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5210" target="_blank">01:26:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And that itself is valuable clinical data, you know, if they felt too revved up from it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5215" target="_blank">01:26:55.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, so if they have, I try to find out what dose was it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5218" target="_blank">01:26:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">What did it do for you?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5219" target="_blank">01:26:59.800</a></span> | <span class="t">What good things did it do for you?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5221" target="_blank">01:27:01.800</a></span> | <span class="t">What bad things did it do for you?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5223" target="_blank">01:27:03.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So my presentation is usually, you know, Adderall is likely to be the most strongly effective, or I more often are using Vyvanse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5234" target="_blank">01:27:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">These are the other options.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5236" target="_blank">01:27:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But Adderall also has, again, greater risk, rare, but risk for these bad problems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5241" target="_blank">01:27:21.800</a></span> | <span class="t">What, you know, does that scare you?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5245" target="_blank">01:27:25.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Some people are petrified.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5246" target="_blank">01:27:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">They're not going to go anywhere near that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5248" target="_blank">01:27:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Some people say, yeah, I'm not that concerned about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5252" target="_blank">01:27:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And most people do come in with some friends at work, family members, X, Y, or Z.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5259" target="_blank">01:27:39.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, they think they know what the drug is likely to have as an effect on them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5264" target="_blank">01:27:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And I tend to, at least as a starting point, listen to that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5268" target="_blank">01:27:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And now, I mean, there are certain reasons I absolutely would not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5274" target="_blank">01:27:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, my worry, again, I saw more of it than I think most people in a higher rate with amphetamine and psychosis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5281" target="_blank">01:28:01.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But a friend from college was just trying to refer a friend's son who's 27 and had a psychotic episode on marijuana and does have ADHD and is in bed depressed and not going to work and is being evaluated by two New York City doctors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5301" target="_blank">01:28:21.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But the psychiatrist kept him on Adderall.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5305" target="_blank">01:28:25.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I absolutely, again, the likelihood of recurrence seems so high that if you have a family history of schizophrenia or psychosis or you've had any experience of it, I would not prescribe a stimulant, an amphetamine-based stimulant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5323" target="_blank">01:28:43.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Could we go so far as to say, and I suspect the answer is no, but because nowadays we're hearing more about the possibility, I want to highlight possibility of high THC cannabis causing psychotic episodes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5336" target="_blank">01:28:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">This is something I've stressed on this podcast on social media.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5339" target="_blank">01:28:59.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I took a lot of heat for this from the traditional press.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5342" target="_blank">01:29:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, ironically, they're now putting out information that essentially speaks to the same.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5348" target="_blank">01:29:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not saying this happens in everybody, but there's certainly a possibility there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5352" target="_blank">01:29:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Would you say that if somebody is a regular high THC cannabis user that they are at greater risk to developing psychosis if they're taking these stimulant form ADHD meds?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5367" target="_blank">01:29:27.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5368" target="_blank">01:29:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, you could actually play that both ways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5370" target="_blank">01:29:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, you could claim that if they've already been on an agent without developing psychosis, then maybe they're more impervious to that as a potential side effect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5381" target="_blank">01:29:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Or where you were coming more from is if we're already on one agent that's pushing them that direction, why the heck would you ever add another that could also?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5389" target="_blank">01:29:49.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, my approach clinically would be more, what do you think the marijuana is doing for you?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5395" target="_blank">01:29:55.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And might it be more helpful to just clear that out of the picture before we add anything new onto it, but depending on what they say or don't say?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5404" target="_blank">01:30:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So, my reading of the data is very clear that there is some, I mean, there's even at low THC, there's some risk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5412" target="_blank">01:30:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Is it, you know, reefer madness that everyone who puffs a joint is freaking out?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5417" target="_blank">01:30:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Clearly not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5418" target="_blank">01:30:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But again, it's much more potent than it was 10 years or that was 70 years ago, I guess.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5424" target="_blank">01:30:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5425" target="_blank">01:30:25.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Especially as I understand, we had an expert from the cannabis research community on in edible form in particular, it's harder for people to control the dosage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5432" target="_blank">01:30:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Whereas when people use inhalation as a means to deliver, it seems like they kind of find the right plane without going overboard more often than with edibles in any case.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5443" target="_blank">01:30:43.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, another big factor is that CBD actually seems in some studies to have an antipsychotic effect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5450" target="_blank">01:30:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, maybe strains of marijuana 50 years ago that had a, whatever nature thought was a more balanced view, had less of a risk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5458" target="_blank">01:30:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But now that you can get pure THC products, and I'm sure you've highlighted that a big problem with this whole industry is, even in Colorado, which three years ago was a state with the most close regulation and inspection, and almost a majority of what the labels say don't correlate with what you're really getting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5477" target="_blank">01:31:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So, this is not a well-regulated industry, even though states are trying to regulate their industries, so you may not know what you're getting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5488" target="_blank">01:31:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">CBD, again, may have some protective effects, so getting pure and higher potency THC may be particularly undesirable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5499" target="_blank">01:31:39.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So, in my own YouTube podcast series, I've researched lots of subjects, and most of them I wind up saying, we don't have a lot of data on it, and there's not a lot of data on marijuana.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5511" target="_blank">01:31:51.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It's the one subject I've actually changed my mind from reading what was out there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5516" target="_blank">01:31:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And for years, I would tell people, because being in San Francisco, even before the wave of legalization, lots of people were using it, lots of people felt it helped them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5527" target="_blank">01:32:07.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And what I would tell them is, the data we have, and these are from everyday users, is that there are measurable, you know, that the characteristic of the classic stoner has a grain of truth to it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5540" target="_blank">01:32:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So, measurably, lower motivation, or organization of thought, lower energy are strongly correlated with daily marijuana use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5549" target="_blank">01:32:29.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Why would anyone with ADHD want any of that going on?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5553" target="_blank">01:32:33.800</a></span> | <span class="t">That seems like a perfect misfit, or accentuating what's not working right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5558" target="_blank">01:32:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Over the years, though, I had a handful of people who would swear, it worked better for them than stimulants, it worked better for them than the non-stimulant alternatives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5568" target="_blank">01:32:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Clearly not everybody.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5570" target="_blank">01:32:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And when I looked at the data, there is actually some tiny studies, you know, there are some that are funded by marijuana organizations, so that doesn't mean they're wrong, but it's harder to evaluate how objective they were.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5586" target="_blank">01:33:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's some research that suggests there is some sub-segment, and I don't think it's people with ADHD in general, but some subset of that population who may actually do better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5596" target="_blank">01:33:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And most of the time, they are looking at marijuana rather than pure THC.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5601" target="_blank">01:33:21.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And what I was going to say is there's probably at least 70 or 80 other psychoactive components to marijuana, not most of them as in higher concentration as the THC or CBD, but they're out there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5614" target="_blank">01:33:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe they are more important even at lower concentrations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5617" target="_blank">01:33:37.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I've heard this, that for some people, cannabis can help them focus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5622" target="_blank">01:33:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm certainly not one of those, but it certainly is interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5627" target="_blank">01:33:47.800</a></span> | <span class="t">As long as we're on cannabis, excuse me, as long as we're discussing cannabis, neither of us are on cannabis to my knowledge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5634" target="_blank">01:33:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe I could just ping you for kind of the relationship between various compounds that people use that are available over the counter or with, you know, sort of online access to these compounds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5649" target="_blank">01:34:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And ADHD symptoms specifically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5653" target="_blank">01:34:13.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And then at some point I'd like to return to the, the amphetamine based drugs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5658" target="_blank">01:34:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's just start with nicotine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5661" target="_blank">01:34:21.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So these days there's increased use of nicotine pouches, gums, not just smoking, vaping, dipping and snuffing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5668" target="_blank">01:34:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's certainly a stimulant and certainly a lot of people in particular young males are using it more often.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5678" target="_blank">01:34:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">This, the traditional media is now trying to create this kind of picture of nicotine being part of the kind of wellness and fitness community.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5685" target="_blank">01:34:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But in my observation, many, many more people outside of the, that category are using it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5694" target="_blank">01:34:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So what in your experience happens when somebody with ADHD, let's assume they're not medicating in any other way, starts dabbling in nicotine use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5704" target="_blank">01:35:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And let's assume they're going to do this in ways that do not cause cancer because the smoking, dipping, vaping, snuffing part is what causes the cancer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5712" target="_blank">01:35:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's just talk about the compound nicotine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5714" target="_blank">01:35:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5715" target="_blank">01:35:15.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's some well done research showing nicotine is helpful for improving some of the executive functions, sustained attention.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5724" target="_blank">01:35:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm not sure which, which of the executive functions, but they help people focus, be sharper, do better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5731" target="_blank">01:35:31.800</a></span> | <span class="t">There was actually a major pharmaceutical company who was developing a nicotine receptor product specifically for ADHD.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5739" target="_blank">01:35:39.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And they abandoned that several years ago, and I haven't been able to find word as to why that was abandoned, whether there was some other side effect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5749" target="_blank">01:35:49.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It's worth throwing out there that although nicotine in many ways acts like a stimulant, it actually is moderately unique.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5758" target="_blank">01:35:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And I hate people who say unique means one of a kind, so I can't say, I can't modify it in any way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5764" target="_blank">01:36:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It's unusual, maybe not the only one, unusual in that it both arouses people and reduces anxiety simultaneously.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5773" target="_blank">01:36:13.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Not too many, most of our stimulants are, again, banging away at the sympathetic nervous system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5779" target="_blank">01:36:19.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's banging away on good arousal and bad arousal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5783" target="_blank">01:36:23.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So nicotine, again, seems to be both calming and helping alert or focus people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5792" target="_blank">01:36:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And as long as they're taking it in a way that's not clearly detrimental to their health, which smoking and vaping and probably chewing are, well, not probably, definitely are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5804" target="_blank">01:36:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And if it's affordable, because some of these products are pretty pricey, at least the chewing gums or the Nicorette that was used for helping people with smoking cessation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5814" target="_blank">01:36:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I have some people who feel that it's been an important and useful part of their regimen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5819" target="_blank">01:36:59.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I have some people, small numbers, who prefer it to any other medications.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5824" target="_blank">01:37:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And almost no, again, other than sort of the basic neurophysiology showing that it can have beneficial effects on executive functions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5834" target="_blank">01:37:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">there's no research, at least as of a year or two ago, whenever I dipped my toe, not my anything else into the snuff, looked into it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5846" target="_blank">01:37:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">There's no clinical research showing does this help or not help.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5851" target="_blank">01:37:31.800</a></span> | <span class="t">What about caffeine and, in particular, energy drinks?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5856" target="_blank">01:37:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">These days, there just seems to be an explosion of drinks that include caffeine, but also fairly high dosages of things like taurine, alpha-GPC, theanine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5867" target="_blank">01:37:47.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Tyrosine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5868" target="_blank">01:37:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, tyrosine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5869" target="_blank">01:37:49.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, things that are thought to generally amplify the production or release of neuromodulators like dopamine, acetylcholine, and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5880" target="_blank">01:38:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the epidemiologists say that the most widely used psychoactive substance on this planet, and I thought it was alcohol for years, but it's actually caffeine, because lots of groups outlaw alcohol who won't outlaw caffeine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5895" target="_blank">01:38:15.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So lots and lots of people use it, and this is a gross oversimplification, but this is what I tell people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5902" target="_blank">01:38:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Even though it's most widely used, if you used it as an equivalent dose to our stimulants, I mean, essentially we're using it at a lower dose level.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5912" target="_blank">01:38:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a pretty lousy stimulant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5914" target="_blank">01:38:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, separate from that it's working primarily on adenosine and indirectly working on dopamine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5919" target="_blank">01:38:39.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But associated with higher levels of anxiety, higher levels of jitteriness, higher levels of cardiac toxicity, if you were to use it at an equivalent dose.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5929" target="_blank">01:38:49.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But most people are using it at a substantially lower dose, and the ADHD experts sort of historically have fallen into two different camps.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5938" target="_blank">01:38:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Some of them have said, "It's going to interact with your stimulant or other medications.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5946" target="_blank">01:39:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It's complicated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5948" target="_blank">01:39:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">We don't want it messing up the picture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5950" target="_blank">01:39:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Stay off of it."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5951" target="_blank">01:39:11.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And the other half say, "It's a stimulant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5953" target="_blank">01:39:13.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, lots of people are using it with these other stimulants, you know, both full-blown stimulants and non-stimulant ADHD medications.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5960" target="_blank">01:39:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And as long as you know it's part of the picture and you're trying to be constant with your dosage or aware of it, then fine, and maybe it helps you get away with the lower dose of the prescription.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5972" target="_blank">01:39:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">The one little piece I'd add in there is that often you don't know what dose you're getting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5977" target="_blank">01:39:37.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So people have the common experience, as I was saying earlier, I've only had three cups of coffee in my whole life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5982" target="_blank">01:39:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is all anecdotal or research, not personal experience data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5987" target="_blank">01:39:47.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But lots of people have the experience, go to their local Starbucks or something and say, "Whoa, that feels way stronger than usual."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5994" target="_blank">01:39:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And then invariably they say, "Oh, that must just be me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5998" target="_blank">01:39:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm more anxious already.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=5999" target="_blank">01:39:59.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm jacked up."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6000" target="_blank">01:40:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Or, because they think Starbucks, you know, seven billion stores around the country, everything's automated and precise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6008" target="_blank">01:40:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">They must be, Starbucks isn't, you know, they control for the aromaticity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6013" target="_blank">01:40:13.800</a></span> | <span class="t">They, how many minutes each bean is cooked, which side it gets flipped over on, they're not controlling for caffeine intake, which is wild to you and me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6022" target="_blank">01:40:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So the University of Florida study, and this is several years ago now, went into a Florida Starbucks, bought the same drink every day for three weeks, and compared the caffeine content, the highest day compared to the lowest days was a three-fold difference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6039" target="_blank">01:40:39.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Wow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6040" target="_blank">01:40:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's Starbucks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6041" target="_blank">01:40:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's Starbucks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6042" target="_blank">01:40:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Who knows what smaller, so one is, you may think you know what you're giving, and maybe, you know, the bane of coffee drinkers, and maybe Sanka in a teaspoon that you're dissolving may be the most consistent there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6057" target="_blank">01:40:57.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But one of the risks with caffeine, and with pretty much any over-the-counter drug, is you may not know what dose you're getting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6066" target="_blank">01:41:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Very interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6066" target="_blank">01:41:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, I, as I've said several times in this podcast, I think caffeine is a wonderful drug, mostly because I love the things that comes in, yerba mate being my, you know, preferred source of caffeine, but also coffee.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6079" target="_blank">01:41:19.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And it certainly increases my focus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6082" target="_blank">01:41:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a narrow plane though, you know, two sips too many, and I can start feeling myself veer toward more lack of focus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6089" target="_blank">01:41:29.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It doesn't seem to have a very pervasive effect, and dosing it on an empty stomach versus after eating, I mean, I'm not that precise about it, but I don't see it as a very reliable stimulant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6106" target="_blank">01:41:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It's more to get to a plane of just normalcy for me, given how much I've been drinking it since I was a teen, really.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6112" target="_blank">01:41:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I think most people are similar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6114" target="_blank">01:41:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">They drink it to feel normal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6116" target="_blank">01:41:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, there's lots of, well, and there's also lots of cultural and habitual, you know, if it makes, gives you your warm fuzzies, or puts you in the right mode, or you're sure you think you're more alert, or you're listening to your favorite newscast in the morning as you're drinking it, that all is adding to its effect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6135" target="_blank">01:42:15.800</a></span> | <span class="t">In terms of combining with other over-the-counter things, there is some study looking at caffeine and L-theanine together, and having some, at least in a tiny handful of studies, some measurable beneficial effect on, I think it's mostly kids that have been looked at, and nothing dangerous found across a pretty broad range of L-theanine dosages.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6160" target="_blank">01:42:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's, I mean, I'm not aware of any good research done with adding all the other things that are currently being added to it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6168"

it seems to take the jitters off, and the assumption being that people can consume more of that drink as a consequence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

dampen down, you know, help with anxiety, but it may directly have some beneficial cognitive executive function benefits itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6200" target="_blank">01:43:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, this is in keeping with the green tea hypothesis, which I believe green tea is enriched for theanine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6208" target="_blank">01:43:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You are somebody who, quite refreshingly to me, has talked not just about prescription drugs and behavioral tools for ADHD, but also, actually, I think years ago, you were the first person to first share with me the data about fish oil and the EPA omega-3s for depression.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6230" target="_blank">01:43:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, those studies were starting to come out, we were talking about those studies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6234" target="_blank">01:43:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And nowadays, I think, while there's still a little bit of controversy out there about fish oils, I think most everybody believes that getting high-quality omega-3s from good, clean sources, including fish oil, is mostly beneficial or beneficial.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6250" target="_blank">01:44:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">What about fish oil for ADHD in particular, and what threshold dosages are relevant here?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6260" target="_blank">01:44:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So just as with the fish oil for cardiac benefits, you know, there was a time period where the first few large, and they were pretty large, well-done studies showed benefits for cardiovascular health.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6272" target="_blank">01:44:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">The more recent studies with fish oil haven't shown an effect or benefit, and strangely to me, and not very scientifically, the cardiology community sort of looks at the more recent ones and says, "Okay, that's what it is."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6285" target="_blank">01:44:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, you have to reconcile all the data in the pool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6289" target="_blank">01:44:49.800</a></span> | <span class="t">The ADHD fish oil story is a little the opposite, and it's been, it's almost everything with ADHD, it's been kids that have been most strongly looked at.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6300" target="_blank">01:45:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">The first few studies with fish oil in kids didn't show any benefits at all, and then subsequently, there have been several studies that looked at benefits.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6310" target="_blank">01:45:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, and the field jumps to the second set without reconciling, well, how do we, you know, do a good meta-analysis with everything in there?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6320" target="_blank">01:45:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And I haven't looked closely enough to know, you know, were there methodological differences, dosage differences, population differences that matter?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6328" target="_blank">01:45:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I'd say unless you're taking so big a dose that you're probably at risk for heavy metal poisoning, which is a possible issue with big, big, big doses of fish oil.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6340" target="_blank">01:45:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, most of the recommendations are in the range that it seems, and I'd say that depression has been the most consistent field.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6350" target="_blank">01:45:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And that doesn't mean every study there has been positive either, but the most consistent field for a mental health benefit or a health benefit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6358" target="_blank">01:45:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And there, the recommendation is usually target about 1,000 milligrams of EPA of icosapentaenoic acid a day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6368" target="_blank">01:46:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're seeing some benefit, but it feels like there's more room for improvement, so this is my model, I tell people, then you could probably double it reasonably.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6378" target="_blank">01:46:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, some of the dramatic, there were dramatic studies looking at fish oil for mania, people hospitalized with it, but, and they used dosages as high as 7,000 milligrams a day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6391" target="_blank">01:46:31.800</a></span> | <span class="t">To treat mania?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6392" target="_blank">01:46:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6393" target="_blank">01:46:33.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And that study, I think it was a Harvard area clinic that was doing it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6399" target="_blank">01:46:39.800</a></span> | <span class="t">The results were so dramatic that they ethically had to stop the study before its intended completion, because the benefits seem to be so robust in the fish oil group compared to the, that it was unethical to not put everyone on fish oil.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6413" target="_blank">01:46:53.800</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a lot of fish oil.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6414" target="_blank">01:46:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's a lot of, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6415" target="_blank">01:46:55.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You probably need to get it in liquid form to make it, you know, so it wasn't so expensive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6421" target="_blank">01:47:01.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But I find this recency effect incredible that you meant, you know, which you mentioned a few moments ago that, and I think this is helpful for people to hear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6430" target="_blank">01:47:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Certainly it is for me, you know, we hear, you know, studies over the years have explored fish oil for cardiac benefits.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6437" target="_blank">01:47:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And then more recently, as I understand, you know, these are not, have not been demonstrated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6443" target="_blank">01:47:23.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And there seems to be a

target="_blank">01:47:27.800</a></span> | <span class="t">That's essentially what you described for both cardiac and ADHD.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6451" target="_blank">01:47:31.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's really important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6453" target="_blank">01:47:33.800</a></span> | <span class="t">We hear this with alcohol too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

care of themselves and others.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6460" target="_blank">01:47:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you're an alcoholic adult, don't drink.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6462" target="_blank">01:47:42.800</a></span> | <span

out showing a mild benefit of moderate alcohol use,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6473" target="_blank">01:47:53.800</a></span> |

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6483" target="_blank">01:48:03.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think it's important to understand that people hear that that's not always the case.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6487" target="_blank">01:48:07.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Just because there's a

target="_blank">01:48:11.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm just restating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6493"

target="_blank">01:48:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I make it a point to try and get one to two grams of EPA per day, just as a general mood.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6500" target="_blank">01:48:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I'm not clinically depressed, but just to support my mood, to support focus, to support well-being, including cardiac function.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6507" target="_blank">01:48:27.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6508" target="_blank">01:48:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So the other thing that I think is understudied with the fish oil issue is that, and it's a Harvard guy who has a proprietary brand of purified EPA that pushes it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6521" target="_blank">01:48:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So in nature, whether you're a whale or a human or a butterfly or maybe not insects, I'm not sure of that, across the mammal, bird, reptile kingdom, the omega-3s are found in about a two-to-one ratio of EPA to DHA.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6537" target="_blank">01:48:57.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And what I tell people is I think Mother Nature is probably smarter than any Harvard professor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6546" target="_blank">01:49:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And the brain particularly is high in the brain membranes of DHA.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6552" target="_blank">01:49:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So I don't see, some people seek out EPA purified or sole, you know, only EPA brands.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6563" target="_blank">01:49:23.800</a></span> | <span class="t">That to me doesn't make a lot of sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6565" target="_blank">01:49:25.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So I would say we can still count or do the numbering based on about a thousand milligrams of EPA, but don't worry that you're getting about 300, 400 milligrams of DHA.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6575" target="_blank">01:49:35.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And probably that's better for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

that by just saying it's complicated and probably important and so many variables that it's hard to know what's really valuable</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6775" target="_blank">01:52:55.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Before we go back to some drugs, I wanted to ask about behavioral tools for ADHD.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6784" target="_blank">01:53:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I've seen some of the literature claiming that certain video games might actually be useful for training focus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6791" target="_blank">01:53:11.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I've managed to find a few papers that talk about focus and meditation tasks that kids in particular, but adults may be able to get better at.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6803" target="_blank">01:53:23.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, are any of these brain training games to get people better at focusing?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6807" target="_blank">01:53:27.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Are any of them known to be worthwhile according to like real data or clinical observation?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6812" target="_blank">01:53:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'll start by stepping back a little bit and broadening it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6818" target="_blank">01:53:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll get to the video game things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6820" target="_blank">01:53:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But one of the effective approaches that helps with symptomatic reduction with ADHD is cognitive behavioral therapy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6828" target="_blank">01:53:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's a form of talking therapy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6830" target="_blank">01:53:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And my quick overview of it is that it focuses on actions, thoughts, and feelings, and that humans can have direct control of their actions and thoughts, not too much over their feelings, but all three are affecting each other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6845" target="_blank">01:54:05.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And the traditional CBT was developed by Aaron Beck to treat depression probably 50 years ago, maybe longer, 60s, I think, late 60s.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6857" target="_blank">01:54:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Anyway, on the surface, it's a horrible match for ADHD because we know it requires lots of repetitive, boring homework, doing the same thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6867" target="_blank">01:54:27.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It involves introspection of being aware of what you're doing already, looking at those patterns, looking at what the triggers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6874" target="_blank">01:54:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, to see if you can see triggers for them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6877" target="_blank">01:54:37.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And then doing lots and lots of repetitive homework, which and when it's successful for depression or PTSD or other venues, we know it actually changes brain wiring and brain chemistry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6890" target="_blank">01:54:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So lots of people still think talking therapies are sort of up here doing something and chemicals and medications are really changing the brain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6898" target="_blank">01:54:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">If your thoughts are changing, if your behavior is changing, your brain has changed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6903" target="_blank">01:55:03.800</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the only place that thoughts and behaviors come from.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6908" target="_blank">01:55:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So the two groups, Mary Solanto's in New York and Harvard group by, I'm blanking on his first, Saffron and some other, Ramsey at Pennsylvania, developed approaches using CBT techniques specifically designed for people with ADHD to help overcome some of those hurdles and barriers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6929" target="_blank">01:55:29.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And both of them encourage actually the use of medications in combination with it because many people with ADHD are too unfocused, too unable to sit down and do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6941" target="_blank">01:55:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But these are approaches, and both approaches are amazingly similar, although devised completely independently, at the core of both of those approaches is having a system of scheduling each day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6953" target="_blank">01:55:53.800</a></span> | <span class="t">That doesn't mean micromanaging each minute, but it's having the essentials in place, having blocks of time that you know what you're going to do, and having a task list in combination with that, and ways of learning to prioritize and move things up or down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6970" target="_blank">01:56:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, with ADHD being interest-driven rather than importance-driven, you may have a task list.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6976" target="_blank">01:56:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, you probably have a task list.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6977" target="_blank">01:56:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, you probably have 17 task lists.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6978" target="_blank">01:56:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">One's New York coffee.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6979" target="_blank">01:56:19.800</a></span> | <span class="t">One's at the grocery store.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6981" target="_blank">01:56:21.800</a></span> | <span class="t">One, it's having one consolidated list because if it's everywhere, then it's nowhere.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6987" target="_blank">01:56:27.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And two is the simplest triaging or organizing approach is having the things that are both urgent and important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=6999" target="_blank">01:56:39.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So if it happens to happen today, those get in the A category.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7004" target="_blank">01:56:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">The things that are important but aren't as urgent are the B category, and all the other things are the C.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7010" target="_blank">01:56:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of the temptations that people with ADHD have is, oh, I need to be productive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7015" target="_blank">01:56:55.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, it's fun to go buy shoelaces, and that's on my list, so I'll go to buy shoelaces because then I can cross something off my list.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7023" target="_blank">01:57:03.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But I didn't move the car.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7025" target="_blank">01:57:05.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I didn't do my taxes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7026" target="_blank">01:57:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I haven't done my homework.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7028" target="_blank">01:57:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, all the important things remain undone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7030" target="_blank">01:57:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's a system for getting done what's really needed to be done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7034" target="_blank">01:57:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, eventually if your shoes don't work, the shoelaces will move up to that A category.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7041" target="_blank">01:57:21.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But for most people, they're not really there, and it's not a good use of your time to do them first.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7046" target="_blank">01:57:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's much more to it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7049" target="_blank">01:57:29.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So the CBT approach can work with decreasing procrastination.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7054" target="_blank">01:57:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It can help with structuring your own workspace given that you probably have much more trouble doing that and not doing it spontaneously.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7063" target="_blank">01:57:43.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It's how to eliminate distractions and modules on even extending your concentration time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7071" target="_blank">01:57:51.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So the answer with the video games, there is one product that's actually been FDA approved for use in ADHD.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7078" target="_blank">01:57:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And the really important thing to remember there is the FDA's system for addressing medications is much more rigorous, much more thorough.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7090" target="_blank">01:58:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You have to demonstrate it really works and does something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7093" target="_blank">01:58:13.800</a></span> | <span class="t">When the FDA approves devices, basically they're saying it's not going to kill anyone, it might help.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7100" target="_blank">01:58:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, it might help tremendously, but having the FDA imprimatur for that doesn't guarantee that or mean that at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7108" target="_blank">01:58:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you recall if the study of that device or the study of that video game has a conflict of interest, was it run by the company?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7115" target="_blank">01:58:35.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so almost all of them have been run by the company.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7118" target="_blank">01:58:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, it's good people at UCSF who are at least partly involved in it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7123" target="_blank">01:58:43.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, is this Adam Gazzelli's group?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7125" target="_blank">01:58:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I think so.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7126" target="_blank">01:58:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I should just say that I've followed his work for some years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7130" target="_blank">01:58:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">He's a neuroscientist.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7131" target="_blank">01:58:51.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I know people who have been in his lab.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7133" target="_blank">01:58:53.800</a></span> | <span class="t">He's known for doing very, very high quality and stringent work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7137" target="_blank">01:58:57.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Their product and some of the others can clearly show you get better at their product and you get better at tests that look exactly like their product.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7147" target="_blank">01:59:07.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But in terms of real world, how much is this really helping ADHD symptoms on a day-to-day basis?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7154" target="_blank">01:59:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">There's not a lot of data at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7157" target="_blank">01:59:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, that doesn't mean it doesn't work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7159" target="_blank">01:59:19.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm going to go sideways and talking about neurofeedback because there's lots and lots of neurofeedback companies across the country that are making lots and lots of money.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7170" target="_blank">01:59:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And there was an article in the American Journal of Psychiatry in the last year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7175" target="_blank">01:59:35.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not remembering which group did it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7178" target="_blank">01:59:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was another failure to find a significant impact from neurofeedback.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7186" target="_blank">01:59:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, I'm not saying it doesn't have an effect, but I had lots of people writing me, should I keep spending hundreds of dollars each week because my insurance isn't covering this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7197" target="_blank">01:59:57.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And the doctor is saying, oh, maybe 20 more episodes will retrain your brain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7204" target="_blank">02:00:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So this gets back to a topic you brought up earlier, how much are we retraining our brains with immersion in social media?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7213" target="_blank">02:00:13.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And the evidence is we are rewiring our brains.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7216" target="_blank">02:00:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So maybe anything pushing in an opposite direction or maybe this is reinforcing some of the bad things we don't want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7223"

has helped tremendously in segregating that activity and limiting it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7246" target="_blank">02:00:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It also means that people send me something which would otherwise direct me to social media.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7252" target="_blank">02:00:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It's much more difficult for me to go look it up.</span></div><div class="c"><span

restrict my social media time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7260" target="_blank">02:01:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And yet still be, you know, in keeping with the fact that I think social media has its uses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7265"

target="_blank">02:01:07.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So getting back to the scheduling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7269" target="_blank">02:01:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, what I recommend to people and one of my weekends, I don't know the specific apps, but there are apps that will help shut you out of Facebook or Discord or TikTok or whatever it is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7280" target="_blank">02:01:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">If you can't exert your own willpower, which again is harder to do if you have ADHD.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7285" target="_blank">02:01:25.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And if the app approach doesn't work, the next level up is there are all sorts of companies making lock boxes and physical devices where you can lock yourself out to your device for certain hours of the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7299" target="_blank">02:01:39.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that's a good idea for lots of people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7303" target="_blank">02:01:43.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I do too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7304" target="_blank">02:01:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think it also helps at least in my experience to do things that are very different than social media as well, but still consuming content.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7313" target="_blank">02:01:53.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So I make it a point to read from an actual physical book a bit each day or night.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7318" target="_blank">02:01:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Also, because I was raised doing that and writing by hand is just over in keeping with the way that my brain was was wired.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7325" target="_blank">02:02:05.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So maybe that's more specific to me and my generation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7328" target="_blank">02:02:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But I find that when I'm doing those other activities, when I go onto social media, it feels more like a departure from the rest of life as opposed to the other way around.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7341" target="_blank">02:02:21.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But that's a good sign for preserving.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7344" target="_blank">02:02:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I'd like to talk about some compounds that are not so typical, meaning some people may have heard of these, but most people probably haven't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7355" target="_blank">02:02:35.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And they are somewhat novel to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7357" target="_blank">02:02:37.800</a></span> | <span class="t">The first one is guanfacine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7360" target="_blank">02:02:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">What is guanfacine and why is it sometimes used for ADHD?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7365" target="_blank">02:02:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So guanfacine and a related drug called clonidine, which can be confused with clonopin and others.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7374" target="_blank">02:02:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So clonidine and guanfacine are both alpha-2 agonists.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7377" target="_blank">02:02:57.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So they work on a subset of the norepinephrine system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7380" target="_blank">02:03:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">They're both originally antihypertensive for lowering blood pressure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7385" target="_blank">02:03:05.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was actually studies first in clonidine that suggested this could be helpful with people with ADHD.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7392" target="_blank">02:03:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think it was just a serendipitous initial discovery.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7395" target="_blank">02:03:15.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It wasn't seeking out its mode of action to see if that really worked.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7400" target="_blank">02:03:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">One difference between the two of them is clonidine jumps off the norepinephrine alpha-2 receptor really quickly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7407" target="_blank">02:03:27.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And for people who skip a dose with their blood pressure medication or stop abruptly, it's not uncommon to have rebound hypertension.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7419" target="_blank">02:03:39.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And not just mild, but way higher than what you're being originally treated for to dangerous levels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7424" target="_blank">02:03:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Guanfacine leaves the receptors more slowly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7428" target="_blank">02:03:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And there have been formal studies trying to see if this is a problem or issue there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7432" target="_blank">02:03:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And particularly given that people with ADHD forget their medication or run out and don't fill it in time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7437" target="_blank">02:03:57.800</a></span> | <span class="t">or just don't remember to take it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7439" target="_blank">02:03:59.800</a></span> | <span class="t">The rebound hypertension does not seem to be nearly as common with guanfacine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7445" target="_blank">02:04:05.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's part of why the research has moved more towards the guanfacine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7452" target="_blank">02:04:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's extensive work by, I'm going to blank on her, Amy Arden, she's at Yale.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7460" target="_blank">02:04:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, Arnston.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7461" target="_blank">02:04:21.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Arnston, thank you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7463" target="_blank">02:04:23.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And her lab and related labs have shown that guanfacine's effects seem to deal with strengthening synaptic connections in prefrontal circuitry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7474" target="_blank">02:04:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So unlike most of our drugs that are just boosting your epinephrine and/or dopamine and work quickly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7481" target="_blank">02:04:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and I'll throw in this because we didn't really touch this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7484" target="_blank">02:04:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Most of the ADHD experts still say stimulants, amphetamine, Ritalin work quickly immediately because they boost dopamine right away.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7494" target="_blank">02:04:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And our drugs like Stratera, which is Adamoxetine or Cymbalta or Wellbutrin work slowly for ADHD</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7501" target="_blank">02:05:01.800</a></span> | <span class="t">because their antidepressants and antidepressants work slowly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7504" target="_blank">02:05:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">There's still people saying this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7506" target="_blank">02:05:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And for 25 years I've been saying this is just wrong from one basic neuroscience point of view and wrong from don't you ever talk or listen to patients.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7517" target="_blank">02:05:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So neuroscience view, how quickly does dopamine reuptate get blocked by Wellbutrin or by Adamoxetine, Stratera or by Cymbalta within minutes to hours of taking it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7529" target="_blank">02:05:29.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So you would expect if you're boosting norepinephrine or dopamine availability right away, you should see effects right away.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7535" target="_blank">02:05:35.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you ask patients who these drugs work for and they don't work for anybody, all the ones I've worked with say, you know, work just like this thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7545" target="_blank">02:05:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I could tell I took it and I walked out of your office.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7548" target="_blank">02:05:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, one guy I have who loves Cymbalta said I took it near office and I wasn't sure it was working and I got downtown to work 15, 20, maybe a half hour later.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7560" target="_blank">02:06:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And there was this guy coming at me on a skateboard on the sidewalk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7564" target="_blank">02:06:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And I know in my normal ADD state, I would have just been flooded and not be able to process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7569" target="_blank">02:06:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And I could just step out of the way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7572" target="_blank">02:06:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, it worked that quickly and dramatically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7576" target="_blank">02:06:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's the aside.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7579" target="_blank">02:06:19.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So jumping back, guanfacine seems to work slowly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7582" target="_blank">02:06:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So the synaptic strengthening building.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7585" target="_blank">02:06:25.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And it seems to be the alpha-2 receptors that are on neurons that receive glutamate is our primary input.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7596" target="_blank">02:06:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">The alpha-2 receptor is modulating how glutamate is actually working.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7602" target="_blank">02:06:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's actually the NMDA glutamate receptors, not the more common in the brain AMPA glutamate receptors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7609" target="_blank">02:06:49.800</a></span> | <span class="t">No, that's an important point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7610" target="_blank">02:06:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll just quickly throw in, if I may, that the NMDA, the N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptors are the ones that typically are associated with synaptic plasticity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7621" target="_blank">02:07:01.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Although, you know, so are, you know, the AMPA receptors can do that too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7625" target="_blank">02:07:05.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But what Dr. Cruz is referring to is the fact that guanfacine, you know, indirectly modulates those pathways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7632" target="_blank">02:07:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So the longer duration to get the effect, it sounds like could be at least partially explained by a real change in neural wiring,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7643" target="_blank">02:07:23.800</a></span> | <span class="t">as opposed to with you use Cymbalta and Wellbutrin as examples of fast changes in neurotransmitters and neuromodulators that led to this very quick effect in this patient that left your office, got downtown and was already experiencing effect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7657" target="_blank">02:07:37.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Put differently, sounds like guanfacine and clonidine, not to be confused with clonopin, clonidine could help ADHD but might take longer for the effects to manifest than the other drugs that we typically hear about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7672" target="_blank">02:07:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So most often it takes two, three, four weeks and because it, I mean, with the stimulants, you see effects right away.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7678" target="_blank">02:07:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It's reinforcing and stimulants often, in addition to having effects on concentration, attention, other, you know, do boost energy for most people, do boost mood for most people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7690" target="_blank">02:08:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And can improve sleep if they're not taken too close to sleep, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7693" target="_blank">02:08:13.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Guanfacine's most common side effect tends to be sedating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7696" target="_blank">02:08:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So most people take it at night time, which is like, why are you taking a sedating night time medication for your ADHD?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7703" target="_blank">02:08:23.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It's because it helps, it works slowly, indirectly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7706" target="_blank">02:08:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So in Tuniv, the brand name extended release guanfacine was approved in kids, because again, most of the research on ADHD is still in kids.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7716" target="_blank">02:08:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">For treating ADHD as a solo agent, it clearly works in adults as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7725" target="_blank">02:08:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And even before Intuniv was approved, there were a handful of studies with either immediate release guanfacine or extended release guanfacine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7733" target="_blank">02:08:53.800</a></span> | <span class="t">In the studies so far, the results aren't distinguishable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7738" target="_blank">02:08:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, they both seem to work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7740" target="_blank">02:09:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So clinically, because it's much cheaper, I actually use immediately release form and all at bedtime.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7750" target="_blank">02:09:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, because it's my impression, and I probably don't have an end that's big enough to do a rigorous study,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7757" target="_blank">02:09:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">is the sedating effects are relegated to the nighttime and people are feeling okay during the daytime.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7764" target="_blank">02:09:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, some of the rationale with the extended release is you're sort of smearing it over a longer time, so it should be less sedating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7773" target="_blank">02:09:33.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But depending on the time curve and how it works, you could actually wind up with being more uniformly sedated day and night with the extended release.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7780" target="_blank">02:09:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So I've seen good results in some people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7783" target="_blank">02:09:43.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I've had many who either didn't work or they didn't perceive result.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7788" target="_blank">02:09:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Because again, some part for some people of the stimulant benefit is I can feel it, I know it's working.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7795" target="_blank">02:09:55.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So the majority, at least in terms of prescription searches and what clinics tend to, it looks like most people who are on guanifacine are on it in combination with either a stimulant or a norepinephrine or dopamine promoting agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7812" target="_blank">02:10:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's talk about modafinil and our modafinil by extension.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7818" target="_blank">02:10:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">We hear about modafinil a lot in communities like the tech community and communities where people are trying to quote unquote cognitively enhance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7828" target="_blank">02:10:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">What is modafinil?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7830" target="_blank">02:10:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">What does it do?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7831" target="_blank">02:10:31.800</a></span> | <span class="t">What doesn't it do?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7832" target="_blank">02:10:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">How might it be useful for ADHD?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7835" target="_blank">02:10:35.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're going to jump back to your issue with the recency in science and how to incorporate things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7841" target="_blank">02:10:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">When some modafinil was a drug developed by a French company and approved there and used for decades, for maybe a decade before it came to the US 25, maybe 35 years ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7854" target="_blank">02:10:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And at the time all the research showed that it was an orexin receptor antagonist, antagonist, agonist, works on the orexin system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7866" target="_blank">02:11:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">The hypocretin orexin system, right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7868" target="_blank">02:11:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So boosting activity but not working like all of our stimulant alerting drugs which are working on primarily norepinephrine systems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7877" target="_blank">02:11:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So it was called the non-stimulant stimulant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7880" target="_blank">02:11:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Now most of the pharmacology literature refers to it as a dopamine acting drug.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7887" target="_blank">02:11:27.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And some people are debating whether it's orexin that it's working via or dopamine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7892" target="_blank">02:11:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I haven't seen anything that to me gives a clear consensus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7899" target="_blank">02:11:39.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So I stick with the orexin because that's where I was taught.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7903" target="_blank">02:11:43.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So orexin, getting back to the sleep-wake and the brain and arousal, as I describe it, there's two ways to wake up in the morning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7910" target="_blank">02:11:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">One way is the normal way that you just wake up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7914" target="_blank">02:11:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And the other is being alarmed by an alarm clock, your neighbor starting their lawnmower, someone snoring, earthquake if you're in LA or Hawaii, being startled out of sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7928" target="_blank">02:12:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">That wakefulness system is the sympathetic nervous system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7932" target="_blank">02:12:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">The orexin system is the more natural, normal waking system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7937" target="_blank">02:12:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And it isn't arousing you, it's waking you, but it's not agitating you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7942" target="_blank">02:12:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, the claims originally was that this is how Modafinil worked.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7946" target="_blank">02:12:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It was waking you up, but not overstimulating over-revenue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7951" target="_blank">02:12:31.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So other than being developed by this French company, the entity that spent most research funds looking into what this does or doesn't do was the US military.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7961" target="_blank">02:12:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Because they have a big investment in wanting people to be alert and ready to kill 24/7, but not being hyperactive trigger-happy jittery like stimulants can do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7973" target="_blank">02:12:53.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And this, you know, particularly in the early days, this is really dating me of the Afghan war.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7978" target="_blank">02:12:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">We dropped bombs on Canadian troops by accident, you know, friendly fire scenario things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7985" target="_blank">02:13:05.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And the investigation, the pilot and the crew there blamed their trigger happiness on being revved up by methylphenidate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=7995" target="_blank">02:13:15.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So for years, the military has relied on traditional stimulants to keep people able to fight around the clock.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8003" target="_blank">02:13:23.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And they wanted an agent that would keep you alert, awake, but not revved up, not agitated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8010" target="_blank">02:13:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'd say there's some good evidence that that's really sort of how Modafinil works or performs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8018" target="_blank">02:13:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So Modafinil was called ProVigil for ProVigilance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8022" target="_blank">02:13:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And then when they were losing their US patent, like many drugs, the ProVigil is a racemic mixture of left-handed and right-handed versions of the same Modafinil molecule.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8033" target="_blank">02:13:53.800</a></span> | <span class="t">They found that the R Modafinil, the right-handed version, was the one that's doing most of the good stuff and has a longer half-life than the combined version.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8043" target="_blank">02:14:03.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So they got a new patent for our Modafinil, which is new Vigil.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8048" target="_blank">02:14:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's the only difference between the two.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8051" target="_blank">02:14:11.800</a></span> | <span class="t">They're the same active ingredients, as far as we can tell.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8054" target="_blank">02:14:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And when it got approval in the US, it was approved for narcolepsy, where people are falling abruptly asleep during the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8062" target="_blank">02:14:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So it keeps them alert and awake there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8064" target="_blank">02:14:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It also got approval for circadian sleep shift work disorder, where because you're on a shift schedule, you're sleeping weirdly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8074" target="_blank">02:14:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And it got approval for daytime sleepiness from sleep apnea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8078" target="_blank">02:14:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But even at that time when it was approved, there were dozens of studies that showed, regardless of why you're sleepy, whether it was sedating medication, whether you had lupus or MS, whether you had some other condition, it works pretty well for keeping people alert and awake.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8096" target="_blank">02:14:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So more than keeping alert and awake, there does seem to be evidence that it helps with some of the executive functions of attention, concentration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8105" target="_blank">02:15:05.800</a></span> | <span class="t">My clinical experience with it tends to be, again, with the amphetamine on top, many fewer people describe it as being helpful or as helpful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8119" target="_blank">02:15:19.800</a></span> | <span class="t">On the other hand, there's one study, and I'm forgetting the principal investigators, it was at Brown University, where they used some very clever, sophisticated approach to try to sort out motivation versus pure cognitive functioning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8134" target="_blank">02:15:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And their claim, and it was a very well done study, they were comparing it directly to an amphetamine product.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8141" target="_blank">02:15:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Their claim was that modafinil was the one that was actually boosting cognitive functions and not just boosting motivation, whereas that most of amphetamines benefit for ADHD when we say it helps me concentrate, it helps me sustain focus, it makes me less distracted.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8160" target="_blank">02:16:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And their feeling, their analysis was that stimulant was mostly working on motivation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8167" target="_blank">02:16:07.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a controlled substance, but not nearly, not the same schedule as amphetamine and Ritalin, so it's easier for some prescribers to prescribe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8177" target="_blank">02:16:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So even though it's the non-stimulant stimulant, and I'd say most people do experience, you know, I feel more alert or awake or better, but I don't feel revved up, about 10 to 15% of people that I've worked with, and others have written about it so I don't think it's unique, will feel revved up when they take it the first few times.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8197" target="_blank">02:16:37.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And invariably the people I've worked with have said, this feels like bad speed, including people who haven't too, who never even took speed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8207" target="_blank">02:16:47.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So I don't know why they came up, I mean, it's just weird that people come up with the same terms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8212" target="_blank">02:16:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's, I mean, my interpretation is that for some people, this novel substance, primarily maybe tacking into the orexin system, is serving as a signal kind of like a panic attack does, that there's something weird, something different, we're being revved up, and that it's, I think, secondarily triggering the sympathetic system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8233" target="_blank">02:17:13.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Because for most of those people, within a few trials, within a few days, they no longer had that over revved effect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8241" target="_blank">02:17:21.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, the important piece for alerting people to that is if they're expecting taking this, I'm not going to feel over roused and over agitated, and they do, then they're even less prepared and more freaked out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8255" target="_blank">02:17:35.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Even though I've never tried Modafinil ProVigil, that people that I know who have, and I know one who has for treatment of real narcolepsy, so he's narcoleptic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8267" target="_blank">02:17:47.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But others who have, take it for ADHD and for work focus and cognitive enhancement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8273" target="_blank">02:17:53.800</a></span> | <span class="t">People who take Modafinil and our Modafinil really like it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8279" target="_blank">02:17:59.800</a></span> | <span class="t">They, I don't know if it has any reinforcing property, but today's the first that I've heard that has this dopaminergic aspect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8286" target="_blank">02:18:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But they seem to really like it and rely on it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8289" target="_blank">02:18:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Have you seen a kind of a dependence form?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8291" target="_blank">02:18:11.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, it is a controlled substance because some people are worried about the potential.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8297" target="_blank">02:18:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And there was a little woman Olympic athlete, 20, 15 years ago, who was admirable and said she had narcolepsy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8305"

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8333" target="_blank">02:18:53.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'd say it's, to me, not the concluded subject, whether there's any potential for addiction with it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8341" target="_blank">02:19:01.800</a></span> | <span class="t">What about within the category of Adderall, Vyvanse, and the stimulant type treatments for ADHD?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8349" target="_blank">02:19:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't want to say what are your go-to favorites, because that makes it sound very non-clinical.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8355" target="_blank">02:19:15.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, what are the general trends that you've observed and that others have observed clinically or in any studies about preference for long-acting drugs versus shorter-acting drugs?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8369" target="_blank">02:19:29.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And maybe this is also a good opportunity for you to be able to chime in about drug holidays, you know, taking weekends off or things of that sort.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8381" target="_blank">02:19:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll start with that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8382" target="_blank">02:19:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So, for decades, particularly starting with the kids, the dogma has been taking breaks from stimulants is a good idea because it will decrease the likelihood of developing addictions, it will decrease tolerance, and not a lot of rigorous research.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8400" target="_blank">02:20:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But one of the known side effects of stimulants for kids is growth suppression.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8406" target="_blank">02:20:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So, height winds up being about two centimeters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8409" target="_blank">02:20:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Not big, but measurably and consistently found there for kids who are routinely on these stimulants for their growth years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8419" target="_blank">02:20:19.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And taking breaks that last for several months, like taking off during the summer, result in overcoming that decrement in height.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8431" target="_blank">02:20:31.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I looked, and I still haven't, whether there's any lower rate of addiction, whether there's any lower rate of developing tolerance, there's nothing that shows clinically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8441" target="_blank">02:20:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, it may be true.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8442" target="_blank">02:20:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So, the other recommendation when I started out was, and this is before the internet, before constant plugged into everything, and before kids had soccer practice and violin lessons and 400 activities, is that kids should take it during the work days and not take it during the weekends and not take it during the summers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8460" target="_blank">02:21:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And now, and for many years, we've lived in a world where little Johnny has soccer practice and ballet and piano and has 42 things to get to where he's supposed to be performing and focused and behaving.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8476" target="_blank">02:21:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So, the sort of excuse you could have downtime has diminished in many communities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8483" target="_blank">02:21:23.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, whether there's actual benefits to that or not, other than for the height decrement, which again, there is evidence that taking long breaks, but probably not short breaks, mitigates that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8497" target="_blank">02:21:37.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I haven't seen any evidence clearly showing a benefit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8501" target="_blank">02:21:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">That doesn't mean it's not there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8503" target="_blank">02:21:43.800</a></span> | <span class="t">He's really studied it rigorously.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8506" target="_blank">02:21:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Sort of related to that, you asked the question about short acting versus long acting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8512" target="_blank">02:21:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's differences in the realm of what's clinically helpful or useful, and then there's the issue of risks or side effects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8520" target="_blank">02:22:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, one of the claims is that part of what makes a drug more addictive is not just the level it reaches, but how quickly it's going in and out, and that the short acting drugs may predispose someone to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8532" target="_blank">02:22:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">or someone to higher rates of addiction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8535" target="_blank">02:22:15.800</a></span> | <span class="t">There are, at least occasionally, some people arguing on the other side, that saturating the receptors for longer periods of time, but high doses with long extended release version, that may actually be more of a risk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8549" target="_blank">02:22:29.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But I'd say there's more concern, I think, in the basic science community from the immediate real risk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8556" target="_blank">02:22:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's a tiny bit of data, but part of it overall is that we talked earlier about global rates of addiction to any substance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8565" target="_blank">02:22:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">That we have fairly good data on because the CDC tracks it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8570" target="_blank">02:22:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But in terms of very specifically, who gets addicted to Adderall, who gets addicted to Ritalin, there's so little data, and most people just sort the same numbers that, oh, maybe 2% to 3% of kids run into trouble, and it's not common, and that's it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8587" target="_blank">02:23:07.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Or they study a much broader question, and that's the issue of misuse combined with abuse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8594" target="_blank">02:23:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And misuse, by the research definitions, means anyone who didn't use their drug exactly as prescribed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8602" target="_blank">02:23:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Which means if you're taking a short-acting Ritalin, and it says take it one every six hours apart during the day, and you acknowledge taking it on one day eight hours difference, you're classified as a misuser by those studies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8617" target="_blank">02:23:37.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, I'm being maybe a little ridiculous, because most of the exceptions aren't that narrow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8624" target="_blank">02:23:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's a big blurring in the research, particularly coming from the people who are worried about addiction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8630" target="_blank">02:23:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, we should be worried about addiction, but we shouldn't be overreacting or creating, pretending it's a problem among those where that, I would say, is not addiction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8643" target="_blank">02:24:03.800</a></span> | <span class="t">That's not abuse, that's not using it as directed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8647" target="_blank">02:24:07.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But people with ADHD, by their very nature, are not going to use things as directed, either because they forgot or weren't organized enough to get it on time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8658" target="_blank">02:24:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">or forgot what you said in the office, even though you wrote it down because they lost the sheet of paper it's written down on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8664" target="_blank">02:24:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So getting back to patients' experience of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8667" target="_blank">02:24:27.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So the advantages of the immediate release is they tend to work quickly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8671" target="_blank">02:24:31.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You can feel it going in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8673" target="_blank">02:24:33.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It's easily, most people, there's a lot of individual variability, but let's say in the six to eight hour range we'll get benefit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8682" target="_blank">02:24:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Some shorter, some immediate release lasts all day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8686" target="_blank">02:24:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But you know when it's on, you know when it's off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8689" target="_blank">02:24:49.800</a></span> | <span class="t">If you forget to take your medicines in the morning, but you know you have a presentation at three that afternoon, you could take it at two and still be able to sleep that night.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8698" target="_blank">02:24:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So it allows more flexibility, it allows more pinpointing of optimizing it for points the day you want to be using it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8708" target="_blank">02:25:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Some people philosophically say that in itself is wrong or bad, that you should be absolutely steady and constant,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8715" target="_blank">02:25:15.800</a></span> | <span class="t">because what we're trying to do is be consistent and reproducible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8719" target="_blank">02:25:19.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And others would say we're trying to treat individuals who have different demands on them and have different patterns during their day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8726" target="_blank">02:25:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So there are different philosophies about what's better or worse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8729" target="_blank">02:25:29.800</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the big downsides of the immediate release though is not only does it go in quickly, it tends to go off quickly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8735" target="_blank">02:25:35.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And most people, not all, but most experience some withdrawal as it's going off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8741" target="_blank">02:25:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And although when we're using this for ADHD, we focus on the cognitive executive function benefits, the focus, the attention, the concentration, and people can experience that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8752" target="_blank">02:25:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Many people who weren't even aware of it increasing their energy feel my energy is crashing as I go off of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8760" target="_blank">02:26:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Or many people who weren't aware that it was actually elevating mood to any extent feel, oh my god, I'm crashing and I'm crying and cranky and miserable now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8769" target="_blank">02:26:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And with the extended release versions, most of them go in more gradually so it can be harder to detect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8776" target="_blank">02:26:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">They last a longer period of the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8779" target="_blank">02:26:19.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And most of them go out much more gradually at the end of the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8783" target="_blank">02:26:23.800</a></span> | <span class="t">The one I like the most for a long-acting amphetamine product is Vyvanse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8790" target="_blank">02:26:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And Vyvanse was designed as a slow-release product.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8794" target="_blank">02:26:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It was designed specifically to be unattractive to drug abusers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8798" target="_blank">02:26:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So Vyvanse chemically links the dextroamphetamine molecule to lysine, one of the amino acids.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8805" target="_blank">02:26:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a basic component of proteins and 20 essential amino acids.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8810" target="_blank">02:26:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you snort it or inject it, you have an inactive prodrug.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8817" target="_blank">02:26:57.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, the list-dexamphetamine, your red blood cells actually have an enzyme that cleaves the lysine and leaves you with the free active dextroamphetamine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8829" target="_blank">02:27:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's the slow-release mechanism is how quickly your red blood cells can do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8834" target="_blank">02:27:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And they have limited capacity to do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8836" target="_blank">02:27:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So although they designed it to be an anti-drug abuse drug, it actually turns out to be one of the sort of most consistently evenly entering the body.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8848" target="_blank">02:27:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">For some people, it goes in so slowly that they say, "I don't feel it."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8853" target="_blank">02:27:33.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And also, towards the end of the day, one of the best in terms of not falling off abruptly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8861" target="_blank">02:27:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">The potential downside is, again, that the capacity of the red blood cells is limited.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8865" target="_blank">02:27:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So at some point, for most people, because that's a rate-limiting step, when you're adding more and more,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8871" target="_blank">02:27:51.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you're actually extending the duration of time more than you're getting a bigger peak</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8876" target="_blank">02:27:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">because your red blood cells just aren't cleaving it fast enough to make more dextroamphetamine available.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8882"

that there are a lot of listeners and viewers who have tried these things or who are considering or, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8926" target="_blank">02:28:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">at one point used them and a lot has evolved in this realm of chemistry for ADHD.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8932" target="_blank">02:28:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But that's very helpful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8934" target="_blank">02:28:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Before we wrap up, I want to make sure that I ask you about something that's been on my mind a lot in general,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8941" target="_blank">02:29:01.800</a></span> | <span class="t">but in particular as it relates to ADHD, which is time perception.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8945" target="_blank">02:29:05.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm basically obsessed with time perception.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8948" target="_blank">02:29:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I've long been fascinated by the fact that we can find slice time when our arousal is high.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8954" target="_blank">02:29:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what presumably gives people the kind of slow motion effect and, you know, very stressful environments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8959" target="_blank">02:29:19.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Versus when we're relaxed, our frame rate on life goes down and it's all very dynamic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8964" target="_blank">02:29:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It's important our brains are able to do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8966" target="_blank">02:29:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But someone recently told me the following.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8969" target="_blank">02:29:29.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Her partner has ADHD and she said that the big rescue to their relationship came when they together read a book about ADHD.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8980" target="_blank">02:29:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And something in there read something like this, that people without ADHD keep track of time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8987" target="_blank">02:29:47.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Whereas people with ADHD don't, but they do know the difference between now and not now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8994" target="_blank">02:29:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But they're not tracking time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=8996" target="_blank">02:29:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">They know that what they're doing in the moment is not what they're going to be doing later or what they did in the past,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9000" target="_blank">02:30:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">but they're not tracking time the same way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9003" target="_blank">02:30:03.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think this ties back to this interest-based attention system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9006" target="_blank">02:30:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">What do we know about time perception in ADHD?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9010" target="_blank">02:30:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And by extension, do you think that these drugs are working in part to change time perception?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9016" target="_blank">02:30:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Good question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9017" target="_blank">02:30:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'd say there's two different angles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9020" target="_blank">02:30:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think, I mean, the one that's easier to objectively measure is putting people in a lab.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9025" target="_blank">02:30:25.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, there's a simple test, a time perception test, and you interrupt them after a certain period.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9032" target="_blank">02:30:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, say, you're going to be estimating how long you're left without interruption.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9037" target="_blank">02:30:37.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And people with ADHD measurably, they're inconsistently inconsistent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9044" target="_blank">02:30:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Consistently inconsistent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9046" target="_blank">02:30:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Consistently inconsistent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9047" target="_blank">02:30:47.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's not that they perpetually underestimate or overestimate, but they are estimating incorrectly much more often than people without ADHD.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9056" target="_blank">02:30:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's something at a basic time processing level that's aberrant there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9065" target="_blank">02:31:05.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's also getting, you know, the real world aspect of not paying attention to cues or not noticing other people left the room or not being distracted, which compounds the situation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9078" target="_blank">02:31:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And, I mean, it's also interesting to the extent to which many people aren't aware.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9083" target="_blank">02:31:23.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So I often ask, even though it's not one of the 18 symptoms, are you chronically late to them?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9090" target="_blank">02:31:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And particularly people who show up late to my office time after time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9093" target="_blank">02:31:33.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So one of my favorite quotes is this person who the session before we had been talking that her boss was giving her threatening notices because she had come in two hours late one day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9107" target="_blank">02:31:47.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And she had all sorts of good excuses of why she couldn't get out the door.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9110" target="_blank">02:31:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And we were talking, you know, are you regularly late?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9114" target="_blank">02:31:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">No, no, no.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9115" target="_blank">02:31:55.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And I said, well, why was the boss so upset?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9117" target="_blank">02:31:57.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I asked, well, when is the expectation?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9120" target="_blank">02:32:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">This is pre-COVID, pre-working.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9122" target="_blank">02:32:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">When is the expectation you're there?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9124" target="_blank">02:32:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">When do you usually show up?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9125" target="_blank">02:32:05.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, well, office starts at 9:00 and I'm usually there by 9:15, 9:20.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9131" target="_blank">02:32:11.800</a></span> | <span class="t">That's not late.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9132" target="_blank">02:32:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">In her mind, it wasn't late.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9135" target="_blank">02:32:15.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So when you ask a question, are you routinely late?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9139" target="_blank">02:32:19.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You're going to get meaningless information on your little checklist unless you know what that means to the individual.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9145" target="_blank">02:32:25.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So the second part of the question, I'm sure it's been done and I don't have the answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9152" target="_blank">02:32:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Whether stimulants or other drugs measurably improve time perception in that laboratory situation of just, can you estimate how much time has elapsed?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9162" target="_blank">02:32:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I should know that, but I don't have that on top of my, and the more global question of how central that's sort of the time aspect of organization of thoughts and attention is to the content of disorganization.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9179" target="_blank">02:32:59.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, there are some research groups, I think it's mainly a Danish group, who's feeling that ADHD is primarily a circadian rhythm disruption, that that's the central neurologic issue at play.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9193" target="_blank">02:33:13.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's interesting, I got to do work in the early 80s on bright light therapy for winter depression, which has a measurable impact as strong as medication, but there is one or two studies done on individuals with ADHD without any seasonal depression, without any depression at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9214" target="_blank">02:33:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And just those same bright lights showing them, you know, a dose of bright lights early in the morning, measurably improved a broad range of ADHD symptoms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9225" target="_blank">02:33:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And the claim was that that was working because it was helping resynchronize internal rhythms, which are out of sync in ADHD.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9233" target="_blank">02:33:53.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Whether that's exactly the same thing you were getting at, but certainly if you have, I mean, even though we have a sort of master clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, we also have clocks throughout our body and they're talking and interacting and ostensibly synchronized and working with each other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9251" target="_blank">02:34:11.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But it could well be that for many people they're not and that getting that to work is essential.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9258" target="_blank">02:34:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you for those

those different nodes interact with one another because of course they do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtQ-kdLlQiU&t=9307"
