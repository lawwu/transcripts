target="_blank">00:01:46.360</a></span> | <span class="t">came over in the summer of 2015.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiuH8swINO8&t=108"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiuH8swINO8&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, he understood what it took to be a professional.</span></div><div class="c"><span

couldn't quite tell what, what to do with both of them because Yusuf, I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiuH8swINO8&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">think had made second team all rookie, um, and Nicola was coming over.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiuH8swINO8&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we had a very established center and, but we knew that they both had really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiuH8swINO8&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">good hands, really good

that was unfortunate is the league was trending.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiuH8swINO8&t=155" target="_blank">00:02:35.920</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:02:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">to this small ball, you know, shooting everywhere and even more extreme than it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiuH8swINO8&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">it was tough, it was a tough for them to cover whenever you got, you know, kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiuH8swINO8&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.680</a></span> | <span class="t">almost four guards out there moving

target="_blank">00:03:14.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And fortunately by the time, um, after, after Nicola's first, first season, I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiuH8swINO8&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">think he made first team all rookie.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiuH8swINO8&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and then we were halfway into the second year and, uh, we were really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiuH8swINO8&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.760</a></span> | <span class="t">realizing that we couldn't, we

target="_blank">00:03:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we were having our analytics group run all the different numbers of how to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiuH8swINO8&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.560</a></span> | <span class="t">compare the two and what to look for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
