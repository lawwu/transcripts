Social media became much more poisonous, and we realized</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0e93HvA2jw&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">we can embrace digital communication without having to embrace yelling at people over Twitter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0e93HvA2jw&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">windows.

It was like we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0e93HvA2jw&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">were in a Kafka play doing some sort of absurdist satire about the modern working life where we just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0e93HvA2jw&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">did meetings all day long and never actually got to doing work.

So that's one thing I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0e93HvA2jw&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.920</a></span> | <span class="t">learned.
